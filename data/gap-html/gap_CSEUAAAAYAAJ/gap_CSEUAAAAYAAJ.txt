Frontiers of the Eastern Empire ibolilion of the Schools of Athens and the Consulship of Home The emperor Justinian was born l near the ruins of Sardica the modern So phia of an obscure race 2 of barbarians 3 the inhabitants of a wild and deso late country to which the names of Dardania of Dacia and of Bulgaria have been successively applied His elevation was prepared by the adventurous spirit of his uncle Justin who with two other peasants of the same village deserted for the profession of arms the more useful employment of husbandmen or shep herds 4 On foot with a scanty provision of biscuit in their knapsacks the three youths followed the high road to Constantinople and were soon enrolled for their strength and stature among the guards of the emperor Leo Under the two suc ceeding reigns the fortunate peasant emerged to wealth and honours and his es cape from some dangers which threatened his life was afterward ascribed to the guardian angel who watches over the fate of kings His long and laudable service in the Isaurian and Persian wars would not have preserved from oblivion the name of Justin yet they might warrant the military promotion which in the course of fifty years he gradually obtained the rank of tribune of count and of general the dignity of senator and the command of the guards who obeyed him as their chief at the important crisis when the emperor Anastasius was removed from the world The powerful kinsmen whom he had raised and enriched were excluded from the throne and the eunuch Amantius who reigned in the palace had secretly resolved to fix the diadem on the head of the most obsequious of his creatures A liberal donative to conciliate the suffrage of the guards was intrusted for that pur pose in the hands of their commander But these weighty arguments were trea cherously employed by Justin in his own favour and as no competitor presumed to appear the Dacian peasant was invested with the purple by the unanimous consent of the soldiers who knew him to be brave and gentle of the clergy and people who believed him to be orthodox and of the provincials who yielded a blind and implicit submission to the will of the capital The

Odymy A THE DECLINE AND FALL distinguished from another emperor of the same family and name ascended the Byzantine throne at the age of sixty eight years and had he been left to his own guidance every moment of a nine year s reign must have exposed to his subjects the impropriety of their choice His ignorance was similar to that of Theodoric and it is remarkable that in an age not destitute of learning two cotemporary monarchs had never been instructed in the knowledge of the alphabet But the genius of Justin was far inferior to that of the Gothic king the experience of a sol dier had not qualified him for the government of an empire and though person ally brave the consciousness of his own weakness was naturally attended with doubt distrust and political apprehension But the official business of the state was diligently and faithfully transacted by the questor Proclus l and the aged emperor adopted the talents and ambition of his nephew Justinian an aspiring youth whom his uncle had drawn from the ructic solitude of Dacia and educated at Constantinople as the heir of his private fortune and at length of the eastern empire Since the eunuch Amantius had been defrauded of his money it became ne cessary to deprive him of his life The task was easily accomplished by the charge of a real or fictitious conspiracy and the judges were informed as an ac cumulation of guilt that he was secretly addicted to the Manichxan heresy 2 Amantius lost his head three of his companions the first domestics of the palace were punished either with death or exile and their unfortunate candidate for the purple was cast into a deep dungeon overwhelmed with stones and ignominiously thrown without burial into the sea The ruin of Vitalian was a work of more diffi culty and danger That Gothic chief had rendered himself popular by the civil war which he boldly waged against Anastasius for the defence of tlie orthodox faith and after the conclusion of an advantageous treaty he still remained in the neighbour hood of Constantinople at the head of a formidable and victorious army of barba rians By the frail security of oaths he was tempted to relinquish this advantageous situation and to trust his person within the walls of a city whose inhabitants parti cularly the blue faction were artfully incensed against him by the remembrance even of his pious hostilities The emperor and his nephew embraced him as the faithful and worthy champion of the church and state and gratefully adorned their favourite with the titles of consul and general but in the seventh month of his consulship Vitalian was stabbed with seventeen wounds at the royal banquet 3 and Justinian who inherited the spoil was accused as the assassin of a spiritual brother to whom he had recently pledged his faith in the participation of the Christian mysteries 4 After the fall of his rival he was promoted without any claim of military service to the office of master general of the eastern armies whom it was his duty to lead into the field against the public enemy But in the pursuit of fame Justinian might have lost his present dominion over the age and weakness of his uncle and instead of acquiring by Scythian or Persian trophies the applause of his countrymen 5 the prudent warrior solicited their favour in the churches the circus and the senate of Constantinople The catholics were attached to the nephew of Justin who between the Nestorian and Eutvchian he resies trod the narrow path of inflexible and intolerant orthodoxy 6 in the first days of the new reign he prompted and gratified the popular enthusiasm against the memory of the deceased emperor After a schism of thirty four vears he re conciled the proud and angry spirit of the Roman pontiff and spread among the Latins a favourable report of his pious respect for the apostolic see The thrones of the east were filled with catholic bishops devoted to his interest the clergy and the monks were gained by his liberality and the people were taught to pray for their future sovereign the hope and pillar of the true religion The magnifi 1 His virtues are praised by Procopius Persic lib i c II Tlie questor

with their rich trappings was bestowed as an extraordinary gift on the victorious charioteers of the circus While lie indulged the people of Constanti nople and received the addresses of foreign kings the nephew of Justin assidu ously cultivated the friendship of the senate That venerable name seemed to qualify its members to declare the sense of the nation and to regulate the succes sion of the imperial throne the feeble Ana tasius had permitted the vigour of go vernment to degenerate into the form or substance of an aristocracy and the mi litary officers who had obtained the senatorial rank were followed by their do mestic guards a band of veterans whose arms or acclamations might fix in a tu multuous moment the diadem of the east The treasures of the state were la vished to procure the voices of the senators sRid their unanimous wish that he would be pleased to adopt Justinian for his colleague was communicated to the emperor But this request which too clearly admonished him of his approaching end was unwelcome to the jealous temper of an aged monarch desirous to retain the power which he was incapable of exercising and Justin holding his purple with both his hands advised them to prefer since an election was so profitable some older candidate Notwithstanding this reproach the senate proceeded to decorate Justinian with the royal epithet of nobilissimus and their decree was ra tified by the affection or the fears of his uncle After some time the languor of mind and body to which he was reduced by an incurable wound in his thigh in dispensably required the aid of a guardian He summoned the patriarch and se  nators and in their presence solemnly placed the diadem on the head of his ne phew who was conducted from the palace to the circus and saluted by the loud and joyful applause of the people The life of Justin was prolonged about four months but from the instant of this ceremony he was considered as dead to the empire which acknowledged Justinian in the forty fifth year of his age for the lawful sovereign of the east l From his elevation to his death Justinian governed the Roman empire thirty eight years seven months and thirteen days The events of his reign which ex cite our curious attention by their number variety and importance are diligently related by the secretary of Belisarius a rhetorician whom eloquence had promo ted to the rank of senator and prefect of Constantinople According to the vi cissitudes of courage or servitude of favour or disgrace Procopius 2 successively composed the history the panegyric and the satire of his own times The eight books of the Persian Vandalic and Gothic wars 3 which are continued in the five books of Agathias deserve our esteem as a laborious and successful imitation of the Attic or at least of the Asiatic writers of ancient Greece His facts are collected from the personal experience and free conversation of a soldier a statesman and a traveller his style continually aspires and often attains to the merit of strength and elegance his reflections more especially in the speeches which he too frequently inserts contain a rich fund of political knowledge and the historian excited by the generous ambition of pleasing and instructing pos terity appears to disdain the prejudices of the people and the flattery of courts The writings of Procopius 4 were read and applauded by his

pride of Justinian must have been wounded by the praise of a hero who perpetually eclipses the glory of his inactive sovereign The conscious dignity of independence was subdued by the hopes and fears of a slave and the secretary of Belisarius laboured for pardon and reward in the six books of the imperial edifices He had dexterously chosen a subject of apparent splendour in which he could loudly celebrate the genius the magnificence and the piety of a prince who both as a conqueror and legislator had surpassed the puerile virtues of Themistocles and Cyrus 2 Disappointment might urge the flatterer to secret revenge and the first glance of favour might again tempt him to suspend and suppress a libel 3 in which the Roman Cyrus is degraded into an odious and contemptible tyrant in which both the emperor and his consort Theodora are seriously represented as two demons who had as sumed a human form for the destruction of mankind 4 Such base inconsistency must doubtless sully the reputation and detract from the credit of Procopius yet after the venom of his malignity hj s been suffered to exhale the residue of the anecdotes even the most disgraceful facts some of which had been tenderly hint ed in his public history are established by their internal evidence or the authen tic monuments of thetimes 5 From these various materials I shall now pro ceed to describe the reign of Justinian which will deserve and occupy an ample space The present chapter will explain the elevation and character of Theodo ra the factions of the circus and the peaceful administration of the sovereign of the east In the three succeeding chapters I shall relate the wars of Justinian which achieved the conquest of Africa and Italy and I shall follow the victories of Belisarius and Narses without disguising the vanity of their triumphs or the hostile virtue of the Persian and Gothic heroes The series of this volume will embrace the jurisprudence and theology of the emperor the controversies and sects which still divide the oriental church the reformation of the Roman law which is obeyed or respected by the nations of modern Europe I In the exercise of supreme power the first act of Justinian was to divide it with the woman whom he loved the famous Theodora 6 whose strange eleva tion cannot be applauded as the triumph of female virtue Under the reign of Anastasius the care of the wild beasts maintained by the green faction of Con stantinople was intrusted to Acacius a native of the isle of Cypress who from his employment was surnamed the master of the bears This honourable office was given after his death to another candidate notwithstanding the diligence of his widow who had already provided a husband and a successor Acacius had left three daughters Comito 7 Theodora and Anastasia the eldest of whom did not then exceed the age of seven years On a solemn festival these helpless orphans were sent by their distressed and indignant mother in the garb of sup phants into the midst of the theatre the green faction received them with con tempt the blues with compassion and this difference which sunk deep into the mind of Theodora was felt long afterward in the administration of the empire As they improved in age and beauty the three sisters were successively devoted to the public and private pleasures of the Byzantine people and Theodora after following Comito on the stage in the dress of a slave with a stool on her head was at length permitted to exercise her independent talents She neither danced nor sung nor played on the flute her skill was confined to the pantomime arts she excelled in buffoon characters and as often as the comedian swelled her Maltref a Jesuit of Thoulouse in 1663 fur distant from the Louvre press and the

complained with a ridiculous tone and gesture of the blows that were inflicted the whole theatre of Constantinople resounded with laughter and ap plause The beauty of Theodora l was the subject of more flattering praise and the source of more exquisite delight Her features were delicate and regu lar her complexion though somewhat pale was tinged with a natural colour every sensation was instantly expressed by the vivacity of her eyes her easy mo tions displayed the graces of a small but elegant figure and either love or adula tion might proclaim that painting and poetry were incapable of delineating the matchless excellence of her form But this form was degraded by the facility with which it was exposed to the public eye and prostituted to licentious desire Her venal charms were abandoned to a promiscuous crowd of citizens and stran gers of every rank and of every profession the fortunate lover who had been promised a night of enjoyment was often driven from her bed by a stronger or more wealthy favourite and when she passed through the streets her presence was avoided by all who wished to escape either the scandal or the temptation The satirical historian has not blushed 2 to describe the naked scenes which Theodora was not ashamed to exhibit in the theatre 3 After exhausting the arts of sensual pleasure 4 she most ungratefully murmured against the parsimo ny of nature 5 but her murmurs her pleasures and her arts must be veiled in the obscurity of a learned language After reigning for some time the delight and contempt of the capital she condescended to accompany Ecebolus a native of Tyre who had obtained the government of the African Pentapolis But this union was frail and transient Ecebolus soon rejected an expensive or faithless con cubine she was reduced at Alexandria to extreme distress and in her laborious return to Constantinople every city of the east admired and enjoyed the fair Cy prian whose merit appeared to justify her descent from the peculiar island of Ve nus The vague commerce of Theodora and the most detestable precautions preserved her from the danger which she feared yet once and once only she became a mother The infant was saved and educated in Arabia by his father who imparted to him on his deathbed that he was the son of an empress Filled with ambitious hopes the unsuspecting youth immediately hastened to the pa lace of Constantinople and was admitted to the presence of his mother As he was never more seen even after the decease of Theodora she deserves the foul imputation of extinguishing with his life a secret so offensive to her imperial vir tue In the most abject state of her fortune and reputation some vision either of sleep or of fancy had whispered to Theodora the pleasing assurance that she was destined to become the spouse of a potent monarch Conscious of her approach ing greatness she returned from Paphlagonia to Constantinople assumed like a skilful actress a more decent character relieved her poverty by the laudable in dustry of spinning wool and affected a life of chastity and solitude in a small house which she afterward changed into a magnificent temple 6 Her beauty assisted by art or accident soon attracted captivated and fixed the patrician Justinian who already reigned with absolute sway under the name of his uncle Perhaps she con trived to enhance the value of a gift which she had so often lavished on the mean est of mankind perhaps she inflamed at first by modest delays and at last by sensual allurements the desires of a lover who from nature

abstemious diet When his first transports had subsided she still maintained the same ascendant over his mind by the more solid merit of temper and understanding Justinian delighted to ennoble and enrich the object of his affection the treasures of the east were poured at her feet and the nephew of Justin was determined perhaps by religious scruples to bestow on his concubine the sacred and legal character of a wife But the laws of Rome expressly pro hibited the marriage of a senator with any female who had been dishonoured by a servile origin or theatrical profession the empress Lupicina or Euphemia a bar barian of rustic manners but of irreproachable virtue refused to accept a prosti tute for her niece and even Vigilantia the superstitious mother of Justinian though she acknowledged the wit and beauty of Theodora was seriously appre hensive lest the levity and arrogance of that artful paramour might corrupt the piety and happiness of her son These obstacles were removed by the inflexible constancy of Justinian He patiently expected the death of the empress he de spised the tears of his mother who soon sunk under the weight of her affliction and a law was promulgated in the name of the emperor Justin which abolished the rigid jurisprudence of antiquity A glorious repentance the words of the edict was left open for the unhappy females who had prostituted their persons on the theatre and they were permitted to contract a legal union with the most illus trious of the Romans 1 This indulgence was speedily followed by the solemn nuptials of Justinian and Theodora her dignity was gradually exalted with that of her lover and as soon as Justin had invested his nephew with the purple the patriarch of Constantinople placed the diadem on the heads of the emperor and empress of the east But the usual honours which the severity of Roman manners had allowed to the wives of princes could not satisfy either the ambition of The odora or the fondness of Justinian He seated her on the throne as an equal and independent colleague in the sovereignty of the empire and an oath of allegiance was imposed on the governors of the provinces in the joint names of Justinian and Theodora 2 The eastern world fell prostrate before the genius and fortune of the daughter of Acacius The prostitute who in the presence of innumerable spectators had polluted the theatre of Constantinople was adored as a queen in the same city by grave magistrates orthodox bishops victorious generals and captive monarchs 3 Those who believe that the female mind is totally depraved by the loss of chas tity will eagei ly listen to all the invectives of private envy or popular resentment which have dissembled the virtues of Theodora exaggerated her vices and con demned with rigour the venal or voluntary sins of the youthful harlot From a motive of shame or contempt she often declined the servile homage of the multi tude escaped from the odious light of the capital and passed the greatest part of the year in the palaces and gardens which were pleasantly seated on the sea coast of the Propontis and the Bosphorus Her private hours were devoted to the pru dent as well as grateful care of her beauty the luxury of the bath and table and the long slumber of the evening and the morning Her secret apartments were occupied by the favourite women and eunuchs whose interests and passions she indulged at the expense of justice the most illustrious personages of the state were crowded into a dark and sultry antichamber and when at last after a tedious attendance they were admitted to kiss the feet of Theodora they experienced as her humour might suggest the silent arrogance of an empress or the capricious levity of a comedian Her rapacious avarice to accumulate an immense treasure may be excused by the apprehension of her husband s death which could leave no alternative between ruin arid the throne and fear as well as ambition might ex asperate Theodora against two generals who during a malady of the emperor had rashly declared that they were not disposed to acquiesce in the choice of the capital But the reproach of cruelty so repugnant even to her softer vices has left an indelible stain on the memory of Theodora Her numerous spies observed and zealously reported every action word or look injurious to their royal mistress 1 See the old

fury of the emperor the present age will allow some merit to her religion and much in dulgence to her speculative errors 4 The name of Theodora was introduced with equal honour in all the pious and charitable foundations of Justinian and the most benevolent institution of his reign may be ascribed to the sympathy of the empress for her less fortunate sisters who had been seduced or compelled to embrace the trade of prostitution A palace on the Asiatic side of the Bospho rus was converted into a stately and spacious monastery and a liberal mainte nance was assigned to five hundred women who had been collected from the streets and brothels of Constantinople In this safe and holy retreat they were devoted to perpetual confinement and the despair of some who threw themselves headlong into the sea was lost in the gratitude of the penitents who had been de livered from sin and misery by their generous benefactress 5 The prudence of Theodora is celebrated by Justinian himself and his laws are attributed to the sage counsels of his most revered wife whom he had received as the gift of the Deity 6 Her courage was displayed amidst the tumult of the people and the terrors of the court Her chastity from the moment of her union with Justinian is founded on the silence of her implacable enemies and although the daughter of Acacius might be satisfied with love yet some applause is due to the firmness of a mind which could sacrifice pleasure and habit to the stronger sense either of duty or interest The wishes and prayers of Theodora could never obtain the blessing of a lawful son and she buried an infant daughter the sole offspring of her marriage 7 Notwithstanding this disappointment her dominion was per manent and absolute she preserved by art or merit the affections of Justinian and their seeming dissensions were always fatal to the courtiers who believed them to be sincere Perhaps her health had been impaired by the licentiousness of her youth but it was always delicate and she was directed by her physicians to use the Pythian warm baths In this journey the empress was followed by the pre torian prefect the great treasurer several counts and patricians and a splendid train of four thousand attendants the highways were repaired at her approach a palace was erected for her reception and as she passed through Bithynia she distributed liberal alms to the churches the monasteries and the hospitals that they might implore Heaven for the restoration of her health 8 At length in the twenty fourth year of her marriage and the twenty second of her reign she was consumed by a cancer 9 and the irreparable loss was deplored by her lms 1 Her prison a labyrinth a Tarlarm Anecdot c 4 were under Ihe palace Darkness is propitious to cruelty but it is likewise

v 55 61 Vol III 2 10 THE DECLINE AND FALL t band who in the room of a theatrical prostitute might have selected the purest and most noble virgin of the cast l II A material difference may be observed in the games of antiquity the most eminent of the Greeks were actors the Romans were merely spectators The Olympic stadium was open to wealth merit and ambition and if the candidates could depend on their personal skill and activity they might pursue the footsteps of Diomede and Menelaus and conduct their own horses in the rapid career 2 Ten twenty forty chariots were allowed to start at the same instant a crown of leaves was the reward of the victor and his fame with that of his family and country was chanted in lyric strains more durable than monuments of brass and marble But a senator or even a citizen conscious of his dignity would have blushed to expose his person or his horses in the circus of Rome The games were exhibited at the expense of the republic the magistrates or the emperors but the reins were abandoned to servile hands and if the profits of a favourite charioteer sometimes exceeded those of an advocate they must be considered as the effects of popular extravagance and the high wages of a disgraceful profes sion The race in its first institution was a simple contest of two chariots whose drivers were distinguished by white and red liveries two additional colours a light green and a cerulean blue were afterward introduced and as the races were re peated twenty five times one hundred chariots contributed in the same day to the pomp of the circus The four factions soon acquired a legal establishment and a mysterious origin and their fanciful colours were derived from the various appearances of nature in the four seasons of the year the red dog star of summer the snows of winter the deep shades of autumn and the cheerful verdure of the spring 3 Another interpretation preferred the elements to the seasons and the struggle of the green and blue was supposed to represent the conflict of the earth and sea Their respective victories announced either a plentiful harvest or a prosperous navigation and the hostility of the husbandmen and mariners was somewhat less absurd than the blind ardour of the Roman people who devoted their lives and fortunes to the colour which they espoused Such folly was dis dained and indulged by the wisest princes but the names of Caligula Nero Vi tellius Verus Commodus Caracaila and Elagabalus were enrolled in the blue or green factions of the circus they frequented their stables applauded their fa vourites chastised their antagonists and deserved the esteem of the populace by the natural or affected imitation of their manners The bloody and tumultuous contest continued to disturb the public festivity till the last age of the spectacles of Rome and Theodoric from a motive of justice or affection interposed his au thority to protect the greens against the violence of a consul and a patrician who were passionately addicted to the blue faction of the circus 4 Constantinople adopted the follies though not the virtues of ancient Rome and the same factions which had agitated the circus raged with redoubled fury in the hippodrome Under the reign of Anastasius this popular phrenzy was inflamed by religious zeal and the greens who had treacherously concealed stones and daggers under baskets of fruit massacred at a solemn festival three thousand of their blue adversaries 5 From the capital this pestilence was diffused into the provinces and cities of the east and the sportive distinction of two colours pro duced two strong and irreconcilable factions which shook the foundations of a feeble government 6 The popular dissensions founded on the most serious in terest or holy pretence have scarcely equalled the obstinacy of this wanton dis cord which invaded the peace of families divided friends and brothers and 1 Ai she persecuted the popei and rejected a council

inveteracy of the evil OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE i 1 tempted the female sex though seldom seen in the circus to espouse the inclina tion of their lovers or to contradict the wishes of their husbands Every law either human or divine was trampled under foot and as long as the party was successful its deluded followers appeared careless of private distress or public calamity The license without the freedom of democracy was revived at An tioch and Constantinople and the support of a faction became necessary to every candidate for civil or ecclesiastical honours A secret attachment to the family or sect of Anastasius was imputed to the greens the blues were zealously devoted to the cause of orthodoxy and Justinian l and their grateful patron protected above five years the disorders of a faction whose seasonable tumults overawed the palace the senate and the capitals of the east Insolent with royal favour the blues affected to strike terror by a peculiar and barbaric dress the long hair of the Huns their close sleeves and ample garments a lofty step and a sonorous voice In the day they concealed their two edged poniards but in the night they boldly assembled in arms and in numerous bands prepared for every act of violence and rapine Their adversaries of the green faction or even inoffensive citizens were stripped and often murdered by these nocturnal robbers and it be came dangerous to wear any gold buttons or girdles or to appear at a late hour in the streets of a peaceful capital A daring spirit rising with impunity pro ceeded to violate the safeguard of private houses and fire was employed to faci litate the attack or to conceal the crimes of those factious rioters No place was safe or sacred from their depredations to gratify either avarice or revenge they profusely spilt the blood of the innocent churches and altars were polluted by atrocious murders and it was the boast of the assassins that their dexterity couldalways inflict a mortal wound with a single stroke of their dagger The dissolute youth of Constantinople adopted the blue livery of disorder the laws were silent and the bonds of society were relaxed creditors were compelled to resign their obligations judges to reverse their sentence masters to enfranchise their slaves fathers to supply the extravagance of their children noble matrons were prostituted the lust of their servants beautiful boys were torn from the arms of their parettts and wives unless they preferred a voluntary death were ravished in the presence of their husbands 2 The despair of the greens who were persecuted by their enemies and deserted by the magistrate assumed the privilege of defence perhaps of retaliation but those who survived the combat were dragged to execution and the unhappy fugitives escaping to woods and ca verns preyed without mercy on the society from whence they were expelled Those ministers of justice who had courage to punish the crimes and to brave the re sentment of the blues became the victims of their indiscreet zeal a prefect of Con stantinople fled for refuge to the holy sepulchre a count of the east was ignomi niously whipped and a governor of Cilicia was hanged by the order of Theodora on the tomb of two assassins whom he had condemned for the murder of his groom and a daring attack upon his own life 3 An aspiring candidate may be tempted to build his greatness on the public confusion but it is the interest as well as duty of a sovereign to maintain the authority of the laws The first edict of Justinian which was often repeated and sometimes executed announced his firm resolution to support the innocent and to chastise the guiltv of every denomi nation and colour Yet the balance of justice was still inclined in favour of the blue faction by the secret affection the habits and the fears of the emperor his equity after an apparent straggle submitted without reluctance to the implaca ble passions of Theodora and the empress never forgot or forgave the injuries of the comedian At the accession of the younger Justin the proclamation of equal and rigorous justice indirectly condemned the partiality of the former reigns  Ye blues

DECLINE AND FALL were incessantly disturbed by the clamorous discontent of the greens till the twenty second race the emperor maintained his silent gravity at length yielding to his impatience he condescended to hold in abrupt sentences and by the voice of a crier the most singular dialogue l that ever passed between a prince and his subjects Their first complaints were respectful and modest they accused the subordinate ministers of oppression and proclaimed their wishes for the long life and victory of the emperor  Be patient and attentive ye insolent railers ex claimed Justinian be mute ye Jews Samaritans and Manich cans  The greens still attempted to awaken his compassion  We are poor we are inno cent we are injured we dare not pass through the streets a general persecution is exercised against our name and colour Let us die 0 emperor but let us die by your command and for your service But the repetition of partial and pas sionate invectives degraded in their eyes the majesty of the purple they re nounced allegiance to the prince who refused justice to his people lamented that the father of Justinian had been born and branded his son with the opprobrious names of a homicide an ass and a perjured tyrant  Do you despise your lives cried the indignant monarch the blues rose with fury from their seats their hos tile clamours thundered in the hippodrome and their adversaries deserting the unequal contest spread terror and despair through the streets of Constantinople At this dangerous moment seven notorious assassins of both factions who had been condemned by the prefect were carried round the city and afterward transported to the place of execution in the suburb of Pera Four were imme diately beheaded a fifth was hanged but when the same punishment was in flicted on the remaining two the rope broke they fell alive to the ground the po pulace applauded their escape and the monks of St Conon issuing from the neighbouring convent conveyed them in a boat to the sanctuary of the church 2 As one of these criminals was of the blue and the other of the green livery the two factions were equally provoked by the cruelty of their oppressor or the in gratitude of their patron and a short truce was concluded till they had delivered their prisoners and satisfied their revenge The palace of the Refect who with stood the seditious torrent was instantly burnt his officers and guards were mas sacred the prisons were forced open and freedom was restored to those who could only use it for the public destruction A military force which had been des patched to the aid of the civil magistrate was fiercely encountered by an armed multitude whose numbers and boldness continually increased and the Heruli the wildest barbarians in the service of the empire overturned the priests and their relics which from a pious motive had been rashly interposed to separate the bloody conflict The tumult was exasperated by this sacrilege the people fought with enthusiasm in the cause of God the women from the roofs and win dows showered stones on the heads of the soldiers who darted firebrands against the houses and the various flames which had been kindled by the hands ot citi zens and strangers spread without control over the face of the city The con flagration involved the cathedral of St Sophia the baths of Zeuxippus a part of the palace from the first entrance to the altar of Mars and the long portico from the palace to the forum of Constantine a large hospital with the sick patients was consumed many churches and stately edifices were destroyed and an im mense treasure of gold and silver was either melted or lost From such scenes of horror and distress the wise and wealthy citizens escaped over the Bosphorus to the Asiatic side and during five days Constantinople was abandoned to the factions whose watchword Nika vanquish has given a name to this memorable sedition 3 As long as the factions were divided the triumphant blues and desponding greens appeared to behold with the same indifference the disorders of the state They agreed to censure the corrupt management of justice and the finance and the two responsible ministers the artful Tribonian and the rapacious John of Cap padocia were loudly arraigned as the authors of the public misery The peace ful murmurs cf the people would have been disregarded they were heard with respect when the city was in flames the questor and the prefect were instantly removed and their offices were filled by two senators of blameless integrity Af 1 This dialogue which Theophancs has

hippodrome to confess his own errors and to accept the repentance of his grateful subjects but they distrust ed his assurances though solemnly pronounced in the presence of the holy gospels and the emperor alarmed by their distrust retreated with precipitation to the strong fortress of the palace The obstinacy of the tumult was now imputed to a secret and ambitious conspiracy and a suspicion was entertained that the insur gents more especially the green faction had been supplied with arms and money by Hypatius and Pompcy two patricians who could neither forget with honour nor remember with safety that they were the nephews of the emperor Anastasius Capriciously trusted disgraced and pardoned by the jealous levity of the mo narch they had appeared as loyal servants before the throne and during five days of the tumult they were detained as important hostages till at length the feat s of Justinian prevailing over his prudence he viewed the two brothers in the light of spies perhaps of assassins and sternly commanded them to depart from the palace After a fruitless representation that obedience might lead to involun tary treason they retired to their houses and in the morning of the sixth day Hy patius was surrounded and seized by the people who regardless of his virtuous rc sistance and the tears of his wife transported their favourite to the forum of Con stantine and instead of a diadem placed a rich collar on his head If the usurper â who afterward pleaded the merit of his delay had complied with the advice of the senate and urged the fury of the multitude their first irresistible effort might have oppressed or expelled his trembling competitor The Byzantine palace enjoyed a free communication with the sea vessels lay ready at the garden stairs and a se cret resolution was already formed to convey the emperor with his family and treasures to a safe retreat at some distance from the capital Justinian was lost if the prostitute whom he raised from the theatre had not re nounced the timidity as well as the virtues of her sex In the midst of a council where Belisarius was present Theodora alone displayed the spirit of a hero and she alone without apprehending his future hatred could save the emperor from the imminent danger and his unworthy fears  If flight said the consort of Jus tinian  were the only means of safety yet I should disdain to fly Death is the condition of our birth but they who have reigned should never survive the loss cf dignity and dominion I implore Heaven that I may never be seen not a day â without my diadem and purple that I may no longer behold the light when i cease to be saluted with the name of queen If you resolve O Caesar to fly you have treasures behold the sea you have ships but tremble lest the desire of life should expose you to wretched exile and ignominious death  For my own part I adhere to the maxim of antiquity that the throne is a glorious sepulchre The firmness of a woman restored the courage to deliberate and act and courage soon discovers the resources of the most desperate situation It was an easy and a de cisive measure to revive the animosity of the factions the blues were astonished at their own guilt and folly that a trifling injury should provoke them to conspire with their implacable enemies against a gracious and liberal benefactor they again proclaimed the majesty of Justinian and the greens with their upstart emperor were left alone in the hippodrome The fidelity of the guards was doubtful but the military force of Justinian consisted in three thousand veterans who had been trained to valour and discipline in the Persian and Illyrian wars Under the com mand Â of Belisarius and Mundus they silently marched in two divisions from the palace forced their obscure way through narrow passages expiring flames and falling edifices and burst open at the same moment the two opposite gates of the hippodrome In this narrow space the disorderly and affrighted crowd was incar pable of resisting on either side a firm and regular attack the blues signalized the fury of their repentance and it is computed that above thirty thousand persons were slain in the merciless and promiscuous carnage of the day Hypatius was dragged from his throne and conducted with his brother Pompey to the feet of the emperor they implored his clemency but their crime was manifest their inno cence uncertain and Justinian had been too much terrified to forgive The next morning the two nephews of Anastasius with eighteen illustrious accomplices of patrician or consular rank were privately executed by the soldiers their bodies were thrown into the sea their palaces rased and their fortunes confiscated The hippodrome itself was condemned during several years to a mournful silence with the restoration of the games the same disorders revived and the blue and green factions continued to afflict the reign of Justinian and to disturb the tranquillity of the eastern empire l I Marccllinus says in general tcrraS innumeris populii in circo trucidatis rrocopius numbers thirty 11 THE DECLINE AND FALL III That empire after Home was barbarous still embraced the nations whom she had conquered beyond the Hadriatic and as far as the frontiers of Ethiopia and Persia Justinian reigned over sixty four provinces and nine hundred and thirty five cities l his

of the Nile from ancient Troy to the Egyptian Thebes Abraham 2 had been relieved by the well known plenty of Egypt the same country a small and populous tract was still capable of exporting each year two hundred and sixty thousand quarters of wheat for the use of Constantinople 3 and the capital of Justinian was sup plied with the manufactures of Sidon fifteen centuries afterthey had been

care of successive generations Tradition preserved and experience simpli fied the humble practice of the arts society was enriched by the division of la bour and the facility of exchange and every

successfully employed to improve the labours of the loom In the choice of those colours 5 which im itate the beauties of nature the freedom of taste and fashion was indulged but the deep purple 6 which the Phoenicians extracted from a shell fish was re strained to the sacred person and palace of the emperor and the penalties of trea son were denounced against the ambitious subjects who dared to usurp the prero gative of the throne 7 I need not explain that silk 8 is originally spun from the bowels of a caterpillar and that it composes the golden tomb from whence a worm emerges in the form of a butterfly Till the reign of Iustinian the silk worms who feed on the leaves of the white mulberry tree were confined to China those of the pine the oak and the ash were common in the forests both of Asia and Europe but as their educa tion is more difficult and their produce more uncertain they were generally ne glected except in the little island of Ceos near the coast of Attica A thin gauze was procured from their webs and Cean manufacture the invention of a woman for female use was long admired both in the east and at Rome Whatever sus picions may be raised by the garments of the Medes

exposing to the public eye naked draperies and transparent matrons 1 A dress which showed the turn of the limbs and colour of the skin might gratify vanity or provoke desire the silks which had been closely woven in China were sometimes unravelled by the Phoenician women and theprecious materials were multiplied by a looser tex ture and the intermixture of linen threads 2 Two hundred years after the age of Pliny the use of pure or even of mixed silks was confined to the female sex till the opulent citizens of Rome and the provinces were insensibly familiarized with the example of Elagabalus the first who by this effeminate habit had sullied the dignity of an emperor and a man Aurelian complained that a pound of silk sold at Rome for twelve ounces of gold but the supply increased with the de mand and the price diminished with the supply If accident or monopoly some times raised the value even above the standard of Aurelian the manufacturers of Tyre and Berytus were sometimes compelled by the operation of the same causes to content themselves with a ninth part of that extravagant rate 3 A law was thought necessary to discriminate the dress of comedians from that of senators and of

considered the citizen and the traveller as the objects of law ful rapine To escape the Tartar robbers and the tyrants of Persia the silk ca ravans explored a more southern road they traversed the mountains of Thibet descended the streams of the Ganges or the Indus and patiently expected in the ports of Guzerat and Malabar the annual fleets of the west l But the dangers of the desert were found less intolerable than toil hunger and the loss of time the attempt was seldom renewed and the only European who has passed that unfrequented way applauds his own diligence that in nine months after his de parture from Pekin he reached the mouth of the Indus The ocean however was open to the free communication of mankind From the great river to the tropic of Cancer the provinces of China were

peninsula are faintly delineated S as the regions of gold and silver and the trading cities named in the geography of Ptolemy may indicate that this wealth was not solely derived from the mines The direct interval between Su matra and Ceylon is about three hundred leagues the Chinese and Indian navi gators were conducted by the flight of birds and periodical winds and the ocean might be securely traversed in square built ships which instead of iron were sewed together with the strong thread of the cocoa nut Ceylon Serendib or Taprobana was divided between two hostile princes one of whom possessed the mountains the elephants and the luminous carbuncle and the other enjoyed the more solid riches of domestic industry foreign trade and the capacious harbour of Trinquemale which received

voy ages aloes cloves nutmeg and santal wood maintained a free and beneficial com merce with the inhabitants of the Persian gulf The subjects of the great king exalted without a rival his power and magnificence and the Roman who confounded their vanity by comparing his paltry coin with a gold medal of the emperor Anastasius had sailed to Ceylon in an Ethiopian ship as a simple pas senger As silk became of indispensable use the emperor Justinian saw with concern that the Persians had occupied by land and sea the monopoly of this important supply and that the wealth of his subjects was continually drained by a nation of enemies and idolaters An active government would have restored the trade of Egypt and the navigation of the Red Sea which had decayed with the prosperity of the empire and the Roman vessels might have sailed for the purchase of silk to the ports of Ceylon of Malacca or even of China Justinian embraced a more humble expedient and solicited the aid of his

disappointment till his wishes were gratified by an unexpected event The gospel had been preached to the Indians a bishop already governed the Christians of St Tho mas on the pepper coast of Malabar a church was planted in Ceylon and the missionaries pursued the footsteps of commerce to the extremities of Asia 2 Two Persian monks had long resided in China perhaps in the royal city of Nan kin the seat of a monarch addicted to foreign superstitions and who actually re ceived an embassy from the isle of Ceylon Amidst their pious occupations they viewed with a curious eye the common dress of the Chinese the manufactures of silk and the myriads of silk worms whose education either on trees or in houses had once been considered as the labour of queens 3 They soon discovered that it was impracticable to transport the short lived insect but that in the eggs a nume rous progeny might be preserved and multiplied in a distant climate Religion or interest had more power over the Persian monks than the love of their country after a long journey they arrived at Constantinople imparted their project to the emperor and were liberally encouraged by the gifts and promises of Justinian To the historians of that prince a campaign at the foot of Mount Caucasus has seemed more deserving of a minute relation than the labours of these missionaries of commerce who again entered China deceived a jealous people by concealing the eggs of the silk worm in a hollow cane and returned in triumph with the spoils of the east Under their direction the eggs were hatched at the proper season by the artificial heat of dung the worms were fed with mulberry leaves they lived and laboured in a foreign climate a sufficient number of butterflies were saved to propagate the race and trees were planted to supply the nourish ment of the rising generations Experience and reflection corrected the errors of a new attempt and the Sogdoite ambassadors acknowledged in the succeeding reign that the Romans were not inferior to the natives of China in the education of the insects and the manufactures of silk 4 in which both China and Constan tinople have been surpassed by the industry of modern Europe I am not insen ble of the benefits of elegant luxury yet I reflect with some pain that if the im porters of silk had introduced the art of printing already practised by the Chi nese the comedies of Menander and the entire decads of Livy would have been perpetuated in the editions of the sixth century A larger view of the globe might at least have promoted the improvement of speculative science but the Chris tian geography was forcibly extracted from texts of Scripture and the study of nature was the surest symptom of an unbelieving mind The orthodox faith con fined the habitable world to one temperate zone and represented the earth as an oblong surface four hundred days journey in length two hundred in breadth encompassed by the ocean and covered by the solid crystal of the firma ment 5 IV The subjects of Justinian were dissatisfied with the times and with the go vernment Europe was overran by the barbarians and Asia by the monks the poverty of the west

immense treasure while he delivered his people from the most odious or oppressive taxes Their gratitude universally applauded the abolition of the g old of affliction a per sonal tribute on the industry of the poor l but more tolerable as it should seem in the form than in the substance since the flourishing city of Edessa paid only one hundred and forty pounds of gold which was collected in four years from ten thou sand artificers 2 Yet such was the parsimony which supported this liberal dis position that in a reign of twenty seven years Anastasius saved from his annual revenue the enormous sum of thirteen millions sterling or three hundred and twenty thousand pounds of gold 3 His example was neglected and his treasure was abused by the nephew of Justin The riches of Justinian were speedily ex hausted by alms and buildings by ambitious wars and ignominious treaties His revenues were found inadequate to his expenses Every art was tried to extort from the people the gold and silver which he scattered with a lavish hand from Persia to France 4 his reign was marked by the vicissitudes or rather by the combat of rapaciousness and avarice of splendour and poverty he lived with the reputation of hidden treasures 5 and bequeathed to his successor the payment of his debts 6 Such a character has been justly accused by the voice of the people and of posterity but public discontent is credulous private malice is bold and a lover of truth will peruse with a suspicious eye the instructive anecdotes of Proco pius The secret historian represents only the vices of Justinian and those vices are darkened by his malevolent pencil Ambiguous actions are imputed to the worst motives error is confounded with guilt accident with design and laws with abuses the partial injustice of a moment is dexterously applied as the general maxim of a reign of thirty two years the emperor alone is made responsible for the faults of his officers trie disorders of the times and the corruption of his sub jects and even the calamities of nature plagues earthquakes and inundations are imputed to the prince of the demons who had mischievously assumed the form of Justinian 7 After this precaution I shall briefly relate the anecdotes of avarice and rapine under the following heads â I Justinian was so profuse that he could not be libe ral The civil and military officers when they were admitted into the service of the palace obtained an humble rank and a moderate stipend they ascended by seniority to a station of affluence and repose the annual pensions of which the most honourable class was abolished by Justinian amounted to four hun dred thousand pounds and this domestic economy was deplored by the venal or indigent courtiers as the last outrage on the majesty of the empire The posts the salaries of physicians and the nocturnal illuminations were objects of more general concern and the cities might justly complain that he usurped the munici pal revenues which hud been appropriated to these useful institutions Even the soldiers were injured and such was the decay of military spirit that they were injured with impunity The emperor refused at the return of each fifth year the customary donative of five pieces of gold reduced his veterans to beg their bread and suffered unpaid armies to melt away in the wars of Italy and Persia II The humanity of his predecessors had always remitted in some auspicious cir cumstance of their reign the arrears of their public tribute and they dexterous ly assumed the merit of resigning those claims which it was impracticable to en force  Justinian in the space of thirty two years has never granted a similar 1 Evagrtni lib iii c 39 40 is minute and grateful but angry with Zosimus for calumniating the great

insufficient to satisfy the demands of the treasury To the cities which had suffered by hostile inroads Anastasius promised a general exemption of seven years the provinces of Justinian have been ravaged by the Persians and Arabs the Huns and Sclavonians but his vain and ridiculous dispensation of a single year has been confined to those places which were actually taken by the enemy Such is the language of the secret historian who expressly denies that any indulgence was granted to Palestine after the revolt of the Samaritans a false and odious charge confuted by the authentic record which attests a relief of thirteen centenaries of gold 52 000 obtained for that desolate province by the intercession of St Sabas l III Procopius has not condescended to explain the system of taxation which fell like a hail storm upon the land like a devouring pestilence on its inhabitants but we should become the accomplices of his malig nity if we imputed to Justinian alone the ancient though rigorous principle that a whole district should be condemned to sustain the partial loss of the persons or property of individuals The Anona or supply of corn for the use of the army and capital was a grievous and arbritrary exaction which exceeded perhaps in a tenfold proportion the ability of the farmer and his distress was aggravated by the partial injustice of weights and measures and the expense and labour of dis tant carriage In a time of scarcity an extraordinary requisition was made to the adjacent provinces of Thrace Bithynia and Phrygia but the proprietors after a wearisome journey and a perilous navigation received so inadequate a compensa tion that they would have chosen the alternative of delivering both the corn and price at the doors of their granaries These precautions might indicate a tender solicitude for the welfare of the capital yet Constantinople did not escape the rapacious despotism of Justinian Till his reign the straits of the Bosphorus and Hellespont were open to the freedom of trade and nothing was prohibited except the exportation of arms for the service of the barbarians At each of these gates of the city a pretor was stationed the minister of imperial avarice heavy customs were imposed on the vessels and their merchandise the oppression was retaliated on the helpless consumer the poor were afflicted by the artificial scarcity and ex orbitant price of the market and a people accustomed to depend on the liberality of their prince might sometimes complain of the deficiency of water and bread 2j The aerial tribute without a name a law or a definite object was an annual gift of 120 000 which the emperor accepted from his pretorian prefect and the means of payment were abandoned to the discretion of that powerful magistrate IV Even such a tax was less intolerable than the privilege of monopolies which checked the fair competition of industry and for the sake of a small and dishonest gain imposed an arbitrary burden on the wants and luxury of the subject  As soon 1 transcribe the anecdotes  as the exclusive sale of silk was usurped by the imperial treasurer a whole people the manufacturers of Tyre and Berytus was reduced to extreme misery and either perished with hunger or fled to the hostile dominions of Persia A province might suffer by the decay of its manu factures but in this example of silk Procopius has partially overlooked the inesti mable and lasting benefit which the empire received from the curiosity of Justi nian His addition of one seventh to the ordinary price of copper money may be interpreted with the same candour and the alteration which might be wise ap pears to have been innocent since he neither alloyed the purity nor enhanced the value of the gold coin 3 the legal measure of public and private payments V The ample jurisdiction required by the farmers of the revenue to accomplish their engagements might be placed in an odious light as if they had purchased from the emperor the lives and fortunes of their fellow citizens And a more di  rect sale of honours and offices was transacted in the palace with the permission or at least with the connivance of Justinian and Theodora The claims of merit even those of favour were disregarded and it was almost reasonable to expect â that the bold adventurer who had undertaken the trade of a magistrate should

Inquiry into the Wealth of Nations vol i p 490 For Justinian s gold coin see Eyngrius lib iv c 30 20 THE DECLINE AND FALL tracted and the heavy interest which he paid A sense of the disgrace and mis chief of this venal practice at length awakened the slumbering virtue of Justinian j and he attempted by the sanction of oaths l and penalties to guard the integrity of his government but at the end of a year of perjury his rigorous edict was sus pended and corruption licentiously abused her triumph over the importance of the laws VI The testament of Eulalius count of the domestics declared the empe ror his sole heir on condition however that he should discharge his debts and le gacies allow to his three daughters a decent maintenance and bestow each of them in marriage with a portion of ten pounds of gold But the splendid fortune of Eu lalius had been consumed by fire and the inventory of his goods did not exceed the trifling sum of five hundred and sixty four pieces of gold A similar instance in Grecian history admonished the emperor of the honourable part prescribed for his imitation He checked the selfish murmurs of the treasury applauded the confidence of his friend discharged the legacies and debts educated the three vir gins under the eye of the empress Theodora and doubled the marriage portion which had satisfied the tenderness of their father 2 The humanity of a prince for princes cannot be generous is entitled to some praise yet even in this act of virtue we may discover the inveterate custom of supplanting the legal or natural heirs which Procopius imputes to the reign of Justinian His charge is supported by eminent names and scandalous examples neither widows nor orphans were spared and the art of soliciting or extorting or supposing testaments was benefi cially practised by the agents of the palace This base and mischievous tyranny invades the security of private life and the monarch who has indulged an appe tite for gain will soon be tempted to anticipate the moment of succession to inter pret wealth as an evidence of guilt and to proceed from the claim of inheritance to the power of confiscation VII Among the forms of rapine a philosopher may be permitted to name the conversion of pagan or heretical riches to the use of the faithful but in the time of Justinian this holy plunder was condemned by the sec taries alone who became the victims of his orthodox avarice 3 Dishonour might be ultimately reflected on the character of Justinian but touch of the guilt and still more of the profit was intercepted by the ministers who were seldom promoted for their virtues and not ahvavs selected for their ta lents 4 The merits of Tribonian the questor will hereafter be weighed in the reformation of the Roman law but the economy of the east was subordinate to the pretorian prefect and Procopius has justified his anecdotes by the portrait â which he exposes in his public history of the notorious vices of John of Cappa docia 5 His knowledge was not borrowed from the schools 6 and his style was scarcely legible but he excelled in the powers of native genius to suggest the wisest counsels and to find expedients in the most desperate situations The corruption of his heart was equal to the vigour of his understanding Although he was suspected of magic and pagan superstition he appeared insensible to the fear of God or the reproaches of man and his aspiring fortune was raised on the death of thousands the poverty of millions the ruin of cities and the desolation of provinces From the dawn of light to the moment of dinner he assiduously laboured to enrich his master and himself at the expense of the Roman world the remainder of the day was spent in sensual and obscene pleasures and the si lent hours of the night were interrupted by the perpetual dread of the justice of an assassin His abilities perhaps his vices recommended him to the lasting friendship of Justinian the emperor yielded with reluctance to the fury of the people his victory was displayed by the immediate restoration of their enemy and they felt above ten years under his oppressive administration that he was stimulated by revenge rather than instructed by misfortune Their murmurs served only to fortify the resolution of Justinian but the prefect in the insolence of favour provoked the resentment of Theodora disdained a power before which

discord between the em peror and his beloved consort Even Theodora herself was constrained to dis semble to wait a favourable moment and by an artful conspiracy to render John of Cappadocia the accomplice of his own destruction At a time when Belisa rius unless he had been a hero must have shown himself a rebel his wife Anto nina who enjoyed the secret confidence of the empress communicated his feigned discontent to Euphemia the daughter of the prefect the credulous virgin im parted to her father the dangerous project and John who might have known the value of oaths and promises was tempted to accept a nocturnal and almost trea sonable interview with the wife of Belisarius An ambuscade of guards and eu nuchs had been posted by the command of Theodora they rushed with drawn swords to seize or punish the guilty minister he was saved by the fidelity of his attendants but instead of appealing to a gracious sovereign who had privately warned him of his danger he pusillanimously fled to the sanctuary of the church The favourite of Justinian was sacrificed to conjugal tenderness or domestic tran quillity the conversion of a prefect into a priest extinguished his ambitious hopes but the friendship of the emperor alleviated his disgrace and he retained in the mild exile of Cyzicus an ample portion of his riches Such imperfect revenge could not satisfy the unrelenting hatred of Theodora the murder of his old ene my the bishop of Cyzicus afforded a decent pretence and John of Cappadocia whose actions had deserved a thousand deaths was at last condemned for a crime of which he was innocent A great minister who had been invested with the ho nours of consul and patrician was ignominiously scourged like the vilest of male factors a tattered cloak was the sole remnant of his fortunes he was transported in a bark to the place of his banishment at Antinopolis in Upper Egypt and the prefect of the east begged his bread through the cities which had trembled at his name During an exile of seven years his life was protected and threatened by the ingenious cruelty of Theodora and when her death permitted the emperor to recall a servant whom he had abandoned with regret the ambition of John of Cappadocia was reduced to the humble duties of the sacerdotal profession His successors convinced the subjects of Justinian that the arts of oppression might still be improved by experience and industry the frauds of a Syrian banker were introduced into the administration of the finances and the example of the prefect was diligently copied by the questor the public and private treasurer the go vernors of provinces and the principal magistrates of the eastern empire 1 V The edifices of Justinian were cemented with the blood and treasure of his people but those stately structures appeared to announce the prosperity of the empire and actually displayed the skill of their architects Both the theoiy and practice of the arts which depend on mathematical science and mechanical power were cultivated under the patronage of the emperors the fame of Archimedes was rivalled by Proclus and Anthemius and if their miracles had been related by in telligent spectators they might now enlarge the speculations instead of exciting the distrust of philosophers A tradition has prevailed that the Roman fleet was reduced to ashes in the port of Syracuse by the burning glasses of Archimedes 2 and it is asserted that a similar expedient was employed by Proclus to destroy the Gothic vessels in the harbour of Constantinople and to protect his benefactor Anastasius against the bold enterprise of Vitalian 3 A machine was fixed on the walls of the city consisting of a hexagon mirror of polished brass with many smaller and moveable polygons to receive and reflect the rays of the meridian sun and a consuming flame was darted to the distance perhaps of two hundred feet 4 The truth of these two extraordinary facts is invalidated by the silence of the most authentic historians and the use of burning glasses was never adopt ed in the attack or defence of places 5 Yet the admirable experiments of a 1 The chronology of Procopius is loose and obscure

philosopher l have demonstrated the possibility of such a mirror and since it is possible I am more disposed to attribute the art to the greatest mathe maticians of antiquity than to give the merit of the fiction to the idle fancy of a monk or a sophist According to another story Proclus applied sulphur to the destruction of the Gothic fleet 2 in a modern imagination the name of sulphur is instantly connected with the suspicion of gunpowder and that suspicion is pro pagated by the secret arts of his disciple Anthemius 3 A citizen of Tralles in Asia had five sons who were all distinguished in their respective professions by merit and success Olympius excelled in the knowledge and practice of the Ro man jurisprudence Diosconjs and Alexander became learned physicians but the skill of the former was exercised for the benefit of his fellow citizens while his more ambitious brothers acquired wealth and reputation at Rome The fame of Metrodorus the grammarian and of Anthemius the mathematician and archi tect reached the ears of the emperor Justinian who invited them to Constantino ple and while the one instructed the rising generation in the schools of eloquence the other filled the capital and provinces with more lasting monuments of his art In a trifling dispute relative to the walls or windows of their contiguous hpuses he had been vanquished by the eloquence of his neighbour Zeno but the orator was defeated in his turn by the master of mechanics whose malicious though harmless stratagems are darkly represented by the ignorance of Aga thias In a lower room Anthemius arranged several vessels or cauldrons of wa ter each of them covered by the wide bottom of a leathern tube which rose to a narrow top and was artificially conveyed among the joists and rafters of the adjacent building A fire was kindled beneath the cauldron the steam of the boiling water ascended through the tubes the house was shaken by the efforts of imprisoned air and its trembling inhabitants might wonder that the city was un conscious of the earthquake which they had felt At another time the friends of Zeno as they sat at table were dazzled by the intolerable light which flashed in their eyes from the reflecting mirrors of Anthemius they were astonished by the noise which he produced from a collision of certain minute and sonorous par ticles and the orator declared in tragic style to the senate that a mere mortal must yield to the power of an antagonist who shook the earth with the trident of Neptune and imitated the thunder and lightning of Jove himself â The genius of Anthemius and his colleague Isidore the Milesian was excited and employed by a prince whose taste for architecture had degenerated into a mischievous and costly passion His favourite architects submitted their designs and difficulties to Justinian and discreetly confessed how much their laborious meditation were surpassed by the intuitive knowledge or celestial inspiration of an emperor whose views were always directed to the benefit of his people the glory of his reign and the salvation of his soul 4 The principal church which was dedicated by the founder of Constantinople to St Sophia or the eternal Wisdom had been twice destroyed by fire after the exile of John Chrysostom and during the Nika of the blue and green factions No sooner did the tumult

silver was never delayed beyond the evening The emperorhimself clad in a li nen tunic surveyed each day their rapid progress and encouraged their diligence by his familiarity his zeal and his rewards The new cathedral of St Sophia was consecrated by the patriarch five years eleven months and ten days from the first foundation and in the midst of the solemn festival Justinian exclaimed with devout vanity  Glory be to God who hath thought me worthy to accomplish so great a work I have vanquished thee O Solomon l But the pride of the Ro man Solomon before twenty years had elapsed was humbled by an earthquake â which overthrew the eastern part of the dome Its splendour was again restored by the perseverance of the same prince and in the thirty sixth year of his reign Justinian celebrated the second dedication of a temple which remains after twelve centuries a stately monument of his fame The architecture of St Sophia which is now converted into the principal mosch has been imitated by the Turk ish sultans and that venerable pile continues to excite the fond admiration of the Greeks and the more rational curiosity of European travellers The eye of the spectator is disappointed by an irregular prospect of half domes and shelving roofs the western front the principal approach is destitute of simplicity and magnificence and the scale of dimensions has been much surpassed by several of the Latin cathedrals But the architect who first erected an aerial cupola is en titled to the praise of bold design and skilful execution The dome of St Sophia illuminated by four and twenty windows is formed with so small a curve that the depth is equal only to one sixth of its diameter the measure of that diameter is one hundred and fifteen feet and the lofty centre where a crescent has supplant ed the cross rises to the perpendicular height of one hundred and eighty feet above the pavement The circle which encompasses the dome lightly reposes on four strong arches and their weight is firmly supported by four massy piles whose strength is assisted on the northern and southern sides by four columns of Egyp tian granite A Greek cross inscribed in a quadrangle represents the form of the edifice the exact breadth is two hundred and forty three feet and two hun dred and sixty nine may be assigned for the extreme length from the sanctuary in the east to the nine western doors which open in the vestibule and from thence into the narthex or exterior portico That portico was the humble station of the penitents The nave or body of the church was filled by the congregation of the faithful but the two sexes were prudently distinguished and the upper and lower galleries were allotted for the more private devotion of the women Beyond the northern and southern piles a balustrade terminated on either side by the thrones of the emperor and the patriarch divided the nave from the choir and the space as far as the steps of the altar was occupied by the clergy and singers The al tar itself a name which insensibly became familiar to Christian ears was placed in the eastern recess artificially built in the form of a demi cylinder and this sanctuary communicated by several doors with the sacristy the vestry the bap tistery and the contiguous buildings subservient either to the pomp of worship or the private use of the ecclesiastical ministers The memory of past calamities  inspired Justinian with a wise resolution that no wood except for the doors should be admitted into the new edifice and the choice of the materials was ap plied to the strength the lightness or the splendour of the respective parts The solid piles which sustained the cupola were composed of huge blocks of freestone hewn into squares and triangles fortified by circles of iron and firmly cemented by the infusion of lead and quick lime but the weight of the cupola was diminished by the levity of its substance which consists either of pumice stone that floats in the water or of bricks from the isle of Rhodes five times less ponderous than the ordinary sort The whole frame of the edifice was construct ed of brick but those base materials were concealed by a crust of marble and the inside of St Sophia the cupola the two larger and the six smaller semi domes the walls the hundred columns and the pavement delight even the eyes of barbarians with a rich and variegated

nature had profusely di versified and which were blended and contrasted as it were by a skilful painter The triumph of Christ was adorned with the last spoils of Paganism but the greater part of these costly stones was extracted from the quarries of Asia Minor the isles and continent of Greece Egypt Africa and Gaul Eight columns of porphyry which Aurelian had placed in the temple of the sun were offered by the piety of a Roman matron eight others of green marble were presented by the ambitious zeal of the magistrates of Ephesus both are admirable by their size and beauty but every order of architecture disclaims their fantastic capitals A variety of ornaments and figures was curiously expressed in mosaic and the images of Christ of the Virgin of saints and of angels which have been defaced by Turkish fanaticism were dangerously exposed to the superstition of the Greeks According to the sanctity of each object the precious metals were distributed in thin leaves or in solid masses The balustrade of the choir the capitals of the pillars the ornaments of the doors and galleries were of gilt bronze the spec tator was dazzled by the glittering aspect of the cupola the sanctuary contained forty thousand pound weight of silver and the holy vases and vestments of the altar were of the purest gold enriched with inestimable gems Before the struc ture of the church had risen two cubits above the ground 45 2001 were already consumed and the whole expense amounted to 320 000 each reader according to the measure of his belief may estimate their value either in gold or silver but the sum of 1 000 000 sterling is the result of the lowest computation A magni ficent temple is a laudable monument of national taste and religion and the en thusiast who entered the dome of St Sophia might be tempted to suppose that it was the residence or even the workmanship of the Deity Yet how dull is the artifice how insignificant is the labour if it be compared with the formation of the vilest insect that crawls upon the surface of the temple So minute a description of an edifice which time has respected may attest the truth and excuse the relation of the innumerable works both in the capital and provinces which Justinian constructed on a smaller scale and less durable founda tions 1 In Constantinople alone and the adjacent suburbs he dedicated twenty five churches to the honour of Christ the Virgin and the saints most of these churches were decorated with marble and gold and their various situation was skilfully chosen in a populous square or a pleasant grove on the margin of the sea shore or on some lofty eminence which overlooked the continents of Europe and Asia The church of the holy apostles at Constantinople and that of St John at Ephesus appear to have been framed on the same model their domes aspired to imitate the cupolas of St Sophia but the altar was more judiciously placed un der the centre of the dome at the junction of four stately porticos which more ac curately expressed the figure of the Greek cross The virgin of Jerusalem might exult in the temple erected by her imperial votary on a most ungrateful spot which afforded neither ground nor materials to the architect A level was formed by laising part of a deep valley to the height of a mountain The stones of a neigh bouring quarry were hewn into regular forms each block was fixed on a peculiar carriage drawn by forty of the strongest oxen and the roads were widened for the passage of such enormous weights Lebanon furnished her loftiest cedars for the timbers of the church and the seasonable discovery of a vein of red marble sup plied its beautiful columns two of which the supporters of the exterior portico were esteemed the largest in the world The pious munificence of the emperor was diffused over the holy land and if reason should condemn the monasteries of both sexes which were built or restored by Justinian yet charity must applaud the wells which he sunk and the hospitals which he founded for the relief of the wea ry pilgrims The schismatical temper of Egypt was ill entitled to the royal boun ty but in Syria and Africa some remedies were applied to the

obtain ed the solid advantages of bridges hospitals and aqueducts but the severe libe rality of the monarch disdained to indulge his subjects in the popular luxury of baths and theatres While Justinian laboured for the public service he was not unmindful of his own dignity and ease The Byzantine palace which had been damaged by the conflagration was restored with new magnificence and some no tions may be conceived of the whole edifice by the vestibule or hall which from the doors perhaps or the roof was surnamed choice or the brazen The dome of a spacious quadrangle was supported by massy pillars the pavement and walls were incrusted with many coloured marblesâ the emerald green of Laconia the fiery red and the white Phrygian stone intersected with veins of a sea green hue the Mosaic paintings of the dome and sides represented the glories of the African and Italian triumphs On the Asiatic shore of the Propontis at a small distance to the east of Chalcedon the costly palace and gardens of Herxum 2 were pre pared for the summer residence of Justinian and more especially Theodora The poets of the age have celebrated the rare alliance of nature and art the harmony of the nymphs of the groves the fountains and the waves yet the crowd of at tendants who followed the court complained of their inconvenient lodgings 3 and the nymphs were too often alarmed by the famous Porphyrio a whale of ten cu bits in breadth and thirty in length who was stranded at the mouth of the river Sangaris after he had infested more than half a century the seas of Constantino The fortifications of Europe and Asia were multiplied by Justinian but the repe tition of those timid and fruitless precautions exposes to a philosophic eye the de bility of the empire 5 From Belgrade to the Euxine from the conflux of the Save to the mouth of the Danube a chain of above fourscore fortified places was extended along the banks of the great river Single watch towers were changed into spacious citadels vacant walls which the engineers contracted or enlarged according to the nature of the ground were filled with colonies or garrisons a strong fortress defended the ruins of Trajan s bridge 6 and several military sta tions affected to spread beyond the Danube the pride of the Roman name But that name was divested of its terrors the barbarians in their annual inroads passed and contemptuously repassed before these useless bulwarks and the inhabitants of the frontiers instead of reposing under the shadow of the general defence were compelled to guard with incessant vigilance their separate habitations The soli tude of ancient cities was replenished the new foundations of Justinian acquired perhaps too hastily the epithets of impregnable and populous and the auspicious place of his own nativity attracted the grateful reverence of the vainest of princes Under the name of Justiniana flrima the obscure village of Tauresium oecame the seat of an archbishop and a prefect

aqueduct were speedily constructed the public and private edifices were adapt ed to the greatness of a royal city and the strength of the walls resisted during the lifetime of Justinian the unskilful assaults of the Huns and Sclavonians Their progress was sometimes retarded and their hopes of rapine were disappointed by the innumerable castles which in the provinces of Dacia Epirus Thessaly Ma cedonia and Thrace Appeared to cover the whole face of the country Six hun dred of these forts were built or repaired by the emperor but it seems reasonable to believe that the far greater part consisted only of a stone or brick tower in the midst of a square or circular area which was surrounded by a wall and ditch and afforded in a moment of danger some protection o the peasants and cattle of the neighbouring villages l Yet these military works which exhausted the public treasure could not remove the just apprehensions of Justinian and his European subjects The warm baths of Anchialus in Thrace were rendered as safe as they were salutary but the rich pastures of Thessalonica were foraged by the Scythian cavalry the delicious vale of Tempe three hundred miles from the Danube was continually alarmed by the sound of war 2 and no unfortified spot however dis tant or solitary could securely enjoy the blessings of peace The straits of Ther mopylae which seemed to protect but which had so often betrayed the safety of Greece were diligently strengthened by the labours of Justinian From the edge of the sea shore through theforest and valleys and as far as the summit of the Thessalian mountains a strong wall was continued which occupied every practi cable entrance Instead of a hasty crowd of peasants a garrison of two thousand soldiers was stationed along the rampart granaries of corn and reservoirs of wa ter were provided for their use and by a precaution that inspired the cowardice which it foresaw convenient fortresses were erected for their retreat The walls of Corinth overthrown by an earthquake and the mouldering bulwarks of Athens and Platxa were carefully restored the barbarians were discouraged by the pros pect of successive and painful sieges and the naked cities of Peloponnesus were covered by the fortifications of the isthmus of Corinth At the extremity of Eu rope another peninsula the Thracian Chersonesus runs three days journey into the sea to form with the adjacent shores of Asia the straits of the Hellespont The intervals between eleven populous towns were filled by lofty woods fair pas tures and arable lands and the isthmus or thirty seven stadia or furlongs had been fortified by a Spartan general nine hundred years before the reign of Justi nian 3 In an age of freedom and valour the slightest rampart may prevent a surprise and Procopius appears insensible of the superiority of ancient times while he praises the solid construction and double parapet of a wall whose long arms stretched on either side into the sea but whose strength was deemed insufficient to guard the Chersonesus if each city and particularly Gallipoli and Sestus had not been secured by their peculiar fortifications The long wall as it was em phatically styled was a work as disgraceful in the object as it was respectable in the execution The riches of a capital diffuse themselves over the neighbouring country and the territory of Constantinople a paradise of nature was adorned â with the luxurious gardens and villas of the senators and opulent citizens But their wealth served only to attract the bold and rapacious barbarians the noblest of the Romans in the bosom of peaceful indolence were led away into Scythian captivity and their sovereign might view from his palace the hostile flames which were insolently spread to the gates of the imperial city At the distance only of forty miles Anastasius was constrained to establish a last frontier his long wall of sixty miles from the Propontis to the Euxine proclaimed the impotence of his arms and as the danger became more imminent new fortifications were added by the indefatigable prudence of Justinian 4 Asia Minor after the submission of the Isaurians 5 remained without enemies and without fortifications Those bold savages who had disdained to be the sub jects of Galenius persisted two hundred and thirty years in a life of independence â 1 These

strength of the mountains and the despair of the natives their fierce spirit was sometimes toothed with gifts and sometimes restrained by terror and a military count with three legions fixed his permanent and ignominious station in the heart of the Roman provinces 1J But no sooner was the vigilance of power relaxed or diverted than the light armed squadrons descended from the hills and invaded the peaceful plenty of Asia Al though the Isaurians were not remarkable for stature or bravery want rendered them bold and experience made them skilful in the exercise of predatory war They advanced with secrecy and speed to the attack of villages and defenceless towns their flying parties have sometimes touched the Hellespont the Euxine and the gates of Tarsus Antioch or Damascus 2 and the spoil was lodged in their inaccessi ble mountains before the Roman troops had received their orders or the distant pro vince had computed its loss The guilt of rebellion and robbery excluded them from the rights of national enemies and the magistrates were instructed by an edict that the trial or punishment of an Isaurian even on the festival of Easter was a meritorious act of justice and piety 3 If the captives were condemned to domes tic slavery they maintained with their sword or dagger the private quarrel of their masters and it was found expedient for the public tranquillity to prohibit the ser vice of such dangerous retainers When their countryman I arcalissseus or Zeno ascended the throne he invited a faithful and formidable band of Isaurians who in sulted the court and city and were rewarded by an annual tribute of five thousand pounds of gold But the hopes of fortune depopulated the mountains luxury ener vated the hardiness of their minds and bodies and in proportion as they mixed with mankind they became less qualified for the enjoyment of poor and solitary free dom After the death of Zeno his successor Anastasius suppressed their pensions exposed their persons to the revenge of the people banished them from Constanti nople and prepared to sustain a war which left only the alternative of victory or servitude A brother of the last emperor usurped the title of Augustus his cause was powerfully supported by the arms the treasures and the magazines collected by Zeno and the native Isaurians must have formed the smallest portion of the hundred and fifty thousand barbarians under his standard which was sanctified for the first time by the presence of a fighting bishop Their disorderly numbers were vanquished in the plains of Phrygia by the valour and discipline of the Goths but a war of six years almost exhausted the courage of the emperor 4 The Isau rians retired to their mountains their fortresses were successively besieged and ruined their communication with the sea was intercepted the bravest of their lead ers died in arms the surviving chiefs before their execution were dragged in chains through the hippodrome a colony of their youth was transplanted into Thrace and the remnant of the people submitted to the Roman government Yet some generations elapsed before their minds were reduced to the level of slavery The populous villages of mount Tauris were filled with horsemen and archers they resisted the imposition of tributes but they recruited the armies of Justinian and his cwilmagistrates the proconsul of Cappadocia the count of Isauria and the prsetor of Lycaonia and Pisidia were invested with military power to restrain the licentious practice of rapes and assassinations 5 If we extend our view from the tropic to the mouth of the Tanais we may ob serve on one hand the precautions of Justinian to curb the savages of Ethiopia 6 and on the other the long walls which he constructed in Crimea for the

their name and temper from the iron quality of the soil and since the days of Cyrus they might produce under the various appellations of Chaldeans and Zanians an uninten upted prescription of war and rapine Under the reign of Justinian they acknowledged the God and the emperor of the Romans and seven fortresses were built in the most accessible passes to exclude the am bition of the Persian monarch 4 The principal source of the Euphrates descends from the Chalybian mountains and seems to flow towards the west and the Eux ine bending to the south west the river passes under the walls of Satala and Me litene which were restored by Justinian as the bulwarks of the Lesser Armenia and gradually approaches the Mediterranean sea till at length repelled by mount Taurus 5 the Euphrates

the relics of the martyrs and two capitals Amida and Edessa which are celebrated in the histo rv of every age Their strength was proportioned by Justinian to the danger of their situation A ditch and palisade might be sufficient to resist the artless force of the cavalry of Scythia but more elaborate works were required to sustain a re gular siege against the arms and treasures of the great king His skilful engineers understood the methods of conducting deep mines and of raising platforms to the level of the rampart he shook the strongest battlements with his military engines and sometimes advanced to the assault with aline of moveable turrets on the backs of elephants In the great cities of the east the disadvantage of space perhaps of position was compensated by the zeal of the people who seconded the garrison in the defence of their country and religion and the fabulous promise of the son of God that Edessa should never be taken filled the citizens with violent confidence and chilled the besiegers with doubt and dismay 6 The subordinate towns of Armenia and Mesopotamia were diligently strengthened and the posts which ap peared to have any command of ground or water were occupied by numerous forts substantially built of stone or more hastily erected with the obvious materi als of earth and brick The eye of Justinian investigated every spot and his cru el precautions

robbers and in the proud security of peace the fortifications of Syria were neglected on the most vulnerable side But the national enmity at least the effects of that enmity had been suspended by a truce which continued above forescore years An ambassador from the em peror Zeno accompanied the rash and unfortunate Perozes in his expedition against the Nepthalites or White Huns whose conquest had been stretched from the Caspian to the heart of India whose throne was enriched with emeralds l and whose cavalry was supported by a line of two thousand elephants 2 The Persians were twice circumvented in a situation which made valour useless and flight impossible and the double victory of the Huns was achieved by military stratagem They dismissed their royal captive after he had submitted to adore the majesty of a barbarian and the humiliation was poorly evaded by the casnis tical subtilty of the Magi who instructed Perozes to direct his attention to the rising sun The indignant successor of Cyrus forgot his danger and his gratitude he renewed the attack with headstrong fury and lost both his army and his life 3 The death of Perozes abandoned Persia to her foreign and domestic enemies and twelve years of confusion elapsed before his son Cabades or Kobad could embrace any designs of ambition or revenge The unkind parsimony of Anastasius was the motive or pretence of a Roman war 4 the Huns and Arabs marched under the Persian standard and the fortifications of Armenia and Mesopotamia were at that time in a ruinous or imperfect condition The emperor returned his thanks to the governor and people of Matyropolis for the prompt surrender of a city which could not be successfully defended and the conflragration of Theodosopolis might justify the conduct of their prudent neighbours Amida sustained a long and destructive siege at the end of three months the loss of fifty thousand of the soldiers of Cabades was not balanced by any prospect of success and it was in vain that the Magi deduced a flattering prediction from the indecency of the wo men on the ramparts who had revealed their most secret charms to the eyes of the assailants At

dawn of day the presence of Cabades his stern command and his drawn sword compelled the Persians to vanquish and before it was sheathed fourscore thousand of the inhabitants had expiated the blood of their companions After the siege of Amida the war continued three years and the unhappy frontier tasted the full measure of its calamities The gold of Anastasius was offered too late the num ber of his troops was defeated by the number of their generals the country was stripped of its inhabitants and both the living and the dead were abandoned to the wild beasts of the desert The resistance of Edessa and the deficiency of spoil inclined the mind of Cabades to peace he sold his conquests for an exorbitant price and the same line though marked with slaughter and devastation still se parated the two empires To avert the repetition of the same evils Anastasius resolved to found a new colony so strong that it should defy the power of the Persian so far advanced towards Assyria that its stationary troops might defend the province by the menace or operation of an offensive war For this purpose the town of Dara 5 fourteen miles from Nisibis and four days journey from the Ti gris was peopled ami adorned the hasty works of Anastasius were improved by the perseverance of Justinian and without insisting on places less important the fortifications of Dara may represent the military

inner wall was a monument of strength and beauty it measured sixty feet from the ground and the height of the towers was one hundred feet the loop holes from whence an enemy might be annoyed with missile weapons were small but numerous the soldiers were planted along the rampart under the shelter of double galleries and a third plat form spacious and secure was raised on the summit of the towers The exteri or wall appears to have been less lofty but more solid and each tower was pro tected by a quadrangular bulwark A hard rocky soil resisted the tools of the mi ners and on the south east where the ground was more tractable their approach was retarded by a new work which advanced in the shape of a half moon The double and treble ditches were filled with a stream of water and in the manage ment of the river the most skilful labour was employed to supply the inhabitants to distress the besiegers and to prevent the mischiefs of a natural or artificial inundation Dara continued more than sixty years to fulfil the wishes of its foun ders and to provoke the jealousy of the Persians who incessantly complained that this impregnable fortress had been constructed in manifest violation of the treaty of peace between the two empires Between the Euxine and the Caspian the countries of Cholchos Iberia and Albania are intersected in every direction by the branches of mount Caucasus and the two principal gates or passes from north to south have been frequently confounded in the geography both of the ancients and moderns The name of Caspian or Albanian gates is properly applied to Derbend l which occupies a short declivity between the mountains and the sea the city if we give credit to local tradition had been founded by the Greeks and this dangerous entrance was fortified by the kings of Persia with a mole double walls and doors of iron The Iberian gates 2 are formed by a narrow passage of six miles in mount Caucasus which opens from the northern side of Iberia or Georgia into the plain that reaches to the Tanais and the Volga A fortress designed by Alexander per haps or one of his successors to command that important pass had descended by right of conquest or inheritance to a prince of the Huns who offered it for a mo derate price to the emperor but while Anastasius paused while he timorously computed the cost and the distance a more vigilant rival interposed and Cabades forcibly occupied the straits of Caucasus The Albanian and Iberian gates ex cluded the horsemen of Scythia from the shortest and most practicable roads and the whole front of the mountain was covered by the rampart of Gog and Magog the long wall which has excited the curiosity of an Arabian caliph 3 and a Rus sian conqueror 4 Accordingto a recent description hugestone seven feet thick twenty one feet in length or height are artificially joined without iron or cement to compose a wall which runs above three hundred miles from the shores of Der bend over the hills and through the valleys of Daghestan and Georgia With out a vision such a work might be undertaken by the policy of Cabades without a miracle it might be accomplished by his son so formidable to the Romans under the name of Chosroes so dear to the orientals under the appellation of Nushirwan The Persian monarch held in his hand the keys both of peace and war but he stipulated in every treaty that Justinian should contribute to the ex pense of a common barrier which equally protected the two empires from the in roads of the Scythians 5 VII Justinian suppressed the schools of Athens and the

nature is ex alted by the simple recollection that Isocrates l was the companion of Plato and Xenophon that he assisted perhaps with the historian Thucydides at the first representations of the CEdipus of Sophocles and the Iphigenia of Euripides and that his pupils jEschines and Demosthenes contended for the crown of patriotism in the presence of Aristotle the master of Theophrastus who taught at Athens with the founders of the Stoic and Epicurean sects 2 The ingenious youth of Attica enjoyed the benefits of their domestic education which was communicated without envy to the rival cities Two thousand disciples heard the lessons of Theophras tus the schools of rhetoric must have been still more populous than those of philosophy and a rapid succession of students diffused the fame of their teachers as far as the utmost limits of the Grecian language and name Those limits were enlarged by the victories of Alexander the arts of Athens survived her freedom and dominion and the Greek colonies which the Macedonians planted in Egypt and scattered over Asia undertook long and frequent pilgrimages to worship the Muses in their favourite temple on the banks of the Ilissus The Latin conquerors respectfully listened to the instructions of their subjects and captives the names of Cicero and Horace were enrolled in the schools of Athens and after the perfect settlement of the Roman empire the natives of Italy of Africa and of Britain con versed in the groves of the academy with their fellow students of the east The studies of philosophy and eloquence are congenial to a popular state which en courages the freedom of inquiry and submits only to the force of persuasion In the republics of Greece and Rome the art of speaking was the powerful engine of patriotism or ambition and the schools of rhetoric poured forth a colony of states men and legislators When the liberty of public debate was suppressed thÂ ora tor in the honourable profession of an advocate might plead the cause of innocence and justice he might abuse his talents in the more profitable trade of panegyric and the same precepts continued to dictate the fanciful declamations of the sophist and the chaster beauties of historical composition The systems which professed to un fold the nature of God of man and of the universe entertained the curiosity of the philosophic student and according to the temper of his mind he might doubt with the sceptics or decide with the Stoics sublimely speculate with Plato or severe ly argue with Aristotle The pride of the adverse sects had fixed an unattainable term of moral happiness and perfection but the race was glorious and salutary the disciples of Zeno and even those of Epicurus were taught both to act and to suffer and the death of Petronius was not less effectual than that of Seneca to humble a tyrant by the discovery of his impotence The light of science could not indeed be confined within the walls of Athens Her incomparable writers address themselves to the human race the living masters emigrated to Italy and Asia Berytus in later times was devoted to the study of the law astronomy and physic were cultivated in the museum of Alexandria but the Attic schools of rhetoric and philosophy maintained their superior reputation from the Peloponne sian war to the reign of Justinian Athens though situated in a barren soil possessed a pure air a free navigation and the monuments of ancient art That sacred retirement was seldom disturbed by business of trade or government and the last of the Athenians were distinguished by their lively wit the purity of their taste and language their social manners and some traces at least in discourse of the magnanimity of their fathers In the suburbs of the city the academy of the Platohists the lyceum of the Peripatetics the wrtico of the Stoics and the garden of the Epicureans were planted with trees and decorated with statues and the philosophers instead of being immured in a cloister delivered their instructions in spacious and pleasant walks which at different hours were consecrated to the exercises of the mind and body The genius of the founders still lived in those venerable seats the ambition of succeeding to the masters of human reason ex cited a generous emulation and the merit of the candidates was determined on each vacancy by the free voices of an enlightened people The Athenian pro fessors were paid by their disciples according to their mutual wants and abilities 1 The life of Isocrates extends from Olymp 86 1 to 110 3 ante Christ 436â 433 Sec

Isocrates himself who derides the avarice of thÂ sophists required in his school of rhetoric about thirty pounds from each of his hundred pupils The wages of industry are just and honourable yet the same Isocrates shed tears at the first receipt of a stipend the Stoic might blush when he was hired to preach the contempt of money and I should be sorry to discover that Aristotle or Plato so far degenerated from the ex ample of Socrates as to exchange knowledge for gold But some property of lands and houses was settled by the permission of the laws and the legacies of the de ceased friends on the philosophic chairs of Athens Epicurus bequeathed to his disciples the gardens which he had purchased for eighty minx or two hundred and fifty pounds with a fund sufficient for their frugal subsistence and monthly fes tivals and the patrimony of Plato afforded an annual rent which in eight cen turies was gradually increased from three to one thousand pieces of gold 2 The schools of Athens were protected by the wisest and most virtuous of the Roman princes The library which Hadrian founded was placed in a portico adorned with pictures statues and a roof of alabaster and supported by one hundred columns of Phrygian marble The public salaries were assigned by the generous spirit of the Antonines and each professor of politics of rhetoric of the Platonic the Peripa tetic the Stoic and the Epicurean philosophy received an annual stipend of ten thousand drachmx or more than three hundred pounds sterling S After the death of Marcus these liberal donations and the privileges attached to the thrones of science were abolished and revived diminished and enlarged but some ves tige of royal bounty may be found under the successors of Constantine and their arbitrary choice of an unworthy candidate might tempt the philosophers of Athens to regret the days of independence and poverty 4 It is remarkable that the impartial favour of the Antonines was bestowed on the four adverse sects of philoso phy which they considered as equally useful or at least as equally innocent So crates had formerly been the glory and the reproach of his country and the first lessons of Epicurus so strangely scandalized the pious ears of the Athenians that by his exile and that of his antagonists they silenced all vain disputes concerning the nature of the gods But in the ensuing year they recalled the hasty decree restored the liberty of the schools and were convinced by the experience of ages that the moral character of philosophers is not affected by the diversity of their theological speculations 5 The Gothic arms were less fatal to the schools of Athens than the establishment of a new religion whose ministers superseded the exercise of reason resolved eve ry question by an article of faith and condemned the infidel or sceptic to eternal flames In many a volume of laborious controversy they exposed the weakness of the understanding and the corruption of the heart insulted human nature in the sages of antiquity and proscribed the spirit of philosophical inquiry so repugnant to the doctrine or at least to the temper of an humble believer The surviving sect of the Platonists whom Plato would have blushed to acknowledge extrava gantly mingled a sublime theory with the practice of superstition and magic and as they remained alone in the midst of a Christian world they indulged a secret rancour against the government of the church and state whose severity was still suspended over their heads About a century after the reign of Julian 6 Pro elus was

with that of his scholar Isidore l compiled by two oÂ their most learned disciples exhibits a deplorable picture of the second childhood of human reason Yet the golden chain as it was fondly styled of the Platonic succession continued forty four years from the death of Proclus to the edict of Justinian 2 â which imposed a perpetual silence on the schools of Athens and excited the grief and indignation of the few remaining votaries of Grecian science and superstition Seven friends and philosophers Diogenes and Hermias Eulalius and Priscian Damascius Isidore and Simplicius who dissented from the religion of their sove reign embraced the resolution of seeking in a foreign land the freedom which was denied in their native country They had heard and they credulously believed that the republic of Plato was realized in the despotic government of Persia and that a patriot king reigned over the happiest and most virtuous of nations They were soon astonished by the natural discovery that Persia resembled the other countries of the globe that Chosroes who affected the name of a philosopher was vain cruel and ambitious that bigotry and a spirit of intolerance prevailed among the Magi that the nobles were haughty the courtiers servile and the magistrates unjust that the guilty sometimes escaped and that the innocent were often op pressed The disappointment of the philosophers provoked them to overlook the real virtues of the Persians and they were scandalized more deeply perhaps than became their profession with the plurality of wives and concubines the incestuous marriages and the custom of exposing dead bodies to the dogs and vultures in stead of hiding them in the earth or consuming them with fire Their repent ance was expressed by a precipitate return and they loudly declared that they had rather die on the borders of the empire than enjoy the wealth and favour of the barbarian From this journey however they derived a benefit which reflects the purest lustre on the character of Chosroes He required that the seven sages who had visited the court of Persia should be exempted from the penal laws which Justinian enacted against his pagan subjects and this privilege expressly stipulated in a treaty of peace was guarded by the vigilance of a powerful mediator 3 Sim plicius and his companions ended their lives in peace and obscurity and as they left no disciples they terminated the long list of Grecian philosophers who may be justly praised notwithstanding their defects as the wisest and most virtuous of their cotemporaries The writings of Simplicius are now extant His physical and metaphysical commentaries on Aristotle have passed away with the fashion of the times but his moral interpretation of Epictetus is preserved in the library of nations as a classic book most excellently adapted to direct the will to purify the heart and confirm the understanding by a just confidence in the nature both of God and man About the same time that Pythagoras first invented the appellation philosopher liberty and the consulship were founded at Rome by the elder Brutus The revo lutions of the consular office which may be viewed in the successive lights of a substance a shadow and a name have been occasionally mentioned in the present history The first magistrates of the republic had been chosen by the people to exercise in the senate and in the camp the powers of peace and war which were afterwards translated to the emperors But the tradition of ancient dignity was long revered by the Romans and barbarians A Gothic historian applauds the consulship of Theodoric as the height of all temporal glory and greatness 4 the king of Italy himself congratulates those annual favourites of fortune who with out the cares

honour which involved the certain ruin of their fami lies and to this reluctance I should impute the frequent chasms in the last age of the consular Fasti The predecessors of Justinian had assisted from the public treasures the dignity of the less opulent candidates the avarice of that prince pre ferred the cheaper and more convenient method of advice and regulation l Se ven processions or spectacles were the number to which his edict confined the horse and chariot races the athletic sports the music and pantomimes of the theatre and the hunting of wild beasts and small pieces of silver were discreetly substi tuted to the gold medals which had always excited tumult and drunkenness when they were scattered with a profuse hand among the populace Notwithstanding these precautions and his own example the succession of consuls finally ceased in the thirteenth year of Justinian whose despotic temper might be gratified by the silent extinction of a title which admonished the Romans of their ancient free dom Yet the annual consulship still lived in the minds of the people they fondly expected its speedy restoration they applauded the gracious condescension of successive princes by whom it was assumed in the first year of their reign and three centuries elapsed after the death of Justinian before that obsolete dignity which had been suppressed by custom could be abolished by law

had been stripped of the imperial purple the princes of Constantinople as sumed the sole and sacred sceptre of the monarchy demanded as their rightful inheritance the provinces which had been subdued by the consuls or possessed by the Caisars and feebly aspired to deliver their faithful subjects of the west from the usuipation of heretics and barbarians The execution of this splendid design was in some degree reserved for Justinian During the five first years of his reign he reluctantly waged a costly and unprofitable war against the Persians till his pride submitted to his ambition and he purchased at the price of 440 000 sterling the benefit of a precarious truce which in the language of both nations was dignified with the appellation of the endless peace The safety of the east enabled the emperor to employ his forces against the Vandals and the internal state of Africa afforded an honourable motive and promised a powerful support to the Roman arms l According to the testament of the founder the African kingdom had lineally descended to Hilderic the eldest of the Vandal princes A mUd disposition in clined the son of a tyrant the grandson of a conqueror to prefer the counsels of clemency and peace and his accession was marked by the salutary edict which restored two hundred bishops to their churches and allowed free profession of the Athanasian creed 2 But the catholics accepted with cold and transient gratitude a favour so inadequate to their pretensions and the virtues of Hilderic offended the prejudices of his countrymen The Arian clergy presumed to in sinuate that he had renounced the faith and the soldiers more loudly complained that he had degenerated from the courage of his ancestors His ambassadors were suspected of a secret and disgraceful negotiation in tie Byzantine court and his general the Achilles 3 as he was named of the VaÂ dals lost a battle against the naked and disorderly Moors The public disconteÂ t was exasperated by Ge limer whose age descent and military fame gave lvm an apparent title to the succession he assumed with the consent of the nation the reigns of govern ment and his unfortunate sovereign sunk without a struggle from the throne to a dungeon where he was striptly guarded with a faithful counsellor and his unpo pular nephew the Achilles of the Vandals But the indulgence which Hilderic had shown to his catholic subjects had powerfully recommended him to the fa vour of Justinian who for the benefit of bis own sect could acknowledge the use and justice of religious toleration their alliance while the nephew of Justin re mained in a private station was cemented by the mutual exchange of gifts and letters and the emperor Justinian asserted the cause of loyalty and friendship In two successive embassies he admonished the usurper to repent of his treason or to abstain at least from anv further violence which might provoke the dis pleasure of God and of the Romans to reverence the laws of kindred and suc cession and to suffer an infirm old man peaceably to end his days either on the throne of Carthage or in the palace of Constantinople The passions or even the prudence of Gelimer compelled him to reject these requests which were urged in the haughty tone of menace and command and he justified his ambition in a language rarely spoken in a Bvzantine court by alleging the right of a free people to remove or punish their chief magistrate who had failed in the execution of the kingly office After this fruitless expostulation the captive monarch was most rigorously treated his nephew was deprived of his eyes and the cruel Vandal confident in his strength and distance derided the vain threats and slow prepara tions of the emperor of the eas Justinian resolved to deliver or

new labours a single misfortune will attract the barbarians into the heart of your exhausted empire Justinian felt the weight of this salutary advice he was confounded by the unwonted freedom of an obsequious servant and the de sign of the war would perhaps have been relinquished if his courage had not been revived by a voice which silenced the doubts of profane reason  I have seen a vision cried m artful or fanatic bishop of the east It is the will of Heaven O emperor f at you Should not abandon your holy enterprise for the de liverance of the African church The god of battles will inarch before your standard and disperse ymr enemies who are the enemies of his Son The emperor might be tempted and his counsellors were constrained to give credit to this seasonable revelation but they derived more rational hope from the re volt which the adherents of Hilderic or Athanasius had already excited on the borders of the Vandal monarchy Prudentius an African subject had privately signified his royal intentions and a small military am restored the province of Tripoli to the obedience of the Romans The government of Sardinia had been intrusted to Godas a valiant barbarian he suspended the payment of tribute dis claimed his allegiance to the usurper and gave audience to the emissaries of Jus tinian who found him master of that fruitful island at the head of his guards and proudly invested with the ensigns of royalty The forces of the Vandals were diminished by discord and suspicion the Roman armies were animated by the spirit of Belisarius one of those heroic names which are familiar to every age and to every nation The Africanus of new Rome was born and perhaps educated among the Thra cian peasants 2 without any of those advantages which had formed the virtues of the elder and the younger Scipio a noble origin liberal studies and the emulation of a free state The silence ot a loquacious secretary may be admitted to prove that the youth of Belisarius could not afford any subject of praise he served most as suredly with valour and reputation among the private guards of Justinian and when his patron became emperor the domestic was promoted to military com mand After a bold inroad into Persarmenia in which his glory was shared by a colleague and his progress was checked by an enemy Belisarius repaired to the important station of Dara where he first accepted the service of Procopius the faithful companion and diligent historian of his exploits 3 The Mirranes of Persia advanced with forty thousand of her best troops to raise the fortifications of Dara and signified the day and the hour on which the citizens should prepare a bath for his refreshment after the toils of victory He encountered an adver sary equal to himself by the new title of general of the east his superior in the science of war but much inferior in the number and quality of his troops which amounted only to twenty five thousand Romans and strangers relaxed in their 1 A

discipline and humbled by recent disasters As the level plain of Dara refused all shelter to stratagem and ambush Belisarius protected his front with a deep trench which was prolonged at first in perpendicular and afterward in parallel lines to cover the wings of cavalry and advantageously posted to command the flanks and rear of the enemy When the Roman centre was shaken their well timed and rapid charge decided the conflict the standard of Persia fell the im mortals fled the infantry threw away their bucklers and eight thousand of the van quished were left on the field of battle In the next campaign Syria was inva ded on the side of the desert and Belisarius with twenty thousand men hastened from Dara to the relief of the province During the whole summer the designs of the enemy were baffled by his skilful dispositions he pressed their retreat oc cupied each night their camp of the preceding day and would have secured a bloodless victory if he could have resisted the impatience of his own troops Their valiant promise was faintly supported in the hour of battle the right wing was ex posed by the treacherous or cowardly desertion of the Christian Arabs the Huns a veteran band of eight hundred warriors were oppressed by superior numbers the flight of the Isaurians was intercepted but the Roman infantry stood firm on the left for Belisarius himself dismounting from his horse showed them that in trepid despair was their only safety They turned their backs to the Euphrates and their faces to the enemy innumerable arrows glanced without effect from the compact and shelving order of their bucklers an impenetrable line of pikes was exposed to the repeated assaults of the Persian cavalry and after a resistance of many hours the remaining troops were skilfully embarked under the shadow of the night The Persian commander retired with disorder and disgrace to an swer a strict account of the lives of so many soldiers which he had consumed in a barren victory But the fame of Belisarius was not sullied by a defeat in which alone he had saved his army from the consequences of their own rashness the approach of peace relieved him from the guard of the eastern frontier and his conduct in the sedition of Constantinople amply discharged his obligations to the emperor When the African war became the topic of popular discourse and se cret deliberation each of the Roman generals was apprehensive rather than am bitious of the dangerous honour but as soon as Justinian had declared his pre ference of superior merit their envy was rekindled by the unanimous applause which was given to the choice of Belisarius The temper of the Byzantine court may encourage a suspicion that the hero was darkly assisted by the intrigues of his wife the fair and subtle Antonina who alternately enjoyed the confidence and incurred the hatred of the empress Theodora The birth of Antonina was igno ble Â he descended from a family of charioteers and her chastity has been stained with the foulest reproach Yet she reigned with long and absolute power over the mind of her illustrious husband and if Antonina disdained the merit of con jugal fidelity she expressed a manly friendship to Belisarius whom she accom panied with undaunted resolution in all the hardships and dangers of a military life l The preparations for the African war were not unworthy of the last contest be tween Rome and Carthage The pride and flower of the army consisted of the guards of Belisarius who according to the pernicious indulgence of the times de voted themselves by a particular oath of fidelity to the service of their patron Their strength and stature for which they had been curiously selected the good ness of their horses and armour and the assiduous practice of all the exercises of war enabled them to act whatever their courage might prompt and their courage was exalted by the social honour of their rank and the personal ambition of favour and fortune Four hundred of the bravest of the Heruli marched under the banner of the faithful and active Pharas their untractable valour was more highly prized than the tame submission of the Greeks and Syrians and of such importance was it deemed to procure a re enforcement of six hundred Massageta or Huns that they were allured by fraud and deceit to engage in a naval expedition Five thousand horse and ten thousand foot were embarked at Constantinople for the conquest of Africa but the infantry for the most part levied in Thrace and Isau ria yielded to the more prevailing use and reputation of the cavalry and the Scy thian bow was the weapon on which the armies of Rome were now reduced to place their principal dependence From a laudable desire to assert the dignity of his theme Procopius defends the soldiers of his own time against the morose cri tics who confined that respectable name to the heavy armed warriors of antiquity 0 See the birth and character of Antonina in the Anecdotes c 1 and tlie notes of Alemanm p 3 38 THE DECLINE AND FALL and maliciously observed that the word archer is introduced by Homer l ass term of contempt Such contempt might perhaps be due to the naked youth who appeared on foot in the fields of Troy and lurking behind a tomb stone or the shield of a friend drew the bow string to their breast 2 and dismissed a fee ble and lifeless arrow But our archers pursues the historian are mounted on horses which they manage with admirable skill their head and shoulders are pro tected by a casque or buckler they wear greaves of iron on their legs and their bodies are guarded by a coat of mail On their right side hangs a quiver a sword on the left and their hand is accustomed to wield a lance or javelin in closer com bat Their bows are strong and weighty they shoot in every possible direction advancing retreating to the front to the rear or to either flank and as they are taught to draw the bow string not to the breast but to the right ear firm indeed must be the armour that can resist the rapid violence of their shaft Five hun dred transports navigated by twenty thousand mariners of Egypt Gilicia and Ionia were collected in the harbour of Constantinople The smallest of these vessels may be computed at thirty the largest at five hundred tons and the fair average will supply an allowance liberal but not profuse of about one hundred thousand tons 3 for the reception of thirty five thousand soldiers and sailors of five thousand horses of arms engines and military stores and of a sufficient stock of water and provisions for a voyage perhaps of three months The proud galleys which in former ages swept the Mediterranean with so many hundred oars had long since disappeared and the fleet of Justinian was escorted only by ninety two light brigantines covered from the missile weapons of the enemy and rowed by two thousand of the brave and robust youth of Constantinople Twenty two generals are named most of whom were afterward distinguished in the wars of Africa and Italy but the supreme command both by land and sea was delegated to Belisarius alone with a boundless power of acting according to his discretion as if the emperor himself were present The separation of the na val and military professions is at once the effect and the cause of modern improve ments in the science of navigation and maritime war In the seventh year of the reign of Justinian and about the time of the summer solstice the whole fleet of six hundred ships was ranged in martial pomp before the gardens of the palace The patriarch pronounced his benediction the empe ror signified his last commands the general s trumpet gave the signal of departure and every heart according to its fears or wishes explored with anxious curiosity the omens of misfortune and success The first halt was made at Perinthus or Heraclea where Belisarius waited five days to receive some Thracian horses a military gift of his sovereign From thence the fleet pursued their course through the midst of the Propontis but as they struggled to pass the straits of the Helles pont an unfavourable wind detained them four days at Abydus where the general exhibited a memorable lesson of firmness and severity Two of the Huns who in a drunken quarrel had slain one of their fellow soldiers were instantly shown to the army suspended on a lofty gibbet The national indignity was resented by their countrymen who disclaimed the servile laws of the empire and asserted the free privilege of Scythia where a small fine was allowed to expiate the hasty sal lies of intemperance and anger Their complaints were specious their clamours were loud and the Romans were not averse to the example of disorder and impu nity But the rising sedition was appeased by the authority and eloquence of the general and he represented to the assembled troops the obligation of justice the importance of discipline the rewards of piety and virtue and the unpardonable guilt of murder which in his apprehension was aggravated rather than excused by the vice of intoxication 4 In the navigation from the Hellespont to Pelopon 1 See the preface of Procopius The enemies of

his master galley conspicuous in the day by the redness of the sails and in the night by the torches blazing from the mast head It was the duty of the pilots as they steered between the islands and turned the capes of Malea and Tasnarium to preserve the just order and regu lar intervals of such a multitude of ships as the wind was fair and moderate their labours were not unsuccessful and the troops were safely disembarked at Methone on the Messenian coast to repose themselves for awhile after the fatigues of the sea In this place they experienced how avarice invested with authority may sport with the lives of thousands which are bravely exposed for the public service According to military practice the bread or biscuit of the Romans was twice pre pared in the oven and a diminution of one fourth was cheerfully allowed for the loss of weight To gain this miserable profit and to save the expense of wood the prefect John of Cappadocia had given orders that the flour should be slightly baked by the same fire which warmed the baths of Constantinople and when the sacks Were opened a soft and mouldy paste was distributed to the army Such unwholesome food assisted by the heat of the climate and season soon produced an epidemical disease which swept away five hundred soldiers Their health was restored by the diligence of Belisarius who provided fresh bread at Methone and boldly expressed his just and humane indignation the emperor heard his com plaint the general was praised but the minister was not punished From the port of Methone the pilots steered along the western coast of Peloponnesus as far as the isle of Zacynthus or Zant before they undertook the voyage in their eyes a most arduous voyage of one hundred leagues over the Ionian sea As the fleet was surprised by a calm sixteen days were consumed in the slow navigation and even the general would have suffered the intolerable hardship of thirst if the in genuity of Antonina had not preserved the water in glass bottles which she buried deep in the sand in a part of the ship impervious to the rays of the sun At length the harbour of Caucana 2 on the southern side of Sicily afforded a secure and hospitable shelter The Gothic officers who governed the island in the name of the daughter and grandson of Theodoric obeyed their imprudent orders to re ceive the troops of Justinian like friends and allies provisions were liberally sup plied the cavalry was reraounted 3 and Procopius soon returned from Syracuse with correct information of the state and designs of the Vandals His intelligence determined Belisarius to hasten his operations and his wise impatience was second ed by the winds The fleet lost sight of Sicily passed before the isle of Malta discovered the capes of Africa ran along the coast with a strong gale from the north east and finally cast anchor off the promontory of Caput Vada about five days journey to the south of Carthage 4 If Gelimer had been informed of the approach of the enemy he must have de layed the conquest of Sardinia for the immediate defence of his person and king dom A detachment of five thousand soldiers and one hundred and twenty galleys â would have joined the remaining forces of the Vandals and the descendant of Gen seric might have surprised and oppressed a fleet of deep laden transports incapa ble of action and of light brigantines that seemed only qualified for flight Beli sarius had secretly trembled when he overheard his soldiers in the passage emboldening each other to confess their apprehensions if they were once on shore they hoped to maintain the honour of their arms but if they should be attacked at sea they did not blush to acknowledge that they wanted courage to contend at the same time with the winds the waves and the barbarians 5 The knowledge of their sentiments decided Belisarius to seize the first opportunity of landing them on the coast of Africa and he prudently rejected in a council of war the proposal of sailing with the fleet and army into the port of Carthage Three months after 1 Or even in three days siace they anchored the first evening in the neighbouring isle of Tenedos the se cond day they

disembarked and five soldiers were left as a guard on board each of the ships which were disposed of in the form of a semicircle The re mainder of the troops occupied a camp on the sea shore which they fortified ac cording to ancient discipline with a ditch and rampart and the discovery of a source_ of fresh water while it allayed the thirst excited the superstitious confidence of the Romans The next morning some of the neighbouring gardens were pillaged and Belisarius after chastising the offenders embraced the slight occasion but the decisive moment of inculcating the maxims of justice moderation and genuine policy â When I first accepted the commission of subduing Africa I depended much less said the general on the numbers or even the bravery of my troops than upon the friendly disposition of the natives and their immortal hatred to the Vandals You alone can deprive me of this hope if you continue to extort by ra pine what might be purchased for a little money such acts of violence will recon cile these implacable enemies and unite them in a just and holy league against the invaders of their country These exhortations were enforced by a rigid disci pline of which the soldiers themselves soon felt and praised the salutary effects The inhabitants instead of deserting their houses or hiding their corn supplied the Romans with a fair and liberal market the civil officers of the province con tinued to exercise their functions in the name of Justinian and the clergy from motives of conscience and interest assiduously laboured to promote the cause of a catholic emperor The small town of Sullecte l one day s journey from the camp had the honour of being foremost to open her gates and to resume her an cient allegiance the larger cities of Leptis and Adrumetum imitated the example of loyalty as soon as Belisarius appeared and he advanced without opposition as far as Grasse a palace of the Vandal kings at the distance of fifty miles from Car thage The weary Romans indulged themselves in the refreshment of shady groves cool fountains and delicious fruits and the preference which Procopius al lows to these gardens over any that he had seen either in the east or west may be ascribed either to the taste or the fatigue of the historian In three generations prosperity and a warm climate had dissolved the hardy virtue of the Vandals who insensibly became the most luxurious of mankind In their villas and gardens which might deserve the Persian name of flaradise 2 they enjoyed a cool and elegant repose and after the daily use of the bath the barbarians were seated at a table profusely spread with the delicacies of the land and sea Their silken robes loosely flowing after the fashion of the Medes were embroidered with gold love and hunting were the labours of their life and their vacant hours were amused by pantomimes chariot races and the music and dances of the theatre In a march of ten or twelve days the vigilance of Belisarius was constantly awake and active against his unseen enemies by whom in every place and at every hour he might suddenly be attacked An officer of confidence and merit John the Armenian led the vanguard of three hundred horse six hundred Massagetai covered at a certain distance the left flank and the whole fleet steering along the coast seldom lost sight of the army which moved each day about twelve miles and lodged in the evening in strong camps or in friendly towns The near ap proach of the Romans to Carthage filled the mind of Gelimer with anxiety and terror He prudently wished to protract the war till his brother with his vete ran troops should return from the conquest of Sardinia and he now lamented the rash policy of his ancestors who by destroying the fortifications of Africa had left him only the dangerous resource of risking a battle in the neighbourhood of his capital The Vandal conquerors from their original number of fifty thousand were multiplied without including their women and children to one hundred and sixty thousand fighting men and such forces animated with valour and union might have crushed at their first landing the feeble and exhausted bands of the Roman general But the friends of the captive king were more inclined to ac cept the invitations than to resist the progress of Belisarius and many a proud barbarian disguised his aversion to war under the more specious name of his ha tred to the usurper Yet the authority and promises of Gelimer collected a for midable army and his plans were concerted with some degree of military skill 1 SulWte is perhaps the Turrsi

despatched to his brother Ammatas to collect all the forces of Car thage and to encounter the van of the Roman array at the distance of ten miles from the city his nephew Gibamund With two thousand horse was destined to attack their left when the monarch himself who silently followed should charge their rear in a situation which excluded them from the aid or even the view of their fleet But the rashness of Ammatas was fatal to himself and his country He anticipated the hour of attack outstripped his tardy followers and was pierced with a mortal wound after he had slain with his own hand twelve of his boldest antagonists His Vandals fled to Carthage the highway almost ten miles was strewed with dead bodies and it seemed incredible that such multitudes could be slaughtered by the swords of three hundred Romans The nephew of Geli mer was defeated after a slight combat by the six hundred Massagetx they did not equal the third part of his numbers but each Scythian was fired by the ex ample of his chief who gloriously exercised the privilege of his family by riding foremost and alone to shoot the first arrow against the enemy In the meanwhile Gelimer himself ignorant of the event and misguided by the windings of the hills inadvertently passed the Roman army and reached the scene of action â where Ammatas had fallen He wept the fate of his brother and of Carthage charged with irresistible fury the advancing squadrons and might have pursued and perhaps decided the victory if he had not wasted those inestimable moments in the discharge of a vain though pious duty to the dead While his spirit was broken by this mournful office he heard the trumpet of Belisarius who leaving Antonina and his infantry in the camp pressed forward with his guards and the remainder of the cavalry to rally his flying troops and to restore the fortune of the day Much room could not be found in this disorderly battle for the talents of a general but the king fled before the hero and the Vandals accustomed only to a Moorish enemy were incapable of withstanding the arms and discipline of the Romans Gelimer retired with hasty steps towards the desert of Numidia but he had soon the consolation of learning that his private orders for the execu tion of Hilderic and his captive friends had been faithfully obeyed The tyrant s revenge was useful only to his enemies The death of a lawful prince excited the compassion of his people his life might have perplexed the victorious Romans and the lieutenant of Justinian by a crime of which he was innocent was re lieved from the painful alternative of forfeiting his honour or relinquishing his con quests As soon as the tumult had subsided the several parts of the army informed each other of the accidents of the day and Belisarius pitched his camp on the field of victory to which the tenth mile stone from Carthage had applied the La tin appellation of decimus From a wise suspicion of the stratagems and resources of the Vandals he marched the next day in order of battle halted in the evening before the gates of Carthage and allowed a night of repose that he might not in darkness and disorder expose the city to the license of the soldiers or the sol diers themselves to the secret ambush of the city But as the fears of Belisarius â were the result of calm and intrepid reason he was soon satisfied that he might confide without danger in the peaceful and friendly aspects of the capital Carthage blazed with innumerable torches the signals of the public joy the chain was removed that guarded the entrance of the port the gates were thrown open and the people with acclamations of gratitude hailed and invited their Roman deliverers The defeat of the Vandals and the freedom of Africa were announced to the city on the eve of St Cyprian when the churches were al ready adorned and illuminated for the festival of the martyr whom three centu ries of superstition had almost raised to a local deity The Arians conscious that their reign had expired resigned the temple to the catholics who rescued their saint from profane hands performed the holy rites and loudly proclaimed the creed of Athanasius and Justinian One awful hour reversed the fortunes of the con tending parties The suppliant Vandals who had so lately indulged the vices of conquerors sought an humble refuge in the sanctuary of the church while the merchants of the east were delivered from the deepest dungeon of the palace by their affrighted keeper who implored the protection of his captives and showed them through an aperture in the wall the sails of the Roman fleet After their separation from the army the naval commanders had proceeded with slow cau tion along the coast till they reached the Hermacan promontory and obtained the first intelligence of the victory of Belisarius Faithful to his instructions they would have cast anchor about twenty miles from Carthage if the more skilful sea vol nr e â THE DECLINE AND FALL men had not represented the perils of the shore and the signs of an impending tempest Still ignorant of the revolution they declined however the rash at tempt of forcing the chain of the port and the adjacent harbour and suburb of Mandracium were insulted only by the rapine of a private officer who disobeyed and deserted his leaders But the imperial fleet advancing with a fair wind steered through the narrow entrance of the Goletta and occupied in the deep and oapacious lake of Tunis a secure station about five miles from the capital 1 No sooner was Belisarius informed of their arrival than he despatched orders that the greatest part of the mariners should be immediately landed to join the triumph and to swell the apparent numbers of the Romans Before he allowed them to enter the gates of Carthage he exhorted them in a discourse worthy of himself and the occasion not to disgrace the glory of their arms and to remem ber that the Vandals had been the tyrants but that they were the deliverers of the Africans who must now be respected as the voluntary and affectionate subjects of their common sovereign The Romans marched through the streets iii close ranks prepared for battle if an enemy had appeared the strict order maintained by the general imprinted on their minds the duty of obedience and in an age in which custom and impunity almost sanctified the abuse of conquest the genius of one man repressed the passions of a victorious army The voice of menace and complaint was silent the trade of Carthage was not interrupted while Africa changed her master and her government the shops continued open and busy and the soldiers after sufficient guards had been posted modestly departed to the houses which were allotted for their reception Belisarius fixed his residence in the palace seated himself on the throne of Genseric accepted and distributed the barbaric spoil granted their lives to the suppliant Vandals and laboured to re pair the damage which the suburb of Mandracium had sustained in the preceding night At supper he entertained his principal officers with the form and magnifi cence of a royal banquet 2 The victor was respectfully served by the captive officers of the household and in the moments of festivity when the impartial spectators applauded the fortune and merit of Belisarius his envious flatterers secretly shed their venom on every word and gesture which might alarm the sus picions of a jealous monarch One day was given to these pompous scenes which may not be despised as useless if they attracted the popular veneration but the active mind of Belisarius which in the pride of victory could suppose a defeat had already resolved that the Roman empire in Africa should not depend on the chance of arms or the favour of the people The fortifications of Carthage had alone been exempted from the general proscription but in the reign of ninety five â years they were suffered to decay by the thoughtless and indolent Vandals A wiser conqueror restored with incredible despatch the walls and ditches of the city His liberality encouraged the workmen the soldiers the mariners and the citi zens vied with each other in the salutary labour and Gelimer who had feared to trust his person in an open town beheld with astonishment and despair the rising strength of an impregnable fortress That unfortunate monarch after the loss of his capital applied himself to col lect the remains of an army scattered rather than destroyed by the preceding battle and the hopes of pillage attracted some Moorish bands to the standard of Gelimer He encamped in the fields of Bulla four days journey from Carthage j insulted the capital which he deprived of the use of an aqueduct proposed a high reward for the head of every Roman affected to spare the persons and property of his African subjects and secretly negotiated with the Anan sectaries and the confederate Huns Under these circumstances the conquest of Sardinia served only to aggravate his distress he reflected with the deepest anguish that he had wasted in that useless enterprise five thousand of his bravest troops and he read with grief and shame the victorious letters of his brother Zano who expressed a sanguine confidence that the king after the example of their ancestors had alrea dy chastised the rashness of the Roman invader Alas my brother replied Gelimer  Heaven has declared against our unhappy nation While you have t The neighbourhood of Carthage the sea the land and he rivers are changed almost at much as the works of man The isthmus or neck of the city is now

restore our empire or perish by our side On the receipt of this epistle Zano imparted his grief to the principal Vandals but the intelligence was prudently concealed from the natives of the island The troops embarked in one hundred and twenty galleys at the port of Cagliari cast anchor the third day on the confines of Mauritania and hastily pursued their march to join the royal standard in the camp of Bulla Mournful was the interview the two brothers embraced they wept in silence no questions were asked of the Sar dinian victory no inquiries were made of the African misfortunes they saw before their eyes the whole extent of their calamities and the absence of their wives and children afforded a melancholy proof that either death or captivity had been their  lot The languid spirit of the Vandals was at length awakened and united by the entreaties of their king the example of Zano and the instant danger which threat ened their monarchy and religion The military strength of the nation advanced to battle and such was the rapid increase that before their army reached Trica meron about twenty miles from Carthage they might boast perhaps with some exaggeration that they surpassed in a tenfold proportion the diminutive powers of the Romans But these powers were under the command of Belisarius and as he was conscious of their superior merit he permitted the barbarians to surprise him at an unseasonable hour The Romans were instantly under arms a rivulet covered their front the cavalry formed the first line which Belisarius supported in the centre at the head of five hundred guards the infantry at some distance was posted in the second line and the vigilance of the general watched the sepa  rate station and ambiguous faith of the Massagetx who secretly reserved their aid For the conquerors The historian has inserted and the reader may easily supply the speeches l of the commanders who by arguments the most apposite to their situation inculcated the importance of victory and the contempt of life Zano with the troops which had followed him to the conquest of Sardinia was placed in the centre and the throne of Genseric might have stood if the multitude of Van dals had imitated their intrepid resolution Casting away their lances and missile weapons they drew their swords and expected the charge the Roman cavalry thrice passed the rivulet they were thrice repulsed and the conflict was firmly maintained till Zano fell and the standard of Belisarius was displayed Gelimer retreated to his camp the Huns joined the pursuit and the victors despoiled the bodies of the slain Yet no more than fifty Romans and eight hundred Vandals were found on the field of battle so inconsiderable was the carnage of a day which extinguished a nation and transferred the empire of Africa In the evening Be lisarius led his infantry to the attack of the camp and the pusillanimous flight of Gelimer exposed the vanity of his recent declarations that to the vanquished death was a relief like a burden and infamy the only object of terror His depar ture was secret but as soon as the Vandals discovered that their king had deserted them they hastily dispersed anxious only for their personal safety and careless of every object that is dear or valuable to mankind The Romans entered the camp without resistance and the wildest scenes of disorder were veiled in the darkness and confusion of the night Every barbarian who met their swords was inhumanly massacred their widows and daughters as rich heirs or beautiful con cubines were embraced by the licentious soldiers and avarice itself was almost satiated with the treasures of gold and silver the accumulated fruits of conquest or economy in a long period of prosperity and peace In this frantic search the troops even of Belisarius forgot their caution and respect Intoxicated with lust and rapine they explored in small parties or alone the adjacent fields the woods the rocks and the caverns that might might possibly conceal any desirable prize laden with booty they deserted their ranks and wandered without a guide on the high road to Carthage and if the flying enemies had dared to return very few of the conquerors would have escaped Deeply sensible of the disgrace and dan O These orations always express the sense of the times and sometimes of the actors 4 have condensed that sense and thrown away declamation 44  THE DECLINE AND FALL ger Belisarius passed an apprehensive night in the field of victory at the dawn of day he planted his standard on a hill recalled his guards and veterans and gra dually restored the modestv and obedience of the camp It was equally the con cern of the Roman general to subdue the hostile and to save the prostrate barba rian and the suppliant Vandals who could be found only in churches were pro tected by his authority disarmed and separately confined that they might neither â disturb the public peace nor become the victims of popular revenge After des patching a light detachment to tread the footsteps of Gelimer he advanced with his whole army about ten days march as far as Hippo Regius which no longer possessed the relics of St Augustin l The season and the certain intelligence that the Vandals had fled to the inaccessible country of the Moors determined Be lisarius to relinquish the vain pursuit and to fix his winter quarters at Carthage From thence he despatched his principal lieutenant to inform the emperor that in the space of three months he had achieved the conquest of Africa Belisarius spoke the language of truth The surviving Vandals yielded with out resistance their arms and their freedom the neighbourhood of Carthage sub mitted to his presence and the more distant provinces were successively subdued by the report of his victory Tripoli was confirmed in her voluntary allegiance Sardinia and Corsica surrendered to an officer who carried instead of a sword the head of the valiant Zano and the isles of Majorca Minorca and Yvica con sented to remain an humble appendage of the African kingdom Csesarea a royal city which in looser geography may be confounded with the modern Algiers was situate thirty days march to the westward of Carthage by land the road was in fested by the Moors but the sea was open and the Romans were now masters of the sea An active and discreet tribune sailed as far as the straits where he oc cupied Septem or Ceuta 2 which rises opposite to Gibraltar on the African coast that remote place was afterward adorned and fortified by Justinian and he seems to have indulged the vain ambition of extending his empire to the columns of Her cules He received the messengers of victory at the time when he was preparing to publish the pandects of the Roman law and the devout or jealous emperor cele brated the divine goodness and confessed in silence the merit of his successful general 3 Impatient to abolish the temporal and spiritual tyranny of the Van dals he proceeded without delay to the full establishment of the catholic church Her jurisdiction wealth and immunities perhaps the most essential part of epis copal religion were restored and amplified with a liberal hand the Arian worship was suppressed the Donatist meetings were proscribed 4 and the synod of Car thage by the voice of two hundred and seventeen bishops 5 applauded the just measure of retaliation On such an occasion it may not be presumed that many orthodox prelates were absent but the comparative smallness of their number which in ancient councils had been twice or even thrice multiplied most clearly indicates the decay both of the church and state While Justinian approved him self the defender of the faith he entertained an ambitious hope that his victorious lieutenant would speedily enlarge the narrow limits of his dominion to the space which they occupied before the invasion of the Moors and Vandals and Belisarius was instructed to establish five dukes or commanders in the convenient stations of Tripoli Leptis Cirta Casarea and Sardinia and to compute the military force of fialatines or borderers that might be sufficient for the defence of Africa The kingdom of the Vandals was not unworthy of the

oppressive but they were not idle and the subtle questions of justice and revenue were infinitely propagated un der the new government which professed to revive the freedom and equity of the Roman republic The conqueror was solicitous to exact a prompt and plentiful supply from his African subjects and he allowed them to claim even in the third degree and from the collateral line the houses and lands of which their families had been unjustly despoiled by the Vandals After the departure of Belisarius who acted by a high and special commission no ordinary provision was made for a master general of the forces but the office of pretorian prefect was intrusted to a soldier the civil and military powers were united according to the practice of Justinian in the chief governor and the representative of the emperor in Africa as well as in Italy was soon distinguished by the appellation of Exarch 1 Yet the conquest of Africa was imperfect till her former sovereign was deli vered either alive or dead into the hands of the Romans Doubtful of the event Gelimer had given secret orders that a part of his treasure should be transported to Spain where he hoped to find a secure refuge at the court of the king of the Visigoths But these intentions were disappointed by accident treachery and the indefatigable pursuit of his enemies who intercepted his flight from the sea shore and chased the unfortunate monarch with some faithful followers to the inacces sible mountain of Papua 2 in the inland country of Numidia He was immedi ately besieged by Pharas an officer whose truth and sobriety were the more ap plauded as such qualities could seldom be found among the Heruli the most cor rupt of the barbarian tribes To his vigilance Belisarius had intrusted this impor tant charge and after a bold attempt to scale the mountain in which he lost a hundred and ten soldiers Pharas expected during a winter siege the operation of distress and famine on the mind of the Vandal king From the softest habits of pleasure from the unbounded command of industry and wealth he was reduced to share the poverty of the Moors 3 supportable only to themselves by their ig norance of a happier condition In their rude hovels of mud and hurdles which confined the smoke and excluded the light they promiscuously slept on the ground perhaps on a sheep skio with their wives their children and their cattle Sor did and scanty were their garments the use of bread and wine was unknown and their oaten or barley cakes imperfectly baked in the ashes were devoured almost in a crude state by the hungry savages The health of Gelimer must have sunk inder these strange and unwonted hardships from whatsoever cause they had been endured but his actual misery was imbittered by the recollection of past greatness the daily insolence of his protectors and the just apprehension that the light and venal Moors might be tempted to betray the rights of hospitality The knowledge of his situation dictated the humane and friendly epistle of Pharas â Like yourself said the chief of the Heruli I am an illiterate barbarian but I speak the language of plain sense and an honest heart Why will you persist in hopeless obstinacy Why will you ruin yourself your family and nation The love of freedom and abhorrence of slavery Alas my dearest Gelimer are you not already the worst of slaves the slave of the vile nation of the Moors Would it not be preferable to sustain at Constantinople a life of poverty and servitude ra ther than to reign the undoubted monarch of the mountain of Papua Do you think it a disgrace to be the subject of Justinian Belisarius is his subject and we ourselves whose birth is not inferior to your own are not ashamed of our obedience to the Roman emperor That generous prince will grant you a rich inheritance of lands a place in the senate and the dignity of a patrician such are his gracious intentions and you may depend with full assurance on the word of

my implacable hatred Him I had never injured either by word or deed yet he has sent against me I know not from whence a certain Belisarius who has cast me headlong from the throne into this abyss of misery Justinian is a man he is a prince does he not dread for himself a similar reverse of fortune I can write no more my grief oppresses me Send me I beseech you my dear Pharas send me a lyre 1 a sponge and a loaf of bread From the Vandal mes senger Pharas was informed of the motives of this singular request It was long since the king of Africa had tasted bread a defluxion had fallen on his eyes the effect of fatigue or incessant weeping and he wished to solace the melancholy hours by singing to the lyre the sad story of his own misfortunes The humanity of Pharas was moved he sent the three extraordinary gifts but even his humani ty prompted him to redouble the vigilance of his guard that he might sooner com pel his prisoner to embrace a resolution advantageous to the Romans but salutary to himself The obstinacy of Gelimer at length yielded to reason and necessity the solemn assurances of safety and honourable treatment were ratified in the em peror s name by the ambassador of Belisarius and the king of the Vandals de scended from the mountain The first public interview was in one of the suburbs of Carthage and when the royal captive accosted his conqueror he burst into a fit of laughter The crowd might naturally believe that extreme grief had deprived Gelimer of his senses but in this mournful state unseasonable mirth insinuated to more intelligent observers that the vain and transitory scenes of human greatness are unworthy of a serious thought 2 Their contempt was soon justified by a new example of a vulgar truth that flattery adheres to power and envy to superior merit The chiefs of the Roman army presumed to think themselves the rivals of a hero Their private despatches maliciously affirmed that the conqueror of Africa strong in his reputation and the public love conspired to seat himself on the throne of the Vandals Justinian listened with too patient an ear and his silence was the result of jealousy rather than of confidence An honourable alternative of remaining in the province or of returning to the capital was indeed submitted to the discretion of Belisarius but he wisely concluded from intercepted letters and the knowledge of his sovereign s temper that he must either resign his head erect his standard or confound his enemies by his presence and submission Innocence and courage decided his choice his guards captives and treasures were diligently embarked and so prosperous was the navigation that his arrival at Constantinople preceded any certain account of his departure from the port of Carthage Such unsuspecting loyalty removed the apprehensions of Justinian envy was silenced and inflamed by the public gratitude and a third Africanus obtained the honours of a triumph a ceremony which the city of Constantinople had never seen and which ancient Rome since the reign of Tiberius had reserved for the ausfiiciom arms of the Cxsars 3 From the palace of Belisarius the procession was conducted through the principal streets of the hippodrome and this memorable day seemed to avenge the injuries of Genseric and to expiate the shame of the Romans The wealth of nations was displayed the trophies of martial or effeminate luxury rich armour golden thrones and the chariots of state which had been used by the Van dal queen the massy furniture of the royal banquet the splendour of precious stones the elegant forms of statues and vases the more substantial treasure of gold and the holy vessels of the Jewish temple which after their long peregri nation were respectfully deposited in the Christian church of Jerusalem A long train of the noblest Vandals reluctantly exposed their lofty stature and manly Countenance Gelimer slowly advanced he was Clad in a purple robe and still maintained the majesty of a king Not a tear escaped from his eyes not a sigh was heard but his pride or piety derived some secret consolation from the words 1 By Procopins it is styled a lyre perhaps harp would have been mote national The instruments of mu sic are those distinguished by Venantius Fortunatus â Romauusque lyra tibi plaudit Barbarus harpa 2 Herodotus elegantly describes the strange effects of grief in another roya captive Psammetichui of Egypt who wept at the lesser and was silent at the greatest of his calamities lib iii c 14 In the interview of Paulus jEmilius and Perses Belisarius might study his part but it is probable that he never read either Livy or Plutarch and it is certain that his generosity did not need a tutor 3 After the title of imperatar had lost the old military sense and the Roman auspices were abolished by Christianity see La Bleterie Mem de 1 Academic torn xii p 302â 332 a triumph might be given with less inconsistency to a private general m OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 4 of Solomon l which he repeatedly pronounced  Vanity vanity all is vanity Instead of ascending a triumphal car drawn by four horses or elephants the mo dest conqueror marched on foot at the head of his brave companions his prudence might decline an honour too conspicuous for a subject and his magnanimity might justly disdain what had been so often sullied by the vilest of tyrants The glorious procession entered the gate of the hippodrome was saluted by the acclamations of the senate and people and halted before the throne where Justinian and Theo dora were seated to receive the homage of the captive monarch and the victorious hero They both performed the customary adoration and falling prostrate on the ground respectfully touched the footstool of a prince who had not unsheathed his sword and of a prostitute who had danced on the theatre some gentle violence was used to bend the stubborn spirit of the grandson of Genseric and however trained to servitude the genius of Belisarius must have secretly rebelled He was immediately declared consul for the ensuing year and the day of his in auguration resembled the pomp of a second triumph his curule chair was borne aloft on the shoulders of captive Vandals and the spoils of war gold cups and rich girdles were profusely scattered among the populace But the purest reward of Belisarius was in the faithful execution of a treaty for which his honour had been pledged to the king of the Vandals The religious scruples of Gelimer who adhered to the Arian heresy were incompatible with the dignity of senator or patrician but he received from the emperor an ample es tate in the province of Galatia where the abdicated monarch retired with his fa mily and friends to a life of peace of affluence and perhaps of content 2 Th6 daughters of Hilderic were entertained with the respectful tenderness due to their age and misfortune and Justinian and Theodora accepted the honour of educating and enriching the female descendants of the great Theodosius The bravest of the Vandal youth were distributed into five squadrons of cavalry which adopted the name of their benefactor and supported in the Persian wars the glory of their an cestors But these rare exceptions the reward of birth or valour are insufficient to explain the fate of a nation whose numbers before a short and bloodless war amounted to more than six hundred thousand persons After the exile of their king and nobles the servile crowd might purchase their safety by abjuring their cha racter religion and language and their degenerate posterity would be insensibly mingled with the common herd of African subjects Yet even in the present age and in the heart of the Moorish tribes a curious traveller ha discovered the white complexion and long flaxen hair of a northern race 3 and it was formerly believed that the boldest of the Vandals fled beyond the power or even the knowledge of the Romans to enjoy their solitary freedom on the shores of the Atlantic ocean 4 Africa had been their empire it became their prison nor could they entertain a hope or even a wish of returning to the banks of the Elbe where their brethren of a spirit less adventurous still wandered in their native forests It was impossi ble for cowards to surmount the barriers of unknown seas and hostile barbarians  it was impossible for brave men to expose their nakedness and defeat before the eyes of their countrymen to describe the kingdoms which they had lost and to claim a share of the humble inheritance which in a happier hour they had al most unanimously renounced 5 In the country between the Elbe and the Oder se veral populous villages of Lusatia are inhabited by the Vandals they still preserve their language their customs and the purity of their blood support with some impatience the Saxon or Prussian yoke and serve with secret and voluntary allegiance the descendant of their ancient kings who in his garb and present 1 If the

the conquerors of Africa But the use of a Sclavonian dialect more clearly represents them as the last remnant of the new colonies who suc ceeded to the genuine Vandals already scattered or destroyed in the age of Proco pius 2 If Belisarius had been tempted to hesitate in his allegiance he might have urged even against the emperor himself the indispensable duty of saving Africa from an enemy more barbarous than the Vandals The origin of the Moors is involved in darkness they were ignorant of the use of letters 3 Their limits cannot be precisely defined a boundless continent was open to the Lybian shepherds the change of seasons and pastures regulated their motions and their rude huts and slender furniture were transported with the same ease as their arms their families and their cattle which consisted of sheep oxen and camels 4 During the vi gour of the Roman power they observed a respectful distance from Carthage and the sea shore under the feeble reign of the Vandals they invaded the cities of Numidia occupied the sea coast from Tangier to Cxsaria and pitched their camps with impunity in the fertile province of Byzacium The formidable strength whose vanity aspired to receive in the emperor s name the ensigns of their regal dignity 5 They were astonished by the rapid event and trembled in the pre sence of their conqueror But his approaching departure soon relieved the ap prehensions of a savage and superstitious people the number of their wives al lowed them to disregard the safety of their infant hostages and when the Roman general hoisted sail in the port of Carthage he heard the cries and almost beheld the flames of the desolated province Yet he persisted in his resolution and leaving only a part of his guards to re enforce the feeble garrisons he intrusted the command of Africa to the eunuch Solomon 6 who proved himself not unworthy to be the successor of Belisarius In the first invasion some detachments with two officers of merit were surprised and intercepted but Solomon speedily as sembled his troops marched from Carthage into the heart of the country and in two great battles destroyed sixty thousand of the barbarians The Moors depended on their multitude their swiftness and their inaccessible mountains and the aspect and smell of their camels are said to have produced some confusion in the Roman cavalry 7 But as soon as they were commanded to dismount they derided this contemptible obstacle as soon as the columns as cended the hills the naked and disorderly crowd was dazzled by glittering arms and regular evolutions

Solomon pursued his march to the west the long lost province of Mauritanian Sitifi was again annexed to the Roman empire The Moorish war continued several years after the departure of Belisarius but the laurels which he resigned to a faithful lieutenant may be justly ascribed to his own triumph The experience of past faults which may sometimes correct the mature age of an individual is seldom profitable to the successive generations of mankind The nations of antiquity careless of each others safety were separately vanquished and â enslaved by the Romans This awful lesson might have instructed the barbarians of the west to oppose with timely counsels and confederate arms the unbounded ambition of Justinian Yet the same error was repeated the same consequences were felt and the Goths both of Italy and Spain insensible of their approaching danger beheld with indifference and even with joy the rapid downfal of the Vandals After the failure of the royal line Theudes a valiant and powerful chief ascended the throne of Spain which he had formerly administered in the name of Theodoric and his infant grandson Under his command the Visigoths besieged the fortress of Ceuta on the African coast but while they spent the sab bath day in peace and devotion the pious security of their camp was invaded by a sally from the town and the king himself with some difficulty and danger es caped from the hands of a sacrilegious enemy 1 It was not long before his pride and resentment were gratified by a suppliant embassj from the unfortunate Geli mer who implored in his distress the aid of the Spanish monarch But instead of sacrificing these unworthy passions to the dictates of generosity and prudence Theudes amused the ambassadors till he was secretly informed of the loss of Car thage and then dismissed them with the obscure and contemptuous advice to seek in their native country a true knowledge of the state of the Vandals 2 The long continuance of the Italian war delayed the punishment of the Visigoths and the eyes of Theudes were closed before they tasted the fruits of his mistaken po licy After his death the sceptre of Spain was disputed by a civil war The weaker candidate solicited the protection of Justinian and ambitiously subscribed a treaty of alliance which deeply wounded the independence and happiness of bis country Several cities both on the ocean and the Mediterranean were ceded to the Roman troops who afterwards refused to evacuate those pledges as it should seem either of safety or payment and as they were fortified by perpetual sup plies from Africa they maintained their impregnable stations for the mischie vous purpose of inflaming the civil and religious factions of the barbarians Se venty years elapsed before this painful thorn could be extirpated from the bosom of the monarchy and as long as the emperors retained any share of these remote and useless possessions their vanity might number Spain in the list of their provinces and the

was resigned to the Vandals and the princess Am alafrida was attended by a martial train of one thousand nobles and five thousand Gothic soldiers who signalized their valour in the Moorish wars Their merit was overrated by themselves and perhaps neglected by the Vandals they viewed   the country with envy and the conquerors with disdain but their real or fictitious conspiracy was prevented by a massacre the Goths were oppressed and the cap tivity of Amalafrida was 60on followed by her secret and suspicious death The eloquent pen of Cassrodorus was employed to reproach the Vandal court with the cruel violation of every social and public duty but the vengeance which he threat ened in the name of his sovereign might be derided with impunity as long as Africa was protected by the sea and the Goths were destitute of a navy In the blind impotence of grief and indignation they joyfully saluted the approach of the Romans entertained the fleet of Belisarius in the ports of Sicily and were speedi ly delighted or alarmed by the surprising intelligence that their revenge was ex ecuted beyond the measure of their hopes or perhaps of their wishes To their friendship the emperor was indebted for the kingdom of Africa and the Goths might reasonably think that they were entitled to resume the possession of a bar ren rock so recently separated as a nuptial gift from the island of Sicily They Were soon undeceived by the haughty mandate of Belisarius which excited their tardy and unavailing repentance The city and promontory of Lilybseum said the Roman general  belonged to the Vandals and I claim them by the right of conquest Your submission may deserve the favour of the emperor your obstinacy will provoke his displeasure and must kindle a war that can terminate only in your utter ruin If you compel us to take up arms we shall contend not to regain the possession of a single city but to deprive you of all the provinces which you unjustly withhold from their lawful sovereign A nation of two hundred thousand soldiers might have smiled at the vain me nace of Justinian and his lieutenant but a spirit of discord and disaffection pre vailed in Italy and the Goths supported with reluctance the indignity of a fe male reign 3 The birth of Amalasontha the regent and queen of Italy 4 united the two most illustrious families of the barbarians Her mother the sister of Clovis was descended from the long haired kings of the Merovingian race 4 and the regal succession of the Amali was illustrated in the eleventh generation by her father the great Theodoric whose merit might have ennobled a plebeian origin The sex of his daughter excluded her from the Gothic throne but his vigilant tender ness for his family and his people discovered the last heir of the royal line whose ancestors had taken refuge in Spain and the fortunate Eutharic was suddenly ex alted to the rank of a consul and a prince He enjoyed only a short time the charms of Amalasontha and the hopes of a succession and his widow after the death of her husband and father was left the guardian of her son Athalaric and the kingdom of Italy At the age of about twenty eight years the endowments of her mind and person had attained their perfect maturity Her beauty which in the apprehension of Theodora herself might have disputed the conquest of an emperor was animated by manly sense activity and resolution Education and experience had cultivated her talents her philosophic studies were exempt from vanity and though she expressed herself with equal elegance and ease in the Greek the Latin and the Gothic tongue the daughter of Theodoric maintained in her counsels a discreet and impenetrable silence By a faithful imitation of the virtues she revived the prosperity of his reign while she

inflict any corporal or pecuniary penalties on her Roman subjects and she generously despised the clamours of the Goths who at the end of forty years still considered the people of Italy as their slaves or their enemies Her salutary measures were directed by the wisdom and celebrated by the eloquence of Cassiodorus she solicited and deserved the friend ship of the emperor and the kingdoms of Europe respected both in peace and â war the majesty of the Gothic throne But the future happiness of the queen and of Italy depended on the education of her son who was destined by his birth to support the different and almost incompatible characters of the chief of a bar barian camp and the first magistrate of a civilized nation From the age of ten years l Athalaric was diligently instructed in the arts and sciences either use ful or ornamental for a Roman prince and three venerable Goths were chosen to instil the principles of honour and virtue into the mind of their young king But the pupil who is insensible of the benefits must abhor the restraints of education and the solicitude of the queen which affection rendered anxious and severe of fended the untractable nature of her son and his subjects On a solemn festival â when the Goths were assembled in the palace of Ravenna the royal youth es caped from his mother s apartment and with tears of pride and anger complained of a blow which his stubborn disobedience had provoked her to inflict The bar barians resented the indignity which had been offered to their king accused the regent of conspiring against his life and crown and imperiously demanded that the grandson of Theodoric should be rescued from the dastardly discipline of wo men and pedants and educated like a valiant Goth in the society of his equals and the glorious ignorance of his ancestors To this rude clamour importunate ly urged as the voice of the nation Amalasontha was compelled to yield her rea son and the dearest wishes of her heart The king of Italy was abandoned to wine to women and to rustic sports and the indiscreet contempt of the ungrate ful youth betrayed the mischievous designs of his favourites and her enemies En compassed with domestic foes she entered into a secret negotiation with the empe ror Justinian obtained the assurance of a friendly reception and had actually depo sited at Dyrrachium in Epirus a treasure of forty thousand pounds of gold Hap Sy would it have been for her fame and safety if she had calmly retired from bar arous faction to the peace and splendour of Constantinople But the mind of Amalasontha was inflamed by ambition and revenge and while her ships lay at anchor in the port she waited for the success of a crime which her passions ex cused or applauded as an act of justice Three of the most dangerous malecon tents had been separately removed under the pretence of trust and command to the frontiers of Italy they were assassinated by her private emissaries and the blood of those noble Goths rendered the queen mother absolute in the court of Ravenna and justly odious to a free people But if she had lamented the disorder of her son she soon wept his irreparable loss and the death of Athalaric who at the age of sixteen was consumed by premature intemperance left her destitute of any firm support or legal authority Instead of submitting to the laws of her country which held as a fundamental maxim that the succession could never pass from the lance to the distaff the daughter of Theodoric conceived the im practicable design of sharing with one of her cousins the regal title and of re serving in her own hands the substance of supreme power He received the pro posal with profound respect and affected gratitude and the eloquent Cassiodorus announced to the senate and to the emperor that Amalasontha and Theodatus had ascended the throne of Italy His birth for his mother was the sister of Theodoric might be considered as an imperfect title and the choice of Amalasontha was more strongly directed by her contempt of his avarice and pusillanimity which had de prived him of the love of the Italians and the esteem of the barbarians But The odatus was exasperated by the contempt which he deserved her justice had repres sed and reproached the oppression which he exercised against his Tuscan neigh bours and the principal Goths united by common guilt and resentment conspired to instigate his slow and timid disposition The letters of congratulation were scarcely despatched before the queen of Italy was imprisoned in a small island of the lake of

his turbulent subjects to shed the blood of their sovereigns Justinian beheld with joy the dissensions of the Goths and the mediation of an ally concealed and promoted the ambitious views of the conqueror His am bassadors in their public audience demanded the fortress of Lilybaeum ten bar barian fugitives and a just compensation for the pillage of a small town on the Illyri an borders but they secretly negotiated with Theodatus to betray the province of Tuscany and tempted Amalasontha to extricate herself from danger and per plexity by a free surrender of the kingdom of Italy A false and servile epistle was subscribed by the reluctant hand of the captive queen but the confession of the Roman senators who were sent to Constantinople revealed the truth of her deplorable situation and Justinian by the voice of a new ambassador most power fully interceded for her life and liberty Yet the secret instructions of the same minister were adapted to serve the cruel jealousy of Theodora who dreaded the presence and superior charms of a rival he prompted with artful and ambiguous hints the execution of a crime so useful to the Romans l received the intelligence of her death with grief and indignation and denounced in his master s name im mortal war against the perfidious assassin In Italy as well as in Africa the guilt of a usurper appeared to justify the arms of Justinian but the forces which he prepared were insufficient for the subversion of a mighty kingdom if their feeble numbers had not been multiplied by the name the spirit and the conduct of a hero A chosen troop of guards who served on horseback and were armed with lances and bucklers attended the person of Belisarius his cavalry was composed of two hundred Huns three hundred Moors and four thousand confederates and the infantry consisted only of three thousand Isaurians Steering the same course as in his former expedition the Roman consul cast anchor before Catana in Sicily to survey the strength of the island and to decide whether he should attempt the conquest or peaceably pursue his voyage to the African coast He found a fruitful land and a friendly people Notwithstanding the decay of agriculture Sicily still supplied the granaries of Rome the farmers were graciously exempted from the oppression of their military quarters and the Goths who trusted the defence of the island to the inhabitants had some reason to complain that their confidence was ungratefully betrayed instead of soliciting and expecting aid of the king of Italy they yielded to the first summons a cheerful obedience and this province the first fruits of the Punic wars was again after a long separation united to the Ro man empire 2 The Gothic garrison of Palermo which alone attempted to re sist was reduced after a short siege by a singular stratagem Belisarius intro duced his ships into the deepest recess of the harbour their boats were laborious ly hoisted with ropes and pulleys to the topmast head and he filled them with archers who from that superior station commanded the ramparts of the city After this easy though successful campaign the conqueror entered Syracuse in triumph at the head of his victorious bands distributing gold medals to the people on the day which so gloriously terminated the year of the consulship He passed the winter season in the palace of the ancient kings amidst the ruins of a Grecian co lony which once extended to a circumference of two and twenty miles 3 but in the spring about the festival of Easter the prosecution of his designs was interrupt ed by a dangerous revolt of the African forces Carthage was saved by the pre sence of Belisarius who suddenly landed with a thousand guards Two thousand soldiers of doubtful faith returned to the standard of their old commanderr and he marched without hesitation above fifty miles to seek an enemy whom he affected to pity and despise Eight thousand rebels trembled at his approach they were routed at the

sedition which was kindled during his absence in his own camp l Disorder and disobedience were the common maladies of the times the genius to command and the virtue to obey resided only in the mind of Beli sarius Although Theodatus descended from a race of heroes he was ignorant of the art and averse to the dangers of war Although he had studied the writings of Plato and Tully philosophy was incapable of purifying his mind from the basest passions avarice and fear He had purchased a sceptre by ingratitude and mur der at the first menace of an enemy he degraded his own majesty and that of a nation which already disdained their unworthy sovereign Astonished by the re cent example of Gelimer he saw himself dragged in chains through the streets of Constantinople the terrors which Belisarius inspired were heightened by the elo quence of Peter the Byzantine ambassador and that bold and subtle advocate persuaded him to sign a treaty too ignominious to become the foundation of a lasting peace It was stipulated that in the acclamations of the Roman people the name of the emperor should always be proclaimed before that of the Gothic king and that as often as the statue of Theodatus was erected in brass or marble the divine image of Justinian should be placed on its right hand Instead of conferring the king of Italy was reduced to solicit the honours of the senate and the consent of the emperor was made indispensable before he could execute against a priest or senator the sentence either of death or confiscation The feeble monarch resigned the possession of Sicily offered as the annual mark of his dependence a crown of gold of the weight of three hundred pounds and promised to supply at the requi sition of his sovereign three thousand Gothic auxiliaries for the service of the em pire Satisfied with these extraordinary concessions the successful agent of Jus tinian hastened his journey to Constantinople but no sooner had he reached the Alban Villa 2 than he was recalled by the anxiety of Theodatus and the dialogue which passed between the king and the ambassador deserves to be represented in its original simplicity  Are you of opinion that the emperor will ratify this treaty Perhaps If he refuses what consequence will ensue War Will such a war be just or reasonable Most assuredly every one should act accord ing to his character What is your meaning You are a philosopherâ Justi nian is emperor of the Romans it would ill become the disciple of Plato to shed the blood of thousands in his private quarrel the successor of Augustus should vin dicate his rights and recover by arms the ancient provinces of his empire This reasoning might not convince bu it was sufficient to alarm and subdue the weak ness of Theodatus and he soon descended to his last offer that for the poor equiva lent of a pension of 48 000 sterling he would resign the kingdom of the Goths and Italians and spend the remainder of his days in the innocent pleasures of philosophy and agriculture Both treaties were intrusted to the hands of the ambassador on the frail security of an oath not to produce the second till the first had been positively re jected The event may be easily foreseen Justinian required and accepted the abdi cation of the Gothic king His indefatigable agent returned from Constantinople to Ravenna with ample instructions and a fair epistle which praised the wisdom and generosity of the royal philosopher granted his pension with the assurance of such honours as a subject and a catholic might enjoy and wisely referred the final exe cution of the treaty to the presence and authority of Belisarius But in the inter val of suspense two Roman generals who had entered the province of Dalmatia were defeated and slain by the Gothic troops From blind and abject despair Theodatus capriciously rose to groundless and fatal presumption 3 and dared to receive with menace and contempt the ambassador of Justinian who claimed his promise solicited the allegiance of his subjects and boldly asserted the invio lable privilege of his own character The march of Belisarius dispelled this vi sionary pride and as the first campaign 4 was employed in

ANJJ FALL the invasion of Italy is applied by Procopius to the second year of the Gothic war l After Belisarius had left sufficient garrisons in Palermo and Syracuse he em barked his troops at Messina and landed them without resistance on the oppo site shores of Rhegium A Gothic prince who had married the daughter of Theodatus was stationed with an army to guard the entrance of Italy but he imitated without scruple the example of a sovereign faithless to his public and private duties The perfidious Ebermor deserted with his followers to the Roman camp and was dismissed to enjoy the servile honours of the Byzantine court 2 From Rhegium to Naples the fleet and army of Belisarius almost always in view of each other advanced near three hundred miles along the sea coast The peo ple of Bruttium Lucania and Campania who abhorred the name and religion of the Goths embraced the specious excuse that their ruined walls were incapable of defence the soldiers paid a just equivalent for a plentiful market and curiosity alone interrupted the peaceful occupations of the husbandman or artificer Na ples which has swelled to a great and populous capital long cherished the lan guage and manners of a Grecian colony 3 and the choice of Virgil had ennobled this elegant retreat which attracted the lovers of repose and study from the noise the smoke and the laborious opulence of Rome 4 As soon as the place was in vested by sea and land Belisarius gave audience to the deputies of the people who exhorted him to disregard a conquest unworthy of his arms to seek the Gothic king in a field of battle and after his victory to claim as the sovereign of Rome the allegiance of the dependent cities â When I treat with my enemies replied the Roman chief with a haughty smile  I am more accustomed to give than to re ceivecounsel but I hold in one hand inevitable ruin and in the other peace and freedom such as Sicily now enjoys The impatience of delay urged him to grant the most liberal terms his honour secured their performance but Naples was di vided into two factions and the Greek democracy was inflamed by their orators who with much spirit and some truth represented to the multitude that the Goths would punish their defection and that Belisarius himself must esteem their loyal ty and valour Their deliberations however were not perfectly free the city was commanded by eight hundred barbarians whose wives and children were detained at Ravenna as the pledges of their fidelity and even the Jews who were rich and numerous resisted with desperate enthusiasm the intolerant laws of Justinian In a much later period the circumference of Naples 5 measured only two thou sand three hundred and sixty three paces 6 the fortifications were defended by precipices or the sea when the aqueducts were intercepted a supply of water might be drawn from wells and fountains and the stock of provisions was sufficient to consume the patience of the besiegers At the end of twenty days that of Be lisarius was almost exhausted and he had reconciled himself to the disgrace of abandoning the siege that he might march before the winter season against Rome and the Gothic king But his anxiety was relieved by the bold curiosity of an Isau rian who explored the dry channel of an aqueduct and secretly reported that a passage might be perforated to introduce a file of armed soldiers into the heart of the city When the work had been silently executed the humane general risked the discovery of his secret by a last and fruitless admonition of the impending dan ger In the

citizens of Naples had expected their deliverance from a prince who remained the inactive and almost indifferent spectator of their ruin Theodatus secured his person within the walls of Rome while his cavalry ad vanced forty miles on the Appian way and encamped in the Pomptine marshes which by a canal of nineteen miles in length had been recently drained and con verted into excellent pastures 3 But the principal forces of the Goths were dis persed in Dalmatia Venetia and Gaul and the feeble mind of their king was con founded by the unsuccessful event of a divination which seemed to presage the downfal of his empire 4 The most abject slaves have arraigned the guilt or weakness of an unfortunate master The character of Theodatus was rigorously scrutinized by a free and idle camp of barbarians conscious of their privilege and power he was declared unworthy of his race his nation and his throne and their general Vitiges whose valour had been signalized in the Illyrian war was raised with unanimous applause on the bucklers of his companions On the first rumour the abdicated monarch fled from the justice of his country but he was pursued by private revenge A Goth whom he had injured in his love overtookTheodatus on the Flaminian way and regardless of his unmanly cries slaughtered him as he lay prostrate on the ground like a victim says the historian at the foot of the altar _ The choice of the people is the best and purest title to reign over them yet such is the prejudice of every age that Vitiges impatiently wished to return to Ravenna where he might seize with the reluctant hand of the daughter of Ama lasontha some faint shadow of hereditary right A national council was immedi ately held and the new monarch reconciled the impatient spirit of the barbarians a measure of disgrace which the misconduct of his predecessor rendered wise and indispensable The Goths consented to retreat in the presence of a vic torious enemy to delay till the next spring the operations of offensive war to summon their scattered forces to relinquish their distant possessions and to trust even Rome itself to the faith of its inhabitants Leuderis an aged warrior was left in the capital with four thousand soldiers a feeble garrison which might have seconded the zeal though it was incapable of opposing the wishes of the Ro mans But a momentary enthusiasm of religion and patriotism was kindled in their minds They furiously exclaimed that the apostolic throne should no longer be profaned by the triumph or toleration of Arianism that the tombs of the Cae sars should no longer be

Capua and halted at the separation of the Latin and Appian ways The work of the censor after the incessant use of nine centuries still preserved its primeval beauty and not a flaw could be discovered in the large polished stones of which that solid though narrow road was so firmly compacted 1 Belisarius however preferred the Latin way which at a distance from the sea and marshes skirted in the space of one hundred and twenty miles along the foot of the mountains His enemies had disappeared when he made his entrance through the Asinarian gate the garri son departed without molestation along the Flaminian way and the city after six ty years servitude was delivered from the yoke of the barbarians Leuderis alone from a motive of pride or discontent refused to accompany the fugitives and the Gothic chief himself a trophy of the victory was sent with the keys of Rome to the throne of the emperor Justinian 2 The first days which coincided with the old Saturnalia were devoted to mu tual congratulations and the public joy and the catholics prepared to celebrate without a rival the approaching festival of the nativity of Christ In the fami liar conversation of a hero the Romans acquired some notion of the virtues which history ascribed to their ancestors they were edified by the apparent respect of Belisarius for the successor of St Peter and his rigid discipline secured in the midst of war the blessings of tranquillity and justice They applauded the rapid success of his arms which overran the adjacent country as far as Narni Perusia and Spo leto but they trembled the senate the clergy and the unwarlike people as soon as they understood that he had resolved and would speedily be reduced to sustain a siege against the powers of the Gothic monarchy The designs of Vitiges were executed during the winter season with diligence and effect From their rustic habitations from their distant garrisons the Goths assembled at Ravenna for the defence of their country and such were their numbers that after an army had been detached for the relief of Dalmatia one hundred and fifty thousand fighting men marched under the royal standard According to the degrees of rank or me rit the Gothic king distributed arms and horses rich gifts and liberal promises he moved along the Flaminian way declined the useless sieges of Perusia and Spoleto respected the impregnable rock of Narni and arrived within two miles â of Rome at the foot of the Milvian bridge The narrow passage was fortified with a tower and Belisarius had computed the value of the twenty davs which must be lost in the construction of another bridge But the consternation of the soldiers of the tower who either fled or deserted disappointed his hopes and betrayed his person into the most imminent danger At the head of one thousand horse the Roman general sallied from the Flaminian gate to mark the ground of an advantageous position and to survey the camp of the barbarians but while he still believed them on the other side of the Tiber he was suddenly encompassed and assaulted by their innumerable squadrons The fate of Italy depended on his life and the deserters pointed to the conspicuous horse a bay 3

pursued to their camp and the Romans oppressed by multitudes made a gradual and at length a precipitate retreat to the gates of the city the gates were shut against the fugitives and the public terror was increased by the report that Belisarius was slain His countenance was indeed disfigured by sweat dust and blood his voice was hoarse his strength was almost exhausted but his unconquerable spirit still remained he imparted that spirit to his despond ing companions and their last desperate charge was felt by the flying barbarians as if a new army vigorous and entire had been poured from the city The Fla minian gate was thrown open to a real triumph but it was not before Belisarius had visited every post and provided for the public safety that he could be per suaded by his wife and friends to taste the needful refreshments of food and sleep In the more improved state of the art of war a general is seldom required or even permitted to display the personal prowess of a soldier and the example of Belisarius may be added to the rare examples of Henry IV of Pyrrhus and of Alexander After this first and unsuccessful trial of their enemies the whole army of the Goths passed the Tiber and formed the siege of the city which continued above a year till their final departure Whatever fancy may conceive the severe com pass of the geographer defines the circumference of Rome within a line of twelve miles and three hundred and forty five paces and that circumference except in the Vatican has invariably been the same from the triumph of Aurelian to the peaceful but obscure reign of the modern popes l But in the day of her great ness the space within her walls was crowded with habitations and inhabitants and the populous suburbs that stretched along the public roads were darted like so many rays from one common centre Adversity swept away these extraneous ornaments and left naked and desolate a considerable part even of the seven hills Yet Rome in its present state could send into the field above thirty thousand males of a military age 2 and notwithstanding the want of discipline and ex ercise the far greater part inured to the hardships of poverty might be capable of bearing arms for the defence of their country and religion The prudence of Belisarius did not neglect this important resource His soldiers were relieved by the zeal and diligence of the people who watched while they slept and laboured w hile they reposed he accepted the voluntary service of the bravest and most in digent of the Roman youth and the companies of townsmen sometimes represent ed in a vacant post the presence of the troops which had been drawn away to more essential duties But his just confidence was placed in the veterans who had 4fought under his banner in the Persian and African wars and although that gallant band was reduced to five thousand men he undertook with such contemptible numbers to defend a circle of twelve miles against an army of one hundred and fifty thousand barbarians In the walls of Rome which Belisarius constructed or restored the materials of ancient architecture may be discerned 3 and the â whole fortification was completed except

impervious and the mole or sepolchre of Hadrian l was ton verted for the first time to the use of a citadel That venerable structure which contained the ashes of the Antonines was a circular turret rising from a quadrangu lar basis it was covered with the white marble of Paros and decorated by the sta tues of gods and heroes and the lover of the arts must read with a sigh that the works of Praxiteles or Lysippus were torn from their lofty pedestals and hurled into the ditch on the heads or the besiegers 2 To each of his lieutenants Be lisarius assigned the defence of a gate with the wise and peremptory instruction that whatever might be the alarm they should steadilyadhere to their respective posts and trust their general for the safety of Rome The formidable host of the Goths as insufficient to embrace the ample measure of the city of the fourteen gates seven only were invested from the Prsenestine to the Flaminian way and Vitiges divided his troop into six camps each of which was fortified with a ditch ana rampart On the Tuscan side of the river a seventh encampment was formed in the field or circus of the Vatican for the important purpose of command ing the Milvian bridge and the course of the Tiber but they approached with de votion the adjacent church of St Peter and the threshold of the holy apostles was respected during the siege by a Christian enemy In the ages of victory as often as the senate decreed some distant conquest the consul denounced hostili ties by unbarring in solemn pomp the gates of the temple of Janus 3 Do mestic war now rendered the admonition superfluous and the ceremony was su perseded by the establishment of a new religion But the brazen temple of Janus â was left standing in the forum of a size sufficient only to contain the statue of the god five cubits in height of a human form but with two faces directed to the east and west The double gates were likewise of brass and a fruitless effort to â turn them on their rusty hinges revealed the scandalous secret that some Romans â were still attached to the superstition of their ancestors Eighteen days were employed by the besiegers to provide all the instruments of attack which antiquity had invented Fascines were prepared to fill the ditches scaling ladders to ascend the walls The largest trees of the forest supplied the timbers of four battering rams their heads were armed with iron they were suspended by ropes and each of them was worked by the labour of fifty men The lofty wooden turrets moved on wheels or rollers and formed a spacious platform of the level of the rampart On the morning of the nineteenth day a general attack was made from the Prsnestine gate to the Vatican seven Go thic columns with their military engines advanced to the assault and the Rb mans who lined the ramparts listened with doubt and anxiety to the cheerful as surances of their commander As soon as the enemy approached the ditch Beli sarius himself drew the first arrow and such was his strength and dexterity that he transfixed the foremost of the barbarian leaders A shout of applause and victory was re echoed along the wall He drew a second arrow and the stroke was followed with the same success and the same acclamation The Roman general then gave the word that the archers should aim at the teams of oxen they were instan y covered with mortal wounds the towers which they drew remained use less and immoveable and a single moment disconcerted the laborious projects of the king of the Goths After this disappointment Vitiges still continued or feigned to continue the assault of the Salarian gate that he might divert the at tention of his adversary while his principal forces more strenuously attacked the Prscnestine gate and the sepulchre of Hadrian at the distance of three miles from each other Near the former the double walls of the Vivarium 4 were low or broken the fortifications of the latter were feebly guarded the vigour of the Goths was excited by the hope of victory and spoil and if a single post had given way the Romans and Rome itself were irrecoverably lost This perilous day was the most glorious in the life of Belisarius Amidst

changes of each instant weighed every possible advantage transported his person to the scenes of danger and communicated his spirit in calm and decisive orders The contest was fiercely maintained from the morning to the evening the Goths were repulsed on all sides and each Roman might boast that he had vanquished thirty barbarians if the strange disproportion of numbers were not counterba lanced by the merit of one man Thirty thousand Goths according to the con fession of their own chiefs perished in this bloody action and the multitude of the wounded was equal to that of the slain When they advanced to the assault their close disorder suffered not a javelin to fall without effect and as they retired the populace of the city joined the pursuit and slaughtered with impunity the backs of their flying enemies Belisarius instantly sallied from the gates and while the soldiers chanted his name and victory the hostile engines of war were reduced to ashes Such was the loss and consternation of the Goths that from this day the siege of Rome degenerated into a tedious and indolent blockade and they were in cessantly harassed by the Roman general who in frequent skirmishes destroyed above five thousand of their bravest troops Their cavalry was unpractised in the use of the bow their archers served on foot and this divided force was incapable of con tending with their adversaries whose lances and arrows at a distance or at hand were alike formidable The consummate skill of Belisarius embraced the favour able opportunities and as he chose the ground and the moment as he pressed the charge or sounded the retreat l the squadrons which he detached were seldom unsuccessful These partial advantages diffused an impatient ardour among the soldiers and people who began to feel the hardships of a siege and to disregard the dangers of a general engagement Each plebeian conceived himself to be a hero and the infantry who since the decay of discipline were rejected from the lineof battle aspired to the ancient honours of the Roman legion Belisarius praised the spirit of his troops condemned their presumption yielded to their cla mours and prepared the remedies of a defeat the possibility of which he alone had courage to suspect In the quarter of the Vatican the Romans prevailed and if the irreparable moments had not been wasted in the pillage of the camp they might have occupied the Milvian bridge and charged in the rear of the Gothic host On the other side of the Tiber Belisarius advanced from the Pincian and Salarian gates But his army four thousand soldiers perhaps was lost in a spa cious plain they were encompassed and oppressed by fresh jnultitudes who con tinually relieved the broken ranks of the barbarians The valiant leaders of the infantry were unskilled to conquer they died the retreat a hasty retreat was covered by the prudence of the general and the victors started back with affright from the formidable aspect of an armed rampart The reputation of Belisarius was unsullied by a defeat and the vain confidence of the Goths was not less ser viceable to his designs than the repentance and modesty of the Roman troops From the moment that Belisarius had determined to sustain a siege his assidu ous care provided Rome against the danger of famine more dreadful than the Go thic arms An extraordinary supply of corn was imported from Sicily the har vests of Campania and Tuscany were forcibly swept for the use of the city and the rights of private property were infringed by the strong plea of the public safe ty It might easily be foreseen that the enemy would intercept the aqueducts and the cessation of the water mills was the first inconvenience which was spee dily removed by mooring large vessels and fixing mill stones in the current of the river The stream was soon embarrassed by the trunks of trees and polluted with dead bodies yet so effectual were the precautions of the Roman general that the waters of the Tiber still continued to give motion to the mills and drink to the inhabitants the more distant quarters were supplied from domestic wells and a besieged city might support without impatience the privation of her public baths A large portion of Rome from the Pranestine gate to the church of St Paul was never invested by the Goths their excursions were restrained by the activity of the Moorish troops the navigation of the Tiber and the Latin Appian and Os tian ways were left free and unmolested for the introduction of corn and cattle or the retreat of the inhabitants who sought a refuge in Campania or Sicily Anx ious to relieve himself from a useless and devouring multitude Belisarius issued his peremptory orders for the instant departure of the women the children and 1 For the Roman trumpet and

and regulated their allowance that one moiety should be given in provisions and the other in money His foresight was justified by the increase of the public distress as soon as the Goths had occupied two rmportants posts in the neighbourhood of Rome by the loss of the port or as it is now called the city of Porto he was de prived of the country on the right of the Tiber and the best communication with the sea and he reflected with grief and anger that three hundred men could he have spared such a feeble band might have defended its impregnable works Seven miles from the capital between the Appian and the Latin ways two prin cipal aqueducts crossing and again crossing each other enclosed within their solid and lofty arches a fortified space 1 where Vitiges established a camp of seven thousand Goths to intercept the convoys of Sicily and Campania The granaries of Rome were insensibly exhausted the adjacent country had been wasted with fire and sword and such scanty supplies as might yet be obtained by hasty excursions were the reward of valour and the purchase of wealth the forage of the horses and the bread of the soldiers never failed but in the last months of the siege the people were exposed to the miseries of scarcity unwholesome food 2 and con tagious disorders Belisarius saw and pitied their sufferings but he had foreseen and he watched the decay of their loyalty and the progress of their discontent Adversity had awakened the Romans from the dreams of grandeur and freedom and taught them the humiliating lesson that it was of small moment to their real happiness whether the name of their master was derived from the Gothic or the Latin language The lieutenant of Justinian listened to their just complaints but he rejected with disdain the idea of flight or capitulation repressed their clamo rous impatience for battle amused them with the prospect of sure and speedy relief and secured himself and the city from the effects of their despair or trea chery Twice in each month he changed the station of the officers to whom the custody of the gates was committed the various precautions of patroles watch words lights and music were repeatedly employed to discover whatever passed on the rampafts out guards were posted beyond the ditch and the trusty vigilance of dogs supplied the more doubtful fidelity of mankind A letter was intercepted which assured the king of the Goths that the Asinarian gate adjoining to the La teran church should be secretly opened to his troops On the proof of suspicion of treason several senators were banished and the pope Sylverius was summoned to attend the representative of his sovereign at his head quarters in the Pincian palace 3 The ecclesiastics who followed their bishop were detained in the first or second apartment 4 and he alone was admitted to the presence of Belisarius Uhe conqueror of Rome and Carthage was modestly seated at the feet of Antonina who reclined on a stately couch the general was silent but the voice of reproach and menace issued from the mouth of his imuerious wife Accused by credible witnesses and the evidence of his own subscription the successor of St Peter was despoiled of his pontifical ornaments clad in a mean habit of a monk and embarked without delay for a distant exile in the east At the emperor s com mand the clergy of Rome proceeded to the choice of a new bishop and after a solemn invocation of the Holy Ghost elected the deacon Vigilius who had pur chased the papal throne by a bribe of two hundred pounds of gold The profit and consequently the guilt of this simony was imputed to Belisarius but the hero obeyed the orders of his wife Antonina served the passions of the empress and Theodora lavished her treasures in the vain hope of obtaining a pontiff hostile or indifferent to the council of Chalcedon 5 1 Proeopjui Goth lib ii c 3 has forgot to name these aqueducts nor can such a double intersection at such a distance from Rome be clearly

reign Perhaps that reign would have been equally prosperous if the peaceful master of the east had abstained from the con quest of Africa and Italy but as Justinian was ambitious of fame he made some efforts they were feeble and languid to support and rescue his victorious general A re enforcement of sixteen hundred Sclavonians and Huns was led by Martin and Valerian and as they had reposed during the winter season in the harbours of Greece the strength of the men and horses was not impaired by the fatigues of a sea voyage and they distinguished their valour in the first sally against the besie gers About the time of the summer solstice Euthalius landed at Terracina with large sums of money for the payment of the troops he cautiously proceeded along the Appian way and this convoy entered Rome through the gateCapena l while Belisarius on the other side diverted the attention of the Goths by a vigorous and successful skirmish These seasonable aids the use and reputation of which were dexterously managed by the Roman general revived the courage or at least the hopes of the soldiers and people The historian Procopius was despatched with an important commission to collect the troops and provisions which Campania could furnish or Constantinople had sent and the secretary of Belisarius was soon followed by Antonina herself 2 who boldly traversed the posts of the enemy and returned with the oriental succours to the relief of her husband and the besieged city A fleet of three thousand Isaurians cast anchor in the bay of Naples and afterward at Ostia Above two thousand horse of whom a part were Thracians landed at Tarentum and after the junction of five hundred soldiers of Campania and a train of wagons laden with wine and flour they directed their march on the Appian way from Capua to the neighbourhood of Rome The forces that ar rived by land and sea were united at the mouth of the Tiber Antonina convened a council of war it was resolved to surmount with sails and oars the adverse stream of the river and the Goths were apprehensive of disturbing by any rash hostili ties the negotiation to which Belisarius had craftily listened They credulously believed that they saw no more than the vanguard of a fleet and army which al ready covered the Ionian sea and the plains of Campania and the illusion was supported by the haughty language of the Roman general when he gave audience to the ambassadors of Vitiges After a specious discourse to vindicate the justice of his cause they declared that for the sake of peace they were disposed to re nounce the possession of Sicily  The emperor is not less generous replied his lieutenant with a disdainful smile  in return for a gift which you no longer pos sess he presents you with an ancient province of the empireâ he resigns to the Goths the sovereignty of the British island Belisarius rejected with equal firm ness and contempt the offer of a tribute but he allowed the Gothic ambassadors to seek their fate from the mouth of Justinian himself and consented with seeming reluctance to a truce of three months from the winter solstice to the equinox of spring Prudence might not safely trust either the oaths or hostages of the bar barians but the conscious superiority of the Roman chief was expressed in the distribution of his troops As soon as fear or hunger compelled the Goths to eva cuate Alba Porto and Centumcella their place was instantly supplied the gar risons of Narni Spoleto and Perusia were re enforced and the seven camps of the besiegers were gradually encompassed with the calamities of a siege The 1 The old Capena was removed by Aurelian to or near the modern gate of St Sebastian see Nolli s plan That memorable spot hat been consecrated by the Egerian grove the memory of Numa

against her Arian tyrant At the same time John the Sanguinary 1 the nephew of Vitalian was detached with two thousand chosen horse first to Alba on the Fucine lake and afterward to the frontiers of Picenum on the Hadriatic sea  la â that province said Belisarius  the Goths have deposited their families and trea sures without a guard or the suspicion of danger Doubtless they will violate the truce let them feel your presence before they hear of your motions Spare the Italians suffer not any fortified places to remain hostile in your rear and faithfully reserve the spoil for an equal and common partition It would not be reasonable he added with a laugh that whilst we are toiling to the destruction of the drones our more fortunate brethren should rifle and enjoy the honey The whole nation of the Ostrogoths had been assembled for the attack and was almost entirely consumed in the siege of Rome If any credit be due to an intelli gent spectator one third at least of their enormous host was destroyed in frequent and bloody combats under the walls of the city The bad fame and pernicious qualities of the summer air might already be imputed to the decay of agriculture and population and the evils of famine and pestilence were aggravated by their own licentiousness and the unfriendly disposition of the country While Vitiges struggled with his fortune while he hesitated between shame and ruin his retreat was hastened by domestic alarms The king of the Goths was informed by trem bling messengers that John the Sanguinary spread the devastations of war from the Apennine to the Hadriatic that the rich spoils and innumerable captives of Picenum were lodged in the fortifications of Rimini and that this formidable chief had defeated his uncle insulted his capital and seduced by secret correspondence the fidelity of his wife the imperious daughter of Amalasontha Yet before her retired Vitiges made a last effort either to storm or to surprise the city A secret passage was discovered in one of the aqueducts two citizens of the Vatican were tempted by bribes to intoxicate the guards of the Aurelian gate an attack was meditated on the walls beyond the Tiber in a place which was not fortified with towers and the barbarians advanced with torches and scaling ladders to the as sault of the Pincian gate But every attempt was defeated by the intrepid vigi lance of Belisarius and his band of veterans who in the most perilous moments did not regret the absence of their companions and the Goths alike destitute of hope and subsistence clamorously urged their departure before the truce should expire and the Roman cavalry should again be united One year and nine days after the commencement of the siege an army so lately strong and triumphant burnt their tents and tumultuously repassed the Milvian bridge They repassed not with impunity their thronging multitudes oppressed in a narrow passage were driven headlong into the Tiber by their own fears and the pursuit of the ene my and the Roman general sallying from the Pincian gate inflicted a severe and disgraceful wound on their retreat The slow length of a sickly and desponding host was heavily dragged along the Flaminian way from whence the barbarians were sometimes compelled to deviate lest they should encounter the hostile garri sons that guarded the high road to Rimini and Ravenna Yet so powerful was this flying army that Vitiges spared ten thousand men for the defence of the cities which he was most solicitous to preserve and detached his nephew Uraias with an adequate force for the chastisement of rebellious Milan At the head of his principal army he besieged Rimini only thirty three miles distant from the Go thic capital A feeble rampart and a shallow ditch were maintained by the skill and valour of John the Sanguinary who shared the danger and fatigue of the mean est soldier and emulated on a theatre less illustrious the military virtues of his great commander The towers and battering engines of the barbarians were ren dered useless their attacks were repulsed and the tedious blockade which re duced the garrison to the last extremity of hunger afforded time for the union and march of the Roman forces A fleet which had surprised Ancona sailed along the coast of the Hadriatic to the relief of the besieged city The eunuch Narses landed in Picenum with two thousand Heruli and five thousand of the bravest troops of the east The rock of the Appennine was forced ten thousand veterans moved round the foot of the mountains under the command of Belisarius himself and a new army whose encampment blazed with innumerable lights afifieared to advance along the Flaminian way Overwhelmed with astonishment and despair 0 Anastasias p 49 has preserved this rpithct of SMieuinaiius which might do honour to a tiger OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 63 tiie Goths abandoned the siege of Rimini their tents their standards and their leaders and Vitiges who gave or followed the example of flight never halted till he found a shelter within the walls and morasses of Ravenna To these walls and to some fortresses destitute of any mutual support the Go thic monarchy was now reduced The provinces of Italy had embraced the party of the emperor and his army gradually recruited to the number of twenty thou sand men must have achieved an easy and rapid conquest if their invincible powers had not been weakened by the discord of the Roman chiefs Before the end of the siege an act of blood ambiguous and indiscreet sullied the fair fame of Belisarius Presidius a loyal Italian as he fled from Ravenna to Rome was rude ly stopped by Constantine the military governor of Spoleto and despoiled even in a church of two daggers richly inlaid with gold and precious stones As soon as the public danger had subsided Presidius complained of the loss and injury his complaint was heard but the order of restitution was disobeyed by the pride and avarice of the offender Exasperated by the delay Presidius boldly arrested the general s horse as he passed through the forum and with the spirit of a citizen demanded the common benefit of the Roman laws The honour of Belisarius was engaged he summoned a council claimed the obedience of his subordinate officer and was provoked by an insolent reply to call hastily for the presence of his guards Constantine viewing their entrance as the signal of death drew his sword and rushed on the general who nimbly eluded the stroke and was protect ed by his friends while the desperate assassin was disarmed dragged into a neigh bouring chamber and executed or rather murdered by the guards at the arbi trary command of Belisarius 1 In this hasty act of violence the guilt of Con stantine was no longer remembered the despair and death of that valiant officer were secretly imputed to the revenge of Antonina and each of his colleagues con scious of the same rapine was apprehensive of the same fate The fear of a com mon enemy suspended the effects of their envy and discontent but in the confidence of approaching victory they instigated a powerful rival to oppose the conqueror â of Rome and Africa From the domestic service of the palace and the adminis tration of the private revenue Narses the eunuch was suddenly exalted to the head of an army and the spirit of a hero who afterwards equalled the merit and â glory of Belisarius served only to perplex the operations of the Gothic war To his prudent counsels the relief of Rimini was ascribed by the leaders of the dis contented faction who exhorted Narses to assume an independent and separate command The epistle of Justinian had indeed enjoined his obedience to the gene ral but the dangerous exception as far as may be advantageous to the fiublic ser vice reserved some freedom of judgment to the discreet favourite who had so late ly departed from the sacred and familiar conversation of his sovereign In the exercise of this doubtful right the eunuch perpetually dissented from the opinions of Belisarius and after yielding with reluctance to the siege of Urbino he desert ed his colleague in the night and marched away to the conquest of the JEmilian province The fierce and formidable bands of the Heruli were attached to the person of Narses 2 ten thousand Romans and confederates were persuaded to march under his banners every malecontent embraced the fair opportunity of re vengine his private or imaginary wrongs and the remaining troops of Belisarius were divided and dispersed from the garrisons of Sicily to the shores of the Hadri atic His skill and perseverance overcame every obstacle Urbino was taken the sieges of Fassulac Orvieto and Auximum were undertaken and vigorously prose cuted and the eunuch Narses was at length recalled to the domestic cares of the palace All dissensions were healed and all opposition was subdued by the tem perate authority of the Roman general to whom his enemies could not refuse their esteem and Belisarius inculcated the salutary lessons that the forces of the state should compose one body and be animated by one soul But in the interval of discord the Goths were permitted to breathe an important season was lost Milan was destroyed and the northern provinces of Italy were afflicted by an inundation of the Franks 1 The transaction is related in the public history Goth lib ii c 8 with candour or caution in the An

ii c 14 15 7 THE DECLINE AND FALL When Justinian first meditated the conquest of Italy he sent ambassadors to the kings of the Franks and adjured them by the common ties of alliance and religion to join in the holy enterprise against the Arians The Goths as their wants were more urgent employed a more effectual mode of persuasion and vainly strove by the gift of lands and money to purchase the friendship or at least the neutrality of a light and perfidious nation 1 But the arms of Belisarius and the revolt of the Italians had no sooner shaken the Gothic monarchy than Theodebert of Aus tralia the most powerful and warlike of the Merovingian kings was persuaded to succour their distress by an indirect and seasonable aid Without expecting the consent of their sovereign ten thousand Burgundians his recent subjects descend ed from the Alps and joined the troops which Vitiges had sent to chastise the re volt of Milan After an obstinate siege the capital of Liguria was reduced by fa mine but no capitulation could be obtained except for the safe retreat of the Ro man garrison Datius the orthodox bishop who had seduced his countrymen to rebellion 2 and ruin escaped to the luxury and honours of the Byzantine court 3 but the clergy perhaps the Arian clergy were slaughtered at the foot of their own altars by the defenders of the catholic faith Three hundred thousand males were reported to be slain 4 the female sex and the more precious spoil was resigned to the Burgundians and the houses or at least the walls of Milan were levelled with the ground The Goths in their last moments were revenged by the des truction of a city second only to Rome in size and opulence in the splendour of its buildings or the number of its inhabitants and Belisarius sympathized alone in the fate of his deserted and devoted friends Encouraged by this successful inroad Theodebert himself in the ensuing spring invaded the plains of Italy with an ar my of one hundred thousand barbarians 5 The king and some chosen followers were mounted on horseback and armed with lances the infantry without bows or spears were satisfied with a shield a sword and a double edged battle axe which in their hands became a deadly and unerring weapon Italy trembled at the march of the Franks and both the Gothic prince and the Roman general alike ignorant of their designs solicited with hope and terror the friendship of these dangerous allies Till he had secured the passage of the Po on the bridge of Pa via the grandson of Clovis dissembled his intentions which he at length declared by assaulting almost at the same instant the hostile camps of the Romans and Goths Instead of uniting their arms they fled with equal precipitation and the fertile though desolate provinces of Liguria and JEmilia were abandoned to a li centious host of barbarians whose rage was not mitigated by any thoughts of set tlement or conquest Among the cities which they ruined Genoa not yet con structed of marble is particularly enumerated and the deaths of thousands ac cording to the regular practice of war appear to have excited less horror than some idolatrous sacrifices of women and children which were performed with im punity in the camp of the most Christian king If it were not a melancholy truth that the first and most cruel sufferings must be the lot of the innocent and helpless history might exult in the misery of the conquerors who in the midst of riches were left destitute of bread or wine reduced to drink the waters of the Po and to feed on the flesh of distempered cattle The dysentery swept away one third of their army and the clamours of his subjects who were impatient to pass the Alps disposed Theodebert to listen with respect to the mild exhortation of Belisarius The memory of this inglorious and destructive warfare was perpetuated on the medals of Gaul and Justinian without unsheathing his sword assumed the title of conqueror of the Franks The Merovingian prince was offended by the vanity of the emperor he affected to pity the fallen fortunes of the Goths and his insidious offer of a federal union was fortified by the promise or menace of descending from the Alps

forests As soon as Belisarius was delivered from his foreign and domestic enemies he seriously applied his forces to the final reduction of Italy Jn the siege of Osimo the general was nearly transpierced with an arrow if the mortal stroke had not been intercepted by one of his guards who lost in that pious office the use of his hand The Goths of Osimo four thousand warriors witn those of Ficsulx and the Cottian Alps were among the last who maintained their independence and their gallant resistance which almost tired the patience deserved the esteem of the conqueror His prudence refused to subscribe the safe conduct which they asked to join their brethren of Ravenna but they saved by an honourable capitulation one moiety at least of their wealth with the free alternative of retiring peaceably to their estates or enlisting to serve the emperor in his Persian wars The mul titudes which yet adhered to the standard of Vitiges far surpassed the number of the Roman troops but neither prayers nor defiance nor the extreme danger of his most faithful subjects could tempt the Gothic king beyond the fortifications of Ravenna These fortifications were indeed impregnable to the assaults of art or violence and when Belisarius invested the capital he was soon convinced that famine only could tame the stubborn spirit of the barbarians The sea the land and the channels of the Po were guarded by the vigilance of the Roman general and his morality extended the rights of war to the practice of poisoning the waters 4 and secretly firing the granaries S of a besieged city fi While he pressed the blockade of Ravenna he was surprised by the arrival of two am bassadors from Constantinople with a treaty of peace which Justinian had im prudently signed without deigning to consult the author of his victory By this disgraceful and precarious agreement Italy and the Gothic treasure were divided and the provinces beyond the Po were left with the regal title to the successor of Theodoric The ambassadors were eager to accomplish their salutary commis sion the captive Vitiges accepted with trausport the unexpected offer of a crown honour was less prevalent among the Goths than the want and appetite of food and the Roman chiefs who murmured at the continuance of the war professed implicit submission to the commands of the emperor If Belisarius had possessed only the courage of a soldier the laurel would have been snatched from his hand by timid and envious counsels but in this decisive moment he resolved with the magnanimity of a statesman to sustain alone the danger and merit of generous disobedience Each of his officers gave a written opinion that the siege of Ra venna was impracticable and hopeless the general then rejected the treaty of partition and declared his own resolution of leading Vitiges in chains to the feet of Justinian The Goths retired with doubt and dismay this peremptory refusal deprived them of the only signature which they could trust and filled their minds â with a just apprehension that a sagacious enemy had discovered the full extent of their deplorable state They compared the fame and fortune of Belisarius with the weakness of their ill fated king and the comparison suggested an extraordi nary project to which Vitiges with apparent resignation was compelled to acqui esce Partition would ruin the strength exile would

Italy If the false lustre of a diadem could have tempted the loyalty of a faithful subject his pru dence must have foreseen the inconstancy of the barbarians and his rational am bition would prefer the safe and honourable station of a Roman general Even the patience and seeming satisfaction with which he entertained a proposal of trea son might be susceptible of a malignant interpretation But the lieutenant of Justinian was conscious of his own rectitude he entered into a dark and crooked path as it might lead to the voluntary submission of the Goths and his dexterous policy persuaded them that he was disposed to comply with their wishes without engaging an oath or a promise for the performance of a treaty which he secretly abhorred The day of the surrender of Ravenna was stipulated by the Gothic ambassadors a fleet laden with provisions sailed as a welcome guest into the deepest recess of the harbour the gates were opened to the fancied king of Italy and Belisarius without meeting an enemy triumphantly marched through the streets of an impregnable city l The Romans were astonished by their suc cess the multitude of tall and robust barbarians were confounded by the image of their own patience and the masculine females spitting in the faces of their sons and husbands most bitterly reproached them for betraying their dominion and freedom to these pigmies of the south contemptible in their numbers diminutive in their stature Before the Goths could recover from their first surprise and claim the accomplishment of their doubtful hopes the victor established his power in Ravenna beyond the danger of repentance and revolt Vitiges who perhaps had attempted to escape was honourably guarded in his palace 2 the flower of the Gothic youth was selected for the service of the emperor the remainder of the people was dismissed to their peaceful habitations in the southern provinces and a colony of Italians was invited to replenish the depopulated city The submission of the capital was imitated in the towns and villages of Italy which had not been subdued or even visited by the Romans and the independent Goths who re mained in arms at Pavia and Verona were ambitious only to become the subjects of Belisarius But his inflexible loyalty rejected except as the substitute of Jus tinian their oaths of allegiance and he was not offended by the reproach of their deputies that he rather chose to be a slave than a king After the second victory of Belisarius envy again whispered Justinian listened and the hero was recalled  The remnant of the Gothic war was no longer wor thy of his presence agracioussovereign was impatient to reward his services and to consult his wisdom and he alone was capable of defending the east against the innumerable armies of Persia Belisarius understood the suspicion accepted the excuse embarked at Ravenna his spoils and trophies and proved by his ready obedience that such an abrupt removal from the government of Italy was not less unjust than it might have been indiscreet The emperor received with honoura ble courtesy both Vitiges and his more noble consort and as the king of the Goths conformed to the Athanasian faith he obtained with a rich inheritance of lands in Asia the rank of senator and patrician 3 Every spectator admired without peril the strength and stature of the young barbarians they adored the strength and majesty of the throne and promised to shed their blood in the service of their benefactor Justinian deposited in the Byzantine palace the treasures of the Go thic monarchy A flattering senate was sometimes admitted to gaze on the mag nificent spectacle but it was enviously secluded from the public view and the conqueror of Italy renounced without a murmur perhaps without a sigh the well earned honours of a second triumph His glory was indeed exalted above all ex ternal pomp and the faint and hollow praises of the court were supplied even in a servile age by the respect and admiration of his country

and the martial train which attended his footsteps left his person more accessible than in a day of battle Seven thou sand horsemen matchless for beauty and valour were maintained in the service â and at the private expense of the general l Their prowess was always con spicuous in single combats or in the foremost ranks and both parties confessed that in the siege of Rome the guards of Belisarius had alone vanquished the bar barian host Their numbers were continually augmented by the bravest and most faithful of the enemy and his fortunate captives the Vandals the Moors and the Goths emulated the attachment of his domestic followers By the union of libe rality and justice he acquired the love of the soldiers without alienating the af fections of the people The sick and wounded were relieved with medicines and money and still more efficaciously by the healing visits and smiles of their com mander The loss of a weapon or a horse was instantly repaired and each deed of valour was rewarded by the rich and honourable gifts of a bracelet or a collar which were rendered more precious by the judgment of Belisarius He was en deared to the husbandmen by the peace and plenty which they enjoyed under the shadow of his standard Instead of being injured the country was enriched by the inarch of the Roman armies and such was the rigid discipline of their camp that not an apple was gathered from the tree not a path could be traced in the fields of corn Belisarius was chaste and sober In the license of a military life none could boast that they had seen him intoxicated with wine the most beautiful cap tives of Gothic or Vandal race were offered to his embraces but he turned aside from their charms and the husband of Antonina was never suspected of violating the laws of conjugal fidelity The spectator and historian of his exploits has ob served that amidst the perils of war he was daring without rashness prudent without fear slow or rapid according to the exigencies of the moment that in the deepest distress he was animated by real or apparent hope but that he was mo dest and humble in the most prosperous fortune By these virtues he equalled or excelled the ancient masters of the military art Victory by sea and land at tended his arms He subdued Africa Italy and the adjacent islands led away cap tives the successors of Genseric and Theodoric filled Constantinople with the spoils of their palaces and in the space of six years recovered half the provinces of the western empire In his fame and merit in wealth and power he remained with out a rival the first of the Roman subjects the voice of envy could only magnify his dangerous importance and the emperor might applaud his own discerning spi rit which had discovered and raised the genius of Belisarius It was the custom of the Roman triumphs that a slave should be placed behind the chariot to remind the conqueror of the instability of fortune and the infirmi ties of human nature Procopius in his Anecdotes has assumed that servile and ungrateful office The generous reader may cast away the libel but the evidence of facts will adhere to his memory and he will reluctantly confess that the fame and even the virtue of Belisarius were polluted by the lust and cruelty of his wife and that the hero deserved an appellation which may not drop from the pen of the decent historian The mother of Antonina 2 was a theatrical prostitute and both her father and grandfather exercised at Thessalonica and Constantinople the vile though lucrative profession of charioteers In the various situations of their for tune she became the companion the enemy the sen ant and the favourite of the empress Theodora these loose and ambitious females had been connected by si milar pleasures they were separated by the jealousy of vice and at length re conciled by the partnership of guilt Before her marriage with Belisarius An â tonina had one husband and many lovers Phothis the son of her former nuptials was

the shores of Africa this holy kindred degenerated into sensual love and as Antonina1 soon overleaped the bounds of modesty arid caution the Roman general was alone ig norant of his own dishonour During their residence at Carthage he surprised the two lovers in a subterraneous chamber solitary warm and almost naked Anger flashed from his eyes With the helfi of this young man said the unblushing Antonina Iiuas secreting our most precious effects from the knowledge of Justi nian The youth resumed his garments and the pious husband consented to dis believe the evidence of his own senses From this pleasing and perhaps volunta ry delusion Belisarius was awakened at Syracuse by the officious information of Macedonia and that female attendant after requiring an oath for her security produced two chamberlains who like herself had often beheld the adulteries of Antonina A hasty flight into Asia saved Theodosius from the justice of an in jured husband who had signified to one of his guards the order of his death but the tears of Antonina and her artful seduction assured the credulous hero of her innocence and he stooped against his faith and judgment to abandon those im prudent friends who had presumed to accuse or doubt the chastity of his wife The revenge of a guilty woman is implacable and bloody the unfortunate Mace donia with the two witnesses were secretly arrested by the minister of her cru elty their tongues were cut out their bodies were hacked into small pieces and their remains were cast into the sea of Syracuse A rash though judicious say ing of Constantino I would sooner have punished the adultress than the boy was deeply remembered by Antonina and two years afterward when despair had armed that officer against his general her sanguinary advice decided and hastened his execution Even the indignation of Photius was not forgiven by his mother the exile of her son prepared the recall of her lover and Theodosius condescend ed to accept the pressing and humble invitation of the conqueror of Italy In the absolute direction of his household and in the important commissions of peace and war 2 the favourite youth most rapidly acquired a fortune of four hundred thou sand pounds sterling and after their return to Constantinople the passion of An tonina at least continued ardent and unabated But fear devotion and lassitude perhaps inspired Theodosius with more serious thoughts He dreaded the busy scandal of the capital and the indiscreet fondness of the wife of Belisarius es caped from her embraces and retiring to Ephesus shaved his head and took re fuge in the sanctuary of a monastic life The despair of the new Ariadne could scarcely have been excused by the death of her husband She wept she tore her hair she filled the palace with her cries  she had lost the dearest of friends a tender a faithful a laborious friend But her warm entreaties fortified by the prayers of Belisarius were insufficient to draw the holy monk from the solitude of Ephesus It was not till the general moved forward for the Persian war that Theodosius could be tempted to return to Constantinople and the short interval before the departure of Antonina herself was boldly devoted to love and pleasure A philosopher may pity and forgive the infirmities of female nature from which he receives no real injury but contemptible is the husband who feels and yet en dures his own infamy in that of his wife Antonina pursued her son with impla cable hatred and the gallant Photius 3 was exposed to her secret persecutions ill the camp beyond the Tigris Enraged by his own wrongs and by the dishonour of his blood he castaway in his turn the sentiments of nature and revealed to Belisa rius the turpitude of a woman who Uad violated all the duties of a mother and a wife From the surprise and indignation of the Roman general his former credulity ap pears to have been sincere he embraced the knees of the son of Antonina adjured him to remember his obligations rather than his birth and confirmed at the altar their holy vows of revenge and mutual defence The dominion of Antonina was impaired by absence and when she met her husband on his return from the Per sian confines Belisarius in his first and transient emotions confined her person 1 Compare the Vandalic War lib i c 12 with ilic Anecdoler c l and Alemannus p 2 3 Thft mode of

mother the full confession of her guilt arrested Theodosius and his treasures in the church of St John the apostle and concealed his captives whose execution was only de layed in a secure and sequestered fortress of Cilicia Such a daring outrage against public justice could not pass with impunity and the cause of Antonina was espoused by the empress whose favour she had deserved by the recent services of the dis grace of a prefect and the exile and murder of a pope At the end of the cam paign Belisarius was recalled he complied as usual with the imperial mandate His mind was not prepared for rebellion his obedience however adverse to the dic tates of honour was consonant to the wishes of his heart and when he embraced his â wife at the command and perhaps in the presence of the empress the tender hus band was disposed to forgive or to be forgiven The bounty of Theodora reserved for her companion a more precious favour  I have found she said my dearest patrician a pearl of inestimable value it has not yet been viewed by any mortal eye but the sight and the possession of this jewel are destined for my friend As soon as the curiosity and impatience of Antonina were kindled the door of a bed chamber was thrown open and she beheld her lover whom the diligence of the eunuchs had discovered in his secret prison Her silent wonder burst into pas sionate exclamations of gratitude and joy and she named Theodora her queen her benefactress and her saviour The monk of Ephesus was nourished in the pa lace with luxury and ambition but instead of assuming as he was promised the command of the Roman armies Theodosius expired in the first fatigues of an amo rous interview The grief of Antonina could only be assuaged by the sufferings of her son A youth of consular rank and sickly constitution was punished without a trial like a malefactor and a slave yet such was the constancy of his mind that Photius sustained the tortures of the scourge and the rack without violating the faith which he had sworn to Belisarius After this fruitless cruelty the son of An tonina while his mother feasted with the empress was buried in her subterraneous prisons which admitted not the distinction of night and day He twice escaped to the venerable sanctuaries of Constantinople the churches of St Sophia and of the Virgin but his tyrants were as insensible of religion as of pity and the helpless youth amidst the clamours of the clergy and people was twice dragged from the altar to the dungeon His third attempt was more successful At the end of three years the prophet Zacharia or some mortal friend indicated the means of an es cape he eluded the spies and guards of the empress reached the holy sepulchre of Jerusalem embraced the profession of a monk and the abbot Photius was em ployed after the death of Justinian to reconcile and regulate the churches of Egypt The son of Antonina suffered all that an enemy can inflict her patient husband imposed on himself the more exquisite misery of violating his promise and desert ing his friend In the succeeding campaign Belisarius was again sent against the Persians he saved the east but he oftended Theodora and perhaps the emperor himself The malady of Justinian had countenanced the rumour of his death and the Roman ge neral on the supposition of that probable event spoke the free language of a citizen and a soldier His colleague Buzes who concurred in the same sentiments lost his rank his liberty and his health by the persecution of the empress but the dis grace o Belisarius was alleviated by the dignity of his own character and the in Huence of his wife who might wish to humble but could not desire to ruin the partner of her fortunes Even this removal was coloured by the assurance that the sinking state of Italy would be retrieved by the single presence of the conquer or Bjit no sooner had he returned alone and defenceless than a hostile commis sion was sent to the east to seize his treasures and criminate his actions the guards and veterans who followed his private banner were distributed among the chiefs of the army and even the eunuchs presumed to cast lots for the partition of his martial domestics When he passed with a small and sordid retinue through the streets of Constantinople his forlorn appearance extited the amazement and com passion of the people Justinian and Theodora received him with cold ingratitude the servile crowd with insolence and contempt and in the evening he retired with trembling steps to his deserted palace An indisposition feigned or real had con fined Antonina to her apartment and she walked disdainfully silent in the adjacent portico while Belisarius threw himself on his bed and expected in an agony of grief and terror the death which he had so often braved under the walls of Rome Long after sunset a messenger was announced from the empress he opened with TO THE DECLINE AND FALL anxious curiosity the letter which contained the sentence of his fate  You can not be ignorant how much you have deserved my displeasure I am not insensi ble of the services of Antonina To her merits and intercession I have granted your life and permit you to retain a part of your treasures which might be justly forfeited to the state Let your gratitude where it is due be displayed not in words but in your future behaviour I know not how to believe or to relate the transports which the hero is said to have received this ignominious pardon He fell prostrate before his wife he kissed the feet of his saviour and he devoutly pro mised to live the grateful and submissive slave of Antonina A fine of one hundred and twenty thousand pounds sterling Was levied on the fortunes of Belisarius and with the office of count or master of the royal stable he accepted the conduct of the Italian war At his departure from Constantinople his friends and even the public were persuaded that as soon as he regained his freedom he would renounce his dissimulation and that his wife Theodora and perhaps the emperor himself would be sacrificed to the just revenge of a virtuous rebel Their hopes were de ceived and the unconquerable patience and loyalty of Belisarius appear either be low or above the character of a man 1 CHAPTER XLII SUUe of the Barbaric world â Establishment of the Lombards on the Danube â Tribes and  inroads of the Sclavonians â

real elevation as by the height to which they as cend above the level of their age or country and the same stature which in a people of giants would pass unnoticed must appear conspicuous in a race of pigmies Leonidas and his three hundred companions devoted their lives at Thermopylse but the education of the infant the boy and the man had prepared and almost ensured this memorable sacrifice and

had defeated in battle two millions of enemies and reduced fifteen hundred ci ties from the lake Mseotis to the Red Sea 3 but the fortune of Rome flew before his eagles the nations were oppressed by their own fears and the invincible le gions which he commanded had been formed by the habits of conquest and the discipline of ages In this view the character of Belisarius may be deservedly placed above the heroes of the ancient republics His imperfections flowed from the contagion of the times his virtues were his own the free gift of nature or re flection he raised himself without a master or a rival and so inadequate were the arms committed to his hand that his sole advantage was derived from the pride and presumption of his adversaries Under his command the subjects of Justinian often deserved to be called Romans but the unwarlike appellation of Greeks was imposed as a term of reproach by the haughty Goths who affected to blush that they might dispute the kingdom of Italy with a nation of tragedians pantomimes andpirates 4 The climate of Asia has indeed been found less congenial than that of Europe to military spirit those populous Countries were enervated by luxury despotism

it may seem was thinly scattered over the sea and land in Spain and Italy in Africa and Egypt on the banks of the Danube the coast of the Euxine and the frontiers of Persia The citizen was exhausted yet the soldier was unpaid his poverty was mischievously soothed by the privilege of rapine and indolence and the tardy pay ments were detained and intercepted by the fraud of those agents who usurp with out courage or danger the emoluments of war Public and private distress re cruited the armies of the state but in the field and still more in the presence of the enemy their numbers were always defective The want of national spirit was supplied by the precarious faith and disorderly service of barbarian mercenaries Even military honour which has often survived the loss of virtue and freedom was almost totally extinct The generals who were multiplied beyond the example of former times laboured only to prevent the success or to sully the reputation of their colleagues and they had been taught by experience that if merit sometimes pro voked the jealousy error or even guilt would obtain the indulgence of a gracious emperor 1 In such an age the triumphs of Belisarius and afterward of Narses shine with incomparable lustre but they are encompassed with the darkest shades of disgrace and calamity While the lieutenant of Justinian subdued the kingdoms of the Goths and Vandals the emperor 2 timid though ambitious balanced the forces of the barbarians fomented their divisions by flattery and falsehood and in vited by his patience and liberality the repetition of injuries 3 The keys of Car thage Rome and Ravenna were presented to their conqueror while Antioch was destroyed by the Persians and Justinian trembled for the safety of Constanti nople Even the Gothic victories of Belisarius were prejudicial to the state since they abolished the important barrier of the Upper Danub which had been so faithful evacuated Pannonia and Noricum which they left in a peaceful and flourishing condition the sovereignty was claimed by the emperor of the Romans the actual Possession was abandoned to the boldness of the first invader On the opposite anks of the Danube the plains of Upper Hungary and the Transylvanian hills were possessed since the death of Attila by the tribes of the Gepids who re spected the Gothic arms and despised not indeed the gold of the Romans but the secret motive of their annual subsidies The vacant fortifications of the river were instantly occupied by these barbarians their standards were planted on the walls of Sirmium and Belgrade and the ironical tone of their apology aggravated this insult on the majesty of the empire  So extensive O Cssar are your do minions so numerous are your cities that you are continually seeking for nations to whom either in peace or war you may relinquish these useless possessions The Gepidrc are your brave and faithful allies and if they have anticipated your gifts they have shown a just confidence in your bounty Their presumption was excused by the mode of revenge which Justinian embraced Instead of asserting the rights of a sovereign for the protection of his subjects the emperor invited a strange people to invade and possess the Roman provinces between the Danube and the Alps and the ambition of the Gepidai was checked by the rising power and fame of the Lombards 4 This corrupt appellation has been diffused in the thirteenth century by the merchants and bankers the Italian posterity of these savage warriors but the original name of Langobards is expressive only of the pe

Oder Fierce beyond the example of the Germans they delighted to propagate the tre mendous belief that their heads were formed like the heads of dogs and that they drank the blood of their enemies whom they vanquished in battle The smallness of their numbers was recruited by the adoption of their bravest slaves and alone amidst their powerful neighbours they defended by arms their high spirited inde pendence In the tempests of the north which overwhelmed so many names and nations this little bark of the Lombards still floated on the surface they gradually descended towards the south and the Danube and at the end of four hundred years they again appear with their ancient valour and renown Their manners were not less ferocious The assassination of a royal guest was executed in the pre sence and by the command of the king s daughter who had been provoked by some words of insult and disappointed by his diminutive stature and a tribute the price of blood was imposed on the Lombards by his brother the king of the He ruli Adversity revived a sense of moderation and justice and the insolence of conquest was chastised by the signal defeat and irreparable dispersion of the Heru li who were seated in the southern provinces of Poland l The victories of the Lombards recommended them to the friendship of the emperors and at the soli citation of Justinian they passed the Danube to reduce according to their treaty the cities of Noricum and the fortresses of Pannonia But the spirit of rapine soon tempted them beyond these ample limits they wandered along the coast of the Hadriatic as far as Dyrrachium and presumed with familiar rudeness to enter the towns and houses of their Roman allies and to seize the captives who had es caped from their audacious hands These acts of hostility the sallies as it might be pretended of some loose adventurers were disowned by the nation and excused by the emperor but the arms of the Lombards were more seriously engaged by a contest

barbarians were almost equally odious renounced a partial and ambiguous sentence and dexterously protracted the war y slow and ineffectual succours Their strength was formidable since the Lom bards

by an ambassador who received only verbal instructions from the mouth of his illiterate prince l The Bulgarians of whatsoever species were equally attracted by Roman wealth they assumed a vague dominion over the Scla vonian name and their rapid marches could only be stopped by the Baltic sea or the extreme cold and poverty of the north But the same race of Sclavonians appears to have maintained in every age the possession of the same countries Their numerous tribes however distant or adverse used one common language it was harsh and irregular and were known by the resemblance of their form which deviated from the swarthy Tartar and approached without attaining the lofty stature and fair complexion of the German Four thousand six hundred villages 2 were scattered over the provinces of Russia and Poland and their huts were hastily built of rough timber in a country deficient both in stone and iron Erected or rather concealed in the depth of forests on the banks of rivers or the edge of morasses we may not perhaps without flattery compare them to the architecture of the beaver which they resembled in a double issue to the land and water for the escape of the savage inhabitants an animal less cleanly less diligent and less social than that marvellous quadruped The fertility of the soil rather than the labour of the natives supplied the rustic plenty of the Scla vonians Their sheep and horned cattle were large and numerous and the fields which they sowed with millet and panic 3 afforded in the place of bread a coarse and less nutritive food The incessant rapine of their neighbours compelled them to bury this treasure in the earth but on the appearance of a stranger it was freely imparted by a people whose unfavourable character is qualified by the epi thets of chaste patient and hospitable As their supreme god they adored an in visible master of the thunder The rivers and the nymphs obtained their subordi nate honours and the popular worship was expressed in vows and sacrifice The Sclavonians disdained to obey a despot aprince or even a magistrate but their ex perience was too narrow their passions too headstrong to compose a system of equal law or general defence Some voluntary respect was yielded to age and valour but each tribe or village existed as a separate republic and all must be persuaded where none could be compelled They fought on foot almost naked and except an unwieldy shield without any defensive armouri their weapons of offence were a bow a quiver of small poisoned arrows and a long rope which they dexterously threw from a distance and entangled their enemy in a running noose In the field the Sclavonian infantry was dangerous by their speed agility and hardiness they swam they dived they remained under water drawing their hÂ Â th through a hollow cane and a river or lake was often the scene of thei ansusPected am buscade But these were the achievements of spies or s aSB ers the military art was unknown to the

was marked by an inva sion of the Huns or Bulgarians so dreadful that it almost effaced the memory of their past inroads They spread from the suburbs of Constantinople to the Ionian Gulph destroyed thirty two cities or castles erased Potidsea which Athens had built and Philip had besieged and repassed the Danube dragging at their horses heels one hundred and twenty thousand of the subjects of Justinian In a subsequent inroad they pierced the wall of the Thracian Chersonesus extirpated the habitations and the inhabitants boldly traversed the Hellespont and returned to their companions laden with the spoils of Asia Another party which seemed a multitude in the eyes of the Romans penetrated without opposition from the straits of Thermopyls to the isthmus of Corinth and the last ruin of Greece has appeared an object too minute for the attention of history The works which the emperor raised for the protection but at the expense of his subjects served only to disclose the weakness of some neglected part and the walls which by flat tery had been deemed impregnable were either deserted by the garrisons or scaled by the barbarians Three thousand Sclavonians who insolently divided tkemselves into two bands discovered the weakness and misery of a triumphant reign They passed the Danube and the Hebrus vanquished the Roman gene rals who dared to oppose their progress and plundered with impunity the cities of Illyricum and Thrace each of which had arms and numbers to overwhelm their contemptible assailants Whatever praise the boldness of the Sclavonians may deserve it is sullied by the wanton and deliberate cruelty which they are accused of exercising on their prisoners Without distinction of rank or age or sex the captiyte were impaled or flayed alive or suspended between four posts and beat en with clu till they expired or enclosed in some spacious buildings and left to perish in the ft es wfth the spoil and cattle which might impede the march of these savage victors

whose ob stinate defence had enraged the Slavonians they massacred fifteen thousand males but they spared the women and chilaien the most valuable captives were always reserved for labour or ransom the servitude was not rigorous and the terms of their deliverance were speedy and moderaie But the subject or the historian of Justinian exhaled his just indignation in the language of complaint and reproach and Procopius has confidently affirmed that in a reign of thirty two years each annual inroad of the barbarians consumed two hundred thousand of the inhabi tants of the Roman empire The entire population of Turkish Europe which nearly corresponds with the provinces o5 Justinian would perhaps be incapable of supplying six millions of persons the res u of this incredible estimate 5 In

turned towards the east and a golden wolf on the top of a spear seemed to guard the entrance of his tent One of the successors of Bertezena was tempted by the luxury and superstition of China but his

balahce their power and elude their armies it is because we wander without any fixed habitations in the exercise of war and hunting Are we strong we advance and conquer are we feeble we retire and are

gnomon of eight feet fixes the royal camp in the latitude of forty nine degrees and marks their extreme progress with in three or at least ten degrees of the polar circle 1 Among their southern con quests the most splendid was that of the Nepthalites or White Huns a polite and warlike people who possessed the commercial cities of Bochara and Samarcand who had vanquished the Persian monarch and carried their victorious arms along the banks and perhaps to the mouths of the Indus On the side of the west the Turkish cavalry advanced to the Lake Mxotis They passed that lake on the ice The khan who dwelt at the foot of mount Altai issued his com mands for the siege of Bosphorus 2 a city the voluntary subjects of Rome and whose princes had formerly been the friends of Athens 3 To the east the Turks invaded China as often as the vigour of the government was relaxed and I am taught to read in the history of the times that they mowed down their patient enemies like hemp or grass and that the mandarins applauded the wisdom of an emperor who repulsed these barbarians with golden lances This extent of savage empire compelled the Turkish monarch to establish three sub ordinate princes of his own blood who soon forgot their gratitude and allegiance The conquerors were enervated by luxury which is always fatal except to an industrious people the policy of China solicited the vanquished nations to resume their independence and the power of the Turks was limited to a period of two hundred years The revival of their name and dominion in the southern countries of Asia are the events of a later age and the dynasties which succeeded to their native realms may sleep in oblivion since their history bears no relation to the decline and fall of the Roman empire 4 In the rapid career of conquest the Turks attacked and subdued the nation of the Ogors or Varchonites on the banks of the river Til which derived the epithet of black from its dark water or gloomy forests 5 The khan of the Ogors was slain with three hundred thousand of his subjects and their bodies were scattered over the space of four days journey their surviving countrymen acknowledged the strength and mercy of the Turks and a small portion about twenty thousand warriors preferred exile to servitude They followed the well known road of the Volga cherished the error of the nations who confounded them with the

thirty he had lived above seventy five years his mind as well as his body was feeble and languid and the conqueror of Africa and Italy careless of the permanent interests ot his people aspired only to end his days in the bosom even of inglorious peace In a studied oration he imparted to the senate his reso lution to dissemble the insult and to purchase the friendship of the Avars and the whole senate like the mandarins of China applauded the incomparable wis dom and foresight of their sovereign The instruments of luxury were immedi ately prepared to captivate the barbarians silken garments soft and splendid beds and chains and collars incrusted with gold The ambassadors content with such a liberal reception departed from Constantinople and Valentin one of the empe ror s guards was sent with a similar character to their camp at the foot of mount Caucasus As their destruction or their success must be alike advantageous to the empire he persuaded them to invade the enemies of Rome and they were easily tempted by gifts and promises to gratify their ruling inclinations These fugi tives who fled before the Turkish arms passed the Tanais and Borysthenes and boldly advanced into the heart of Poland and Germany violating the law of na tions and abusing the rights of victory Before ten years had elapsed their camps were seated on the Danube and the Elbe many Bulgarian and Sclavonian names were obliterated from the earth and the remainder of their tribes are found as tri butaries and vassals under the standard of the Avars The chagan the peculiar title of their king still affected to cultivate the friendship of the emperor and Jus tinian â entertained some thoughts of fixing them in Pannonia to balance the pre vailing power of the Lombards But the virtue or treachery of an Avar betrayed the secret enmity and ambitious designs of their countrymen and they loudly com plained of the timid though jealous policy of detaining their ambassadors and denying the arms which they had been allowed to purchase in the capital of the empire l Perhaps the apparent change in the dispositions of the emperors may be ascri bed to the embassy which was received from the conquerors of the Avars 2 The immense distance which eluded their arms could not extinguish their resentment the Turkish ambassadors pursued the footsteps of the vanquished to the Jaik the Volga mount Caucasus the Euxine and Constantinople and at length appeared before the successor of Constantine to request that he would not espouse the cause of rebels and fugitives Even commerce had some share in this remarkable negotiation and the Sogdoites who were now the tributaries of the Turks em braced the fair occasion of opening by the north of the Caspian a new road for the importation of Chinese

Persia with a suspicion of poison and the great khan permitted his faithful vas sal Maniach the prince of the Sogdoites to propose at the Byzantine court a treaty of alliance against their common enemies Their splendid apparel and rich presents the fruit of oriental luxury distinguished Maniach and his colleagues from the rude savages of the north their letters in the Scythian character and language announced a people who had attained the rudiments of science 3 they enumerated the conquests they offered the friendship and military aid of the Turks and their sincerity was attested by direful imprecations if they were guil tv of falsehood against their own head and the head of Disabul their master The Greek prince entertained with hospitable regard the ambassadors of a remote and

ratification of the treaty was carried by a Roman minister to the foot of mount Altai Under the successors of Justinian the friendship of the two nations was cultivated by frequent and cor dial intercourse the most favoured vassals were permitted to imitate the example of the great khan and one hundred and six Turks who on various occasions had visited Constantinople departed at the same time for their native country The duration and length of the journey from the Byzantine court to mount Altai are not specified it might have been difficult to mark a road through the nameless de serts the mountains rivers and morasses of Tartary but a curious account has been preserved of the reception of the Roman ambassadors at the royal camp After they had been purified with fire and incense according to a rite still prac tised under the sons of Zingis they were introduced to the presence of Disabul In a valley of the Golden Mountain they found the great khan in his tent seated in a chair with wheels to which a horse might be occasionally harnessed As soon as they had delivered their presents which were received by their proper officers they exposed in a florid oration the wishes of the Roman emperor that victory might attend the arms of the Turks that their reign might be long and prosperous and that a strict alliance without envy or deceit might for ever be maintained be tween the two most powerful nations of the earth The answer of Disabul cor responded with these friendly professions and the ambassadors were seated by his side at a banquet which lasted the greatest part of the day the tent was sur rounded with silk hangings and a Tartar liquor was served on the table which possessed at least the intoxicating qualities of wine The entertainment of the succeeding day was more sumptuous the silk hangings of the second tent were embroidered in various figures and the royal seat the cups and the vases were of gold A third pavilion was supported by columns of gilt wood a bed of pure and massy gold was raised on four peacocks of the same metal and before the en trance of the tent dishes basins and statues of solid silver and admirable art were ostentatiously piled in wagons the monuments of valour rather than of in dustry When Disabul led his armies against the frontiers of Persia his Roman allies followed many days the march of the Turkish camp nor were they dis missed till they had enjoyed their precedency over the envoy of the great king whose loud and intemperate clamours interrupted the silence of the royal banquet The power and ambition of Chosroes cemented the union of the Turks and Ro mans who touched his dominions on either side but those distant nations regard less of each other consulted the dictates of interest without recollecting the ob ligations of oaths and treaties While the successor of Disabul celebrated his fa ther s obsequies he was saluted by the ambassadors of the emperor Tiberius who proposed an invasion of Persia and sustained with firmness the angry and per haps the just reproaches of that haughty barbarian You see my ten fingers said the great khan and he applied them to his mouth You Romans speak with as many tongues but they are tongues of deceit and perjury To me you hold one language to my subjects another and the nations are successively de luded by your perfidious eloquence You precipitate your allies into war and dan ger you enjoy their labours and you neglect your benefactors Hasten your re turn inform your master that a Turk is incapable of uttering or forgiving false hood and that he shall speedily meet the punishment which he deserves While he solicits my friendship with flattering and hollow words he is sunk to a confe derate of my fugitive Varchonites If I condescend to march against those contemptible slaves they will tremble at the sound of our whips they will be trampled like a nest of ants under the feet of my innumerable cavalry I am not ignorant of the road which they have followed to invade your empire nor can I he deceived by the vain pretence that mount Caucasus is the impregnable barrier of the Romans I know the course of the Niester the Danube and the Hebrus the most warlike nations have yielded to the arms of the Turks and from the rising to the setting sun the earth is my inheritance Notwithstanding this me nace a sense of mutual advantage soon renewed the alliance of the Turks and Ro mans but the pride of the great khan survived his resentment and when he an nounced an important conquest to his friend the emperor Maurice he styled him self the master of the seven races and the lord of the seven climates of the world 1 CD All the details of these Turkish anil Roman embassies so curious in the history of human manners are OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 79 Disputes have often arisen between the sovereigns of Asia for the title of king of the world while the contest has proved that it could not belong to either of the competitors The kingdom of the Turks was bounded by the Oxus or Gihon and Touran was separated by that great river from the rival monarch of Iran or Persia which in a smaller compass contained perhaps a larger measure of power and population The Persians who alternately invaded and repulsed the Turks and Romans were ruled by the house of Sassan which ascended the throne three hundred years before the accession of Justinian His cotemporary Cabades or Kobad had been successful in war against the emperor Anastasius but the reign of that prince was distracted by civil and religious troubles A prisoner in the hands of his subjects an exile among the enemies of Persia he recovered his li berty by prostituting the honour of his wife and regained his kingdom with the dangerous and mercenary aid of the barbarians who had slain his father His nobles were suspicious that Kobad never forgave the authors of his expulsion or even those of his restoration The people were deluded and inflamed by the fa naticism of Mazdak l who asserted the community of women 2 and the equa lity of mankind whilst he appropriated the richest lands and most beautiful fe males to the use of his sectaries The view of these disorders which had been fomented by his laws and example 3 imbittered the declining age of the Persian monarch and his fears were increased by the consciousness of his design to reverse the natural and customary order of succession in favour of his third and most fa voured son so famous under the names of Chosroes and Nushirvan To render the youth more illustrious in the eyes of the nations Kobad was desirous that he should be adopted by the emperor Justin the hope of peace inclined the Byzan tine court to accept this singular proposal and Chosroes might have acquired a specious claim to the inheritance of his Roman parent But the future mischief was diverted by the advice of the questor Proclus a difficulty was started whe ther the adoption should be performed as a civil or military rite 4 the treaty was abruptly dissolved and the sense of this indignity sunk deep into the mind of Chos roes who had already advanced to the Tigris on his road to Constantinople His father did not long survive the disappointment of his wishes the testament of their deceased sovereign was read in the assembly of the nobles and a powerful faction prepared for the event and regardless of the priority of age exalted Chosroes to the throne of Persia He filled that throne during a prosperous pe riod of forty eight years 5 and the Justice of Nushirvan is celebrated as the theme of immortal praise by the nations of the east But the justice of kings is understood by themselves and even by their subjects with an ample indulgence for the gratification of passion and interest The vir tue of Chosroes was that of a conqueror who in the measures of peace and war is excited by ambition and restrained by prudence who confounds the greatness with the happiness of a nation and calmly devotes the lives of thousands to the fame or even the amusement of a single man In his domestic administration the just Nushirvan would merit in our feelings the appellation of a tyrant His two elder

general and this act of humanity which was revealed by his son overbalanced the merit of reducing twelve nations to the obedience of Persia The zeal and prudence of Mebodes had fixed the diadem on the head of Chosroes himself but he delayed to attend the royal summons till he had performed the duties of a military review he was instantly commanded to repair to the iron tripod which stood before the gate of thepalace l where it was death to relieve or approach the victim and Mebodes languished several days before his sentence was pronounced by the inflexible pride and calm ingratitude of the son of Kobad But the people more especially in the east are disposed to forgive and even to applaud the cruelty which strikes at the loftiest heads at the slaves of ambition whose voluntary choice has ex posed them to live in the smiles and to perish by the frown of a capricious mo narch In the execution of the laws which he had no temptation to violate in the punishment of crimes which attacked his own dignity as well as the hap piness of individuals Nushirvan or Chosroes deserved the appellation of just His government was firm rigorous and impartial It was the first labour of his reign to abolish the dangerous theory of common or equal possessions the lands and women which the sectaries of Mazdak had usurped were restored to their lawful owners and the temperate chastisement of the fanatics or impostors con firmed the domestic rights of society Instead of listening with blind confidence to a favourite minister he established four viziers over the four great provinces of his empire Assyria Media Persia and Bactriana In the choice of judges prefects and counsellors he strove to remove the mask which is always worn in the presence of kings he wished to substitute the natural order ef talents for the accidental distinctions of birth and fortune he professed in specious lan guage his intention to prefer those men who carried the poor in their bosoms and to banish corruption from the seat of justice as dogs were excluded from the temples of the Magi The code of laws of the first Artaxerxes was revived and published as the rule of the magistrates but the assurance of speedy punishment was the best security of their virtue Their behaviour was inspected by a thousand eyes their words were overheard by a thousand ears the secret or public agents of the throne and the provinces from the Indian to the Arabian confines were enlightened by the frequent visits of a sovereign who affected to emulate his celestial brother in his rapid and salutary career Education and agri culture he viewed as the two objects most deserving of his care In every city of Persia orphans and the children of the poor were maintained and instructed at the public expense the daughters were given in marriage to the richest citizens of their own rank and the sons according to their different talents were em ployed in mechanic trades or promoted to more honourable service The desert ed villages were relieved by his bounty to the peasants and farmers who were found incapable of cultivating their lands he distributed cattle seed and the in struments of husbandry and the rare and inestimable treasure of fresh water was parsimoniously managed and skilfully dispersed over the arid territory of Per sia 2 The prosperity of that kingdom was the effect and the evidence of his virtues his vices are those of oriental despotism but in the long competition be tween Chosroes and Justinian the advantage both of merit and fortune is almost always on he side of the barbarian 3 To the praise of justice Nushirvan united the reputation of knowledge and the seven Greek philosophers who visited this court were invited and deceived by the strange assurance that a disciple of Plato was seated on the Persian throne Did they expect that a prince strenuously exercised in the toils of war and go vernment should agitate with dexterity like their own the abstruse and profound

he allowed himself freely to compare the tenets of the various sects and the theological disputes in which he frequent ly presided diminished the authority of the priest and enlightened the minds of

might be equally dark or equally intelligible in every tongue the dramatic art and verbal argumentation of the disciple of Socrates 9 appear to be indissolubly mingled with the grace and perfection of

Pilpay is far inferior to the concise elegance of Phiedrus and the native graces of La Fontaine Fifteen moral and political sentences are illustrated in a series of apologues but the composition is intricate the narrative prolix and the precept obvious and barren Yet the Brachman may assume the merit of inventing a pleasing fiction which adorns the nakedness of truth and alleviates perhaps to a royal ear the harshness of instruction With a similar design to admonish kings that they are strong only in the strength of their subjects the same Indians invented the game of chess which was likewise introduced into Persia under the reign of Nushirvan fi The son of Kobad found his kingdom involved in a war with the successor of Constantine and the anxiety of his domestic situation inclined him to grant the suspension of arms which Justinian was impatient to purchase Chosroes saw the Roman ambassadors at his feet He accepted eleven thousand pounds of gold as the price of an endless or indefinite peace 2 some mutual exchanges were regu lated the Persian assumed the guard of the gates of Caucasus and the demolition of Dara was suspended on condition that it should never be made the residence of the general of the east This interval of repose had been solicited and was dili gently improved by the ambition of the emperor his African conquests were the first fruits of the Persian treaty and the avarice of Chosroes was soothed by a large portion of the spoils of Carthage which his ambassadors required in a tone of plea santry and under the colour of friendship 3 But the trophies of Belisarius dis turbed the slumbers of the great king and he heard with astonishment envy and fear that Sicily Italy and Rome itself had been reduced in three rapid campaigns to the obedience of Justinian Unpractised in the art of violating treaties he se cretly excited his bold and subtle vassal Almondar That prince of the Saracens who resided atHira 4 hadnot been included in the general peace and still waged an obscure war against his rival Arethas the chief of the tribe of Gassan and con federate of the empire The subject of their dispute was an extensive sheep walk in the desert to the south of Palmyra An immemorial tribute for the license of pasture appeared to attest the rights of Almondar while the Gassanite appealed to the Latin name of strata a paved road as an unquestionable evidence of the so vereignty and labours of the Romans 5 The two monarchs supported the cause of their respective vassals and the Persian Arab without expecting the event of a slow and doubtful arbitration enriched his flying camp with the spoil and cap tives of Syria Instead of repelling the arms Justinian attempted to seduce the fidelity of Almondar while he called from the extremities of the earth the nations of Ethiopia and Scythia to invade the dominions of his rival But the aid of such allies was distant and precarious and the discovery of this hostile correspondence justified the complaints of the Goths and Armenians who implored almost at the same time the protection of Chosroes The descendants of Arsaces who were still numerous in Armenia had been provoked to assert the last relics of national freedom and hereditary rank and the ambassadors of Vitiges had secretly tra versed the empire to expose the instant and almost inevitable danger of the king dom of Italy Their representations were uniform weighty and effectual  We stand before your throne the advocates of your interest as well as of our own The ambitious and faithless Justinian aspires to be the

without defence while the armies of Justinian and his renowned general are detained in the distant regions of the west If you hesitate and delay Belisarius and his victorious troops will soon return from the Tiber to the Tigris and Persia may enjoy the wretched consolation of being the last devoured 1 By such arguments Chosroes was easily persuaded to imi tate the example which he condemned but the Persian ambitious of military fame disdained the inactive warfare of a rival who issued his sanguinary com mands from the secure station of the Byzantine palace Whatever might be the provocation of Chosroes he abused the confidence of treaties and the just reproaches of dissimulation and falsehood could only be con cealed by the lustre of his victories 2 The Persian army which had been as sembled in the plains of Babylon prudently declined the strong cities of Mesopo tamia and followed the western bank of the Euphrates till the small though popu lous town of Dura presumed to arrest the progress of the great king 1 he gates of Dura by treachery and surprise were burst open and as soon as Chosroes had stained his simitar with the blood of the inhabitants he dismissed the ambassador of Justinian to inform his master in what place he had left the enemy of the Ro mans The conqueror still affected the praise of humanity and justice p nd as he heheld a noble matron with her infant rudely dragged along the ground he sighed he wept and implored the divine justice to punish the author of these calamities Yet the herd of twelve thousand captives was ransomed for two hundred pounds of gold the neighbouring bishop of Sergiopolis pledged his faith for the payment and in the subsequent year the unfeeling avarice of Chosroes exacted the penalty of an obligation which it was generous to contract and impossible to discharge He advanced into the heart of Syria but a feeble enemy who vanished at his ap proach disappointed him of the honour of victory and as he could not hope to es tablish his dominion the Persian king displayed in this inroad the mean and rapa cious vices of a robber Hierapolis Berrhac or Aleppo Apamea and Chalcis were successively besieged they redeemed their safety by a ransom of gold or sil ver proportioned to their respective strength and opulence and their new master enforced without observing their terms of capitulation Educated in the religion of the Magi he exercised without remorse the lucrative trade of sacrilege and after stripping of its gold and gems a piece of the true cross he generously restored the naked relic to the devotion of the Christians of Apamea No more than four teen years had elapsed since Antioch was ruined by an earthquake but the queen of the east the new Theopolis had been raised from the ground by the liberality of Justinian and the increasing greatness of the buildings and the people already erased the memory of this recent disaster On one side the city was defended by the mountain on the other by the river Orontes but the most accessible part was commanded by a superior eminences the proper remedies were rejected from the despicable fear of discovering its weakness to the enemy and Germanus the em peror s nephew refused to trust his person and dignity within the walls of a be sieged city The people of Antioch had inherited the vain and satirical genius of their ancestors they were elated by a sudden re enforcement of six thousand sol diers they disdained the offers of an easy capitulation and their intemperate cla mours insulted from the ramparts the majesty of the great king Under his eye the Persian myriads mounted with scaling ladders to the assault the Roman mer cenaries fled through the opposite gate of Daphne and the generous assistance of the youth of Antioch served only to aggravate the miseries of their country As Chosroes attended by the ambassadors of Justinian was descending from the moun tain he affected in a plaintive voice to deplore the obstinacy and ruin of that un happy people but the slaughter still raged with unrelenting fury and the city at the command of a barbarian was delivered to the flames The cathedral of An tioch was indeed preserved by the avarice not the pity of the conqueror a more honourable exemption was granted to the church of St Julian and the quarter of the town where the ambassadors resided some distant streets were saved by the shifting of the wind and the walls still subsisted to protect and soon to betray their new inhabitants Fanaticism had defaced the ornaments of Daphne but 1 1 have blended in a short speech the two oraiions of the

Chosroes breathed a purer air amidst her groves and fountains and some idolater in his train might sacrifice with impunity to the nymphs of that elegant retreat Eighteen miles below Antioch the river Orontes falls into the Mediterranean The haughty Persian visited the term of his conquests and after bathing alone in the sea he offered a solemn sacrifice of thanksgiving to the sun or rather to the Creator of the sun whom the Magi adored If this act of superstition offended the prejudices of the Syrians they were pleased by the courteous and even eager attention with which he assisted at the games of the circus and as Chosroes had heard that the blue faction was espoused by the emperor his peremptory com mand secured the victory of the green charioteer From the discipline of his camp the people derived more solid consolation and they interceded in vain for the life of a soldier who had too faithfully copied the rapine of the just Nushirvan At length fatigued though unsatiated with the spoil ol Syria he slowly moved to the Euphrates formed a temporary bridge in the neighbourhood of Barbalissus and defined the space of three days for the entire passage of his numerous host After his return he founded at the distance of one day s journey from the palace of Ctesiphon a new city which perpetuated the joint names of Chosroes and of An tioch The Syrian captives recognised the form and situation of their native abodes baths and a stately circus were constructed for their use and a colony of musicians and charioteers revived in Assyria the pleasures of a Greek capital By the mu nificence of the royal founder a liberal allowance was assigned to these fortunate exiles and they enjoyed the singular privilege of bestowing freedom on the slaves whom they acknowledged as their kinsmen Palestine and the holy wealth of Jerusalem were the next objects that attracted the ambition or rather the avarice of Chosroes Constantinople and the palace of the Caesars no longer appeared impregnable or remote and his aspiring fancy already covered Asia Minor with his troops and the Black Sea with the navies of Persia These hopes might have been realized if the conqueror of Italy had not beep seasonably recalled to the defence of the east fl While Chosroes pursued his ambitious designs on the coast of the Euxine Belisarius at the head of an army without pay or discipline encamped beyond the Euphrates within six miles of Nisibis He meditated by a skilful operation to draw the Persians from their impregnable citadel and improving his advantage in the field either to intercept their retreat or perhaps to enter the gates with the flying barbarians He ad vanced one day s journey on the territories of Persia reduced the fortress of Si saurane and sent the governor with eight hundred chosen horsemen to serve the emperor in his Italian wars He detached Arethas and his Arabs supported by twelve hundred Romans to pass the Tigris and to ravage the harvests of Assyria a fruitful province long exempt from the calamities of war But the plans of Be lisarius were disconcerted by the untractable spirit of Arethas who neither re turned to the camp nor sent any intelligence of his motions The Roman geneÂ ral was fixed in anxious expectation to the same spot the time of action elapsed the ardent sun of Mesopotamia inflamed with fevers the blood of his European sol diers and the stationary troops and officers of Syria affected to tremble for the safety of their defenceless cities Yet this diversion had already succeeded in forcing Chosroes to return with loss and precipitation and if the skill of Belisarius had been seconded by discipline and valour his success might have satisfied the sanguine wishes of the public who required at his hands the conquests of Ctesi phon and the deliverance of the captives of Antioch At the end of the campaign he was recalled to Constantinople by an ungrateful court but the dangers of the ensuing spring restored his confidence and command and the hero almost alone was despatched with the speed of post horses to repel by his name and presence the invasion of Syria He found the Roman generals among whom was a ne phew of Justinian imprisoned by their fears in the fortification of Hierapolis But instead of listening to their timid counsels Belisarius commanded them to fol low him to Europus where he had resolved to collect his forces and to execute whatever God should inspire him to achieve against the enemy His firm atti tude on the banks of the Euphrates restrained Chosroes from advancing towards Palestine and he received with art and dignity the ambassadors or rather spies of the Persian monarch The plain between Hierapolis and the river was covered with the squadrons of cavalry six thousand hunters tall and robust who pursued 1 In the public hiitory of Procopius Persic lib ii c 18 18â 21 24â 28 and with tome slight exceptions we may reasonably shut our ears against the malevolent whisper

horse who appeared to guard the pas Sage of the Euphrates The tent of Belisarius was of the coarsest linen the sim ple equipage of a warrior who disdained the luxury of the east Around his tent the nations who marched under his standard were arranged with skilful confusion The Thracians and Illyrians were posted in the front the Heruli and Goths in the centre the prospect was closed by the Moors and Vandals and their loose array seemed to multiply their numbers Their dress was light and active one soldier carried a whip another a sword a third a bow a fourth perhaps a battle axe and the whole picture exhibited the intrepidity of the troops and the vigi lance of the general Chosroes was deluded by the address and awed by the genius of the lieutenant of Justinian Conscious of the merit and ignorant of the force of his antagonist he dreaded a decisive battle in a distant country from whence not a Persian might return to relate the melancholy tale The great king hastened to repass the Euphrates and Belisarius pressed his retreat by affecting to oppose a measure so salutary to the empire and which could scarcely have been prevented by an army of a hundred thousand men Envy might suggest to igno rance and pride that the public enemy had been suffered to escape but the Afri can and Gothic triumphs are less glorious than this safe and bloodless victory in which neither fortune nor the valour of the soldiers can subtract any part of the general s renown The second removal of Belisarius from the Persian to the Ita lian war revealed the extent of his personal merit which had corrected or sup plied the want of discipline and courage Fifteen generals without concert or skill led through the mountains of Armenia an army of thirty thousand Romans inattentive to their signals their ranks and their ensigns Four thousand Persians intrenched the camp of Dubis vanquished almost without a combat this disor derly multitude their useless arms were scattered along the road and their horses sunk under the fatigue of their rapid flight But the Arabs of the Roman party prevailed over their brethren the Armenians returned to their allegiance the cities of Dara and Edessa resisted a sudden assault and a regular siege and the calamities of war were suspended by those of pestilence A tacit or formal agree ment between the two sovereigns protected the tranquillity of the eastern frontier and the arms of Chosroes were confined to the Colchian or Lazic war which has been too minutely described by the historians of the times 1 The extreme length of the Euxine sea 2 from Constantinople to the mouth of the Phasis may be computed as a voyage of nine days and a measure of seven hundred miles From the Iberian Caucasus the most lofty and craggy mountains of Asia that river descends with such oblique vehemence that in a short space it is traversed by one hundred and twenty bridges Nor does the stream become placid and navigable till it reaches the town of Sarapana five days journey from the Cyrus which flows from the same hills but in a contrary direction to the Caspian lake The proximity of these rivers has suggested the practice or at least the idea of wafting the precious merchandise of India down the Oxus over the Caspian up the Cyrus and with the current of the Phasis into the Euxine and Mediterranean seas As it successively collects the streams of the plain of Colchos the Phasis moves with diminished speed though accumulated weight At the mouth it is sixty fathoms deep and half a league broad but a small woody island is interposed in the midst of the channel the water so soon as it has depo sited an earthy or metallic sediment floats on the surface of the waves and is no longer susceptible of corruption In a course of one hundred miles forty of which are navigable for large vessels the Phasis divides the celebrated region of Colchos 3 or Mingrelia 4 which on three sides is fortified by the Iberian and 1 The Lazic war the contest of Rome and

maritime coast extends about two hundred miles from the neighbourhood of Trebizond to Dioscurias and the confines of Circassia Both the soil and climate are relaxed by excessive moisture twenty eight rivers besides the Phasis and his dependent streams convey their waters to the sea and the hollowness of the ground appears to indicate the subterraneous channels be tween the Euxine and the Caspian In the fields where wheat or barley is sown the earth is too soft to sustain the action of the plough but the gom a small grain not unlike the millet or coriander seed supplies the ordinary food of the people and the use of bread is confined to the prince and his nobles Yet the vintage is more plentiful than the harvest and the bulk of the stems as well as the quality of the wine display the unassisted powers of nature The same powers continu ally tend to overshadow the face of the country with thick forests the timber of the hills and the flax of the plains contribute to the abundance of naval stores the wild and the tame animals the horse the ox and the hog are remarkably rolific and the name of the pheasant is expressive of his native habitation on the anks of the Phasis The gold mines to the south of Trebizond which are still worked with sufficient profit were a subject of national dispute between Justinian and Chosroes and it is not unreasonable to believe that a vein of precious metal may be equally diffused through the circle of the hills although these secret trea sures are neglected by the laziness or concealed by the prudence of the Mingre lians The waters impregnated with particles of gold are carefully strained through sheep skins or fleeces but this expedient the ground work perhaps of a marvellous fable affords a faint image of the wealth extracted from a virgin earth by the power and industry of ancient kings Their silver palaces and golden chambers surpass our belief but the fame of their riches is said to have excited the enterprising avarice of the Argonauts 1 Tradition has affirmed with some colour of reason that Egypt planted on the Phasis a learned and polite colony 2 which manufactured linen built navies and invented geographical maps The ingenuity of the moderns has peopled with flourishing cities and nations the isth mus between the Euxine and the Caspian 3 and a lively writer observing the resemblance of climate and in his apprehension of trade has not hesitated to pro nounce Colchos the Holland of antiquity 4 But the riches of Colchos shine only through the darkness of conjecture or tra dition and its genuine history presents a uniform scene of rudeness and poverty If one hundred and thirty languages were spoken in the market of Dioscurias 5 they were the imperfect idioms of so many savage tribes or families

southern nations of Asia The proper district of Mingrelia a portion only of the ancient Colchos has long sustained an exportation of twelve thousand slaves The num ber of prisoners and criminals would be inadequate to the annual demand but the common people are in a state of servitude to their lords the exercise of fraud or rapine is unpunished in a lawless community and the market is continually reple nished by the abuse of civil and paternal authority Such a trade 2 which re duces the human species to the level of cattle may tend to encourage marriage and population since the multitude of children enriches their sordid and inhuman parent But this source of impure wealth must inevitably poison the national man ners obliterate the sense of honour and virtue and almost extinguish the instincts of nature the Christians of Georgia and Mingrelia are the most dissolute of man kind and their children who in a tender age are sold into foreign slavery have already learnt to imitate the rapine of the father and the prostitution of the mo ther Yet amidst the rudest ignorance the untaught natives discover a singular dexterity both of mind and hand and although the want of union and discipline exposes them to their more powerful neighbours a bold and intrepid spirit has animated the Colcliians of every age In the host of Xerxes they served on foot and their arms were a dagger or a javelin a wooden casque and a buckler of raw hides But in their own country the use of cavalry has more generally prevailed the meanest of the peasants disdain to walk the martial nobles are possessed perhaps of two hundred horses and above five thousand are numbered in the train of the prince of Mingrelia The Colchian government has been always a pure and hereditary kingdom and the authority of the sovereign is only restrained by the turbulence of his subjects Whenever they were obedient he could lead a numerous army into the field but some faith is requisite to believe that the sin gle tribe of the Suanians was composed of two hundred thousand soldiers or that the population of Mingrelia now amounts to four millions of inhabitants 3 It was the boast of the Colchians that their ancestors had checked the victo ries of Sesostris and the defeat of the Egyptian is less incredible than his success ful progress as far as the foot of Mount Caucasus They sunk without any me morable effort under the arms of Cyrus followed in distant wars the standard of the great king and presented him every fifth year with one hundred boys and as many virgins the fairest produce of the land 4 Yet he accepted this gift like the gold and ebony of India the frankincense of the Arabs or the negroes and ivory of Ethiopia the Colchians were not subject to the dominion of a satrap and they continued to enjoy the name as well as substance of national independence 5 After the fall of the Persian empire Mithridates king of Pontus added Colchos to the wide circle of his dominions on the Euxine and when the natives presumed to request that his son might reign over them he bound the ambitious youth in chains of gold and delegated a servant in his place In the pursuit of Mithridates the Romans advanced to the banks of the Phasis and their galleys ascended the river till they reached the camp of Pompey and his legions 6 But the senate and af terwards the emperors disdained to reduce

was permitted to reign in Colchos and the adjacent kingdoms from the time of Mark Antony to that of Nero and after the race of Polemo l was extinct the eastern Pontus which preserved his name extended no farther than the neighbourhood of Trebizond Beyond these limits the fortifications of Hyssus of Apsarus of the Phasis of Di oscurias or Sebastopolis and of Pityus were guarded by sufficient detachments of horse and foot and six princes of Colchos received their diadems from the lieu tenants of Cicsar One of these lieutenants the eloquent and philosophic Arrian surveyed and has described the Euxine coast under the reign of Hadrian The garrison which he reviewed at the mouth of the Phasis consisted of four hundred chosen legionaries the brick walls and towers the double ditch and the military engines on the rampart rendered this place inaccessible to the barbarians but the new suburbs which had been built by the merchants and veterans required in the opinion of Arrian some external defence 2 As the strength of the empire was gradually impaired the Romans stationed on the Phasis were either with drawn or expelled and the tribe of the Lazi 3 whose posterity speak a foreign dialect and inhabit the sea coast of Trebizond imposed their name and dominion on the ancient kingdom of Colchos Their independence was soon invaded by a formidable neighbour who had acquired by arms and treaties the sovereignty of Iberia The dependant king of Lazica received his sceptre at the hands of the Persian monarch and the successors of Constantine acquiesced in this injurious claim which was proudly urged as a right of immemorial prescription In the beginning of the sixth century their influence was restored by the introduction of Christianity which the Mingrelians still profess with becoming zeal without un derstanding the doctrines or observing the precepts of their religion After the decease of his father Zathus was exalted to the regal dignity by the favour of the great king but the pious youth abhorred the ceremonies of the Magi and sought in the palace of Constantinople an orthodox baptism a noble wife and the al liance of the emperor Justinian 4 The king of Lazica was solemnly invested with the diadem and his cloak and tunic of white silk with a gold border dis played in rich embroidery the figure of his new patron who soothed the jealousy of the Persian com t and excused the revolt of Colchos by the venerable names of hospitality and religion The common interest of both empires imposed on the Colchians the duty of guarding the passes of Mount Caucasus where a wall of sixty miles is now defended by the monthly service of the musketeers of Miir greha But this honourable connexion was soon corrupted by the avarice and ambition of the Romans Degraded from the rank of allies the Lazi were incessantly re minded by words and actions of their dependant state At the distance of a day s journey beyond the Apsarus they beheld the rising fortress of Petra 5 which commanded the maritime country to the south of the Phasis Instead of being protected by the valour Colchos was insulted by the licentiousness of fo reign mercenaries the benefits of commerce were converted into base and vexatious monopoly and Gubazes their native prince was reduced to a pageant of royalty by the superior influence of the officers of Justinian Disappointed in their ex pectations of Christian virtue the indignant Lazi reposed some confidence in the justice of an unbeliever After a private assurance that their ambassador should not be delivered to the Romans they publicly solicited the friendship and aid of Chosroes The sagacious monarch instantly discerned the use and importance of Colchos and meditated a plan of conquest which was renewed at the end of

Agathias Most of the towns and castles ot Lazica may be found by comparing their names and position with the map of Mingrelia in Lamberti  OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 89 thousand years by Shah Abbas the wisest and most powerful of his successors 1 His ambition was fired by the hope of launching a Persian navy from the Phasis of commanding the trade and navigation of the Euxine sea of desolating the coast of Pontus and Bithynia of distressing perhaps of attacking Constantinople and of persuading the barbarians of Europe to second his arms and counsels against the common enemy of mankind Under the pretence of a Scythian war he si lently led his troops to the frontiers of Iberia the Colchian guides were prepared to conduct them through the woods and along the precipices of mount Caucasus and a narrow path was laboriously formed into a safe and spacious highway for the march of cavalry and even of elephants Gubazes laid his person and dia dem at the feet of the king of Persia his Colchians imitated the submission of their prince and after the walls of Petra had been shaken the Roman garrison prevented by a capitulation the impending fury of the last assault But the Lazi soon discovered that their impatience had urged them to choose an evil more in tolerable than the calamities which they strove to eacape The monopoly of salt and corn was effectually removed by the loss of those valuable commodities The authority of a Roman legislator was succeeded by the pride of an oriental despot who beheld with equal disdain the slaves whom he had exalted and the kings â whom he had humbled before the footstool of his throne The adoration of fire â was introduced into Colchos by the zeal of the Magi their intolerant spirit pro voked the fervour of a Christian people and the prejudice of nature or education was wounded by the impious practice of exposing the dead bodies of their parents on the summit of a lofty tower to the crows and vultures of the air 2 Con scious of the increasing hatred which retarded the execution of his designs the just Nushirvan had secretly given orders to assassinate the king of the Lazi to transplant the people into some distant land and to fix a faithful and warlike colo ny on the banks of the Phasis The watchful jealousy of the Colchians foresaw and averted the approaching ruin Their repentance was accepted at Constanti nople by the prudence rather than the clemency of Justinian and he commanded Dagisteus with seven thousand Romans and one thousand of the Zani to expel the Persians from the coast of the Euxine siege of Petra which the Roman general with the aid of the Lazi imme undertook is one of the most remarkable actions of the age The city was on a craggy rock which hung over the sea and communicated by a steep and narrow path with the land Since the approach was difficult the attack might be deemed impossible the Persian conqueror had strengthened the fortifications of Justinian and the places least inaccessible were covered by additional bulwarks In this important fortress the vigilance of Chosroes had deposited a magazine of offensive and defensive arms sufficient for five times the number not only of the garrison but of the besiegers themselves The stock of flour and salt provisions â was adequate to the consumption of five years the want of wine was supplied by vinegar and of grain from whence a strong liquor was extracted and a triple aqueduct eluded the diligence and even the suspicions of the enemy But the firmest defence of Petra was placed in the valour of fifteen hundred Persians who resisted the assaults of the Romans whilst in a softer vein of earth a mine was se cretly perforated The wall supported by slender and temporary props hung tottering in the air but Dagisteus delayed the attack till he had secured a specific recompense and the town was relieved before the return of his messenger from Constantinople The Persian garrison was reduced to four hundred men of whom no more than fifty were exempt from sickness or wounds yet such had been their inflexible perseverance that they concealed their losses from the enemy by en during without a murmur the sight and putrifying stench of the dead bodies of their eleven hundred companions After their deliverance the breaches were hastily stopped with sand bags the mine was replenished with earth a new wall was erected on a frame of substantial timber and a fresh garrison of three thou sand men was stationed at Petra to sustain the labours of a second siege The ope 1 See the amusing letters of

conducted with skilful obstinacy and each party derived useful lessons from the experience of their past faults A bat tering ram was invented of light construction and powerful effect it was trans ported and worked by the hands of forty soldiers and as the stones were loosened by its repeated strokes they were torn with long iron hooks from the wall From those walls a shower of darts was incessantly poured on the heads of the assailants but they were most dangerously annoyed by a fiery composition of sulphur and bi tumen which in Colehos might with some propriety be named the oil of Medea Of six thousand Romans who mounted the scaling ladders their general Bessas was the first a gallant veteran of seventy years of age the courage of their leader his fall and extreme danger animated the irresistible efforts of his troops and their prevailing numbers oppressed the strength without subduing the spirit of the Persian garrison The fate of these valiant men deserves to be more distinctly noticed Seven hundred had perished in the siege two thousand three hundred survived to defend the breach One thousand and seventy were destroyed with fire and sword in the last assault and if seven hundred and thirty were made pri soners only eighteen among them were found without the marks of honourable wounds The remaining five hundred escaped into the citadel which they main tained without any hopes of relief rejecting the fairest terms of capitulation and service till they were lost in the flames They died in obedience to the commands of their prince and such examples of loyalty and valour might excite their coun trymen to deeds of equal despair and more prosperous event The instant demo lition of the works of Petra confessed the astonishment and apprehension of the conqueror A Spartan would have praised and pitied the virtue of these heroic slaves but the tedious warfare and alternate success of the Roman and Persian arms cannot detain the attention of posterity at the foot of mount Caucasus The advantages obtained by the troops of Justinian were more frequent and splendid but the forces of the great king were continually supplied till they amounted to eight elephants and seventy thousand men including twelve thousand Scythian allies and above three thousand Dilemites who descended by their free choice from the hills of Hyrcania and were equally formidable in close or in distant combat The siege of Archseopolis a name imposed or corrupted by the Greeks wasraised with some loss and precipitation but the Persians occupied the passes of Iberiar Colehos was enslaved by their forts and garrisons they devoured the scanty sustenance of the people and the prince of the Lazi fled into the mountains In the Roman camp faith and discipline were unknown and the independent leaders who were invest ed with equal power disputed with each other the pre eminence of vice and cor ruption The Persians followed without a murmur the commands of a single chief who implicitly obeyed the instructions of their supreme lord Their general was distinguished among the heroes of the east by his wisdom in council and his valour in the field The advanced age of Mermeroes and the lameness of both his feet could not diminish the activity of his mind or even of his body and whilst he was carried in a litter in the front of battle he inspired terror to the enemy and a just confidence to the troops who under his banners were always successful Af ter his death the command devolved to Nacoragan a proud satrap who in con ference with the inferior chiefs had presumed to declare that he disposed of victo ry as absolutely as of the ring on his finger Such presumption was the natural cause and forerunner of a shameful defeat The Romans had been gradually re pulsed to the edge of the sea shore and their last camp on the ruins of the Gre cian colony of Phasis was defended on all sides by strong intrenchments the river the Euxine and a fleet of galleys Despair united their councils and invigorated their arms they withstood the assaults of the Persians and the flight of Nacoragan preceded or followed the slaughter of ten thousand of his bravest soldiers He es caped from the Romans to fall into the hands of an unforgiving master who severe ly chastised the error of his own choice the unfortunate general was flayed alive and his skin stuffed into the human form was exposed on a mountain a dreadful warn ing to those who might hereafter be intrusted with the fame and fortune of Per sia 1 Yet the prudence of Chosroes insensibly relinquished the prosecution of the Colchian war in the just persuasion that it is impossible to reduce or at least to hold a distant country against the wishes and efforts of its inhabitants The  l The punishment

specious temptations of the Persian court The king of the Lazi had been educated in the Christian reli gion his mother was the daughter of a senator during his youth he had served ten years a silentiary of the Byzantine palace l and the arrears of an unpaid salary were a motive of attachment as well as of complaint But the long continuance of his sufferings extorted from him a naked representation of the truth and truth was an unpardonable libel on the lieutenants of Justinian who amidst the delays of a ruinous war had spared his enemies and trampled on his allies Their ma licious information persuaded the emperor that his faithless vassal already medi tated a second defection an order was issued to send him prisoner to Constantino ple a treacherous clause was inserted that he might be lawfully killed in case of resistance and Gubazes without arms or suspicion of danger was stabbed in the security of a friendly interview In the first moments of rage and despair the Col chians would have sacrificed their country and religion to the gratification of re venge But the authority and eloquence of the wiser few obtained a salutary pause the victory of the Phasis restored the terror of the Roman arms and the emperor was solicitous to absolve his own name from the imputation of so foul a murder A judge of senatorial rank was commissioned to inquire into the conduct and death of the king of the Lazi He ascended a stately tribunal encompassed by the ministers of justice and punishment in the presence of both nations this extra ordinary cause was pleaded according to the forms of civil jurisprudence and some satisfaction was granted to an injured people by the sentence and execution of the meaner criminals 2 In peace the king of Persia continually sought the pretences of a rupture but no sooner had he taken up arms than he expressed his desire of a sate and ho nourable treaty During the fiercest hostilities the two monarchs entertained a deceitful negotiation and such was the superiority of Chosroes that whilst he treated the Roman ministers with insolence and contempt he obtained the most unprecedented honours for his own ambassadors at the imperial court The suc cessor of Cyrus assumed the majesty of the eastern sun and graciously permitted his younger brother Justinian to reign over the west with the pale and reflected splendour of the moon This gigantic style was supported by the pomp and elo quence of Isdigune One of the royal chamberlains His wife and daughters with a train of eunuchs and camels attended the march of the ambassador two satraps with golden diadems were numbered among his followers he was guarded by five hundred horse the most valiant of the Persians and the Roman governor of Dara wisely refused to admit more than twenty of this martial and hostile caravan When Isdigune had saluted the emperor and delivered his presents he passed ten months at Constantinople without discussing any serious affairs Instead of being confined to his palace and receiving food and water from the hands of his keepers the Per sian ambassador without spies or guards was allowed to visit the capital and the freedom of conversation and trade enjoyed by his domestics offended the preju dices of an age which rigorously practised the law of nations without confidence or courtesy 3 By an unexampled indulgence his interpreter a servant below the notice of a Roman magistrate was seated at the table of Justinian by the side of his master and one thousand pounds of gold might be assigned for the ex pense of his journey and entertainment Yet the repeated labours of Isdigune could procure only a partial and imperfect truce which was always purchased with the treasures and renewed at the solicitation of the Byzantine court Many years of fruitless desolation elapsed before Justinian and Chosroes were compelled by mutual lassitude to consult the repose of their declining age At a confe rence held on the frontier each party without expecting to gain credit displayed the power the justice and the pacific intentions of their respective sovereigns but necessity and interest dictated the treaty of peace

remained without alteration and Chosroes was persuaded to renounce his dangerous claim to the possession or sovereignty of Colchos and its dependant states Rich in the accumulated treasures of the east he extorted from the Romans an annual payment of thirty thousand pieces of gold and the smallness of the sum revealed the disgrace of a tribute in its naked deformity In a previous debate the

that Justinian was flattered by the hope of diverting the silk trade through the channel of Abyssinia and of exciting the forces of Arabia against the Persian king Nonnosus descended from a family of

Rebellions of Africa â Restoration of the Gothic kingdom by Totila â Loss and recovery of Some â Final conquest of Italy by Narses Extinction of the Ostrogoths â De feat of the Franks and Alemanni Last victory disgrace and death of Belisarius â Death and character of Justinian â Comet earthquakes and plague The review of the nations from the Danube to the Nile has exposed on every side the weakness of the Romans and our wonder is reasonably excited that they should presume to enlarge an empire whose ancient limits they were incapable of defending But the wars the conquests and the triumphs of Justinian are the feeble and pernicious efforts of old age which exhaust the remains of strength and accelerate the decay of the powers of life He exulted in the glorious act of restoring Africa and Italy to the republic but the calamities which followed the departure of Belisarius betrayed the impotence of the conqueror and accomplished the ruin of those unfortunate countries From his new acquisitions Justinian expected that his avarice as well as pride should be richly gratified A rapacious minister of the finances closely pursued the footsteps of Belisarius and as the old registers of tribute had been burnt by the Vandals he indulged his fancy in a liberal calculation and arbitrary assess ment of the wealth of Africa 1 The increase of taxes which were drawn away by a distant sovereign and a general resumption of the patrimony or crown lands soon dispelled the intoxication of the public joy but the emperor was insen sible to the modest complaints of the people till he was awakened and alarmed by the clamours of military discontent Many of the Roman soldiers had married the â widows and daughters of the Vandals As their own by the double right of con quest and inheritance they claimed the estates which Genseric had assigned to his victorious troops They heard with disdain the cold and selfish representa tions of their officers that the liberality of Justinian had raised them from a sa vage or servile condition that they were already enriched by the spoils of Africa the treasure the slaves and the moveables of the vanquished barbarians and that the ancient and lawful patrimony of the emperors would be applied only to the support of that government on which their own safety and reward must ulti mately depend The mutiny was secretly inflamed by a thousand soldiers for the most part Heruli who had imbibed the doctrines and were instigated by the clergy of the Arian sect and the cause of perjury and rebellion was sanctified by the dispensing powers of fanaticism The Arians deplored the ruin of their church triumphant above a century in Africa and they were justly provoked by the laws of the conqueror which interdicted the baptism of their children and the exer cise of all religious worship Of the Vandals chosen by Belisarius the far greater part in the honours of the eastern service forgot their country and religion But a generous band of four hundred obliged the mariners when they were in sight of the isle of Lesbos to alter their course they touched on Peloponnesus ran ashore on a desert coast of Africa and boldly erected on mount Aurasius the standard of independence and revolt While the troops of the province disclaimed the com mand of their superiors a conspiracy was formed at Carthage against the life of Solomon who filled with honour the place of Belisarius and the Arians had pi ously resolved to sacrifice the tyrant at the foot of the altar during the awful mys teries of the festival of Easter Fear or remorse restrained the daggers of the as sassins but the patience of Solomon emboldened their discontent and at the end of ten days a furious sedition was kindled in the circus which desolated Africa above ten years The pillage of the city and the indiscriminate slaughter of its inhabitants were suspended only by darkness sleep and intoxication the go vernor with seven companions among whom was the historian Procopius escaped to Sicily two thirds of the army were involved in the guilt of treason and eight 1 For the troubles of Africa I neither have nor desire another guide

their chief a private soldier who possessed in a superior degree the virtues of a rebel Un der the mask of freedom his eloquence could lead or at least impel the passions of his equals He raised himself to a level with Belisarius and the nephew of the emperor by daring to encounter them in the field and the victorious generals were compelled to acknowledge that Stoza deserved a purer cause and a more legitimate command Vanquished in battle he dexterously employed the arts of negotiation s a Roman army was seduced from their allegiance and the chiefs â who had trusted to his faithless promise were murdered by his order in a church of Numidia When every resource either of force or perfidy was exhausted Stoza with some desperate Vandals retired to the wilds of Mauritania obtained the daughter of a barbarian prince and eluded the pursuit of his enemies by the report of his death The personal weight of Belisarius the rank the spirit and the temper of Germanus the emperor s nephew and the vigour and success of the second administration of the eunuch Solomon restored the modesty of the camp and maintained for awhile the tranquillity of Africa But the vices of the By zantine court were felt in that distant province the troops complained that they â were neither paid nor relieved and as soon as the public disorders were sufficiently mature Stoza was again alive in arms and at the gates of Carthage He fell in a single combat but he smiled in the agonies of death when he was informed that his own javelin had reached the heart of his antagonist The example of Stoza and the assurance that a fortunate soldier had been the first king encouraged the ambition of Gontharis and he promised by a private treaty to divide Africa with the Moors if with their dangerous aid he should ascend the throne of Carthage The feeble Areobindus unskilled in the affairs of peace and war was raised by his marriage with the niece of Justinian to the office of exarch He was suddenly oppressed by a sedition of the guards and his abject supplications which pro voked the contempt could not move the pity of the inexorable tyrant After a reign of thirty days Gontharis himself was stabbed at a banquet by the hand or Artaban and it is singular enough that an Armenian prince of the royal family of Arsaces should re establish at Carthage the authority of the Roman empire In the conspiracy which unsheathed the dagger of Brutus against the life of C esar every circumstance is curious and important to the eyes of posterity but the guilt or merit of these loyal or rebellious assassins could interest only the cotemporaries of Procopius who by their hopes and fears their friendship or resentment were personally engaged jp the revolutions of Africa l That country was rapidly sinking into the state of barbarism from whence it had been raised by the Phoenician colonies and Roman laws and every step of intestine discord was marked by some deplorable victory of savage man over civilized so ciety The Moors 2 though ignorant of justice were impatient of oppression their vagrant life and boundless wilderness disappointed the arms and eluded the chains of a conqueror and experience had shown that neither oaths nor obliga tions could secure the fidelity of their attachment The victory of mount Auras had awed them into momentary submission but if they respected the character of Solomon they hated and despised the pride and luxury of his two nephews Cyrus and Sergius on whom their uncle had imprudently bestowed the provincial governments of Tripoli and Pentapolis A Moorish tribe encamped under the walls of Leptis to renew their alliance and receive from the governor the custo mary gifts Fourscore of their deputies were introduced as friends into the city but on the dark suspicion of a conspiracy they were massacred at the table of Sergius and the clamour of arms and revenge was re echoed through the valleys of mount Atlas from both the Syrtes to the Atlantic ocean A personal injury the unjust execution or murder of his brother rendered Antalus the enemy of the Romans The defeat of the Vandals had formerly signalized his valour the rudiments of justice and prudence were still more conspicuous in a Moor and while he laid Adrumetum in ashes he calmly admonished the emperor that the peace of Africa might be secured by the recall of Solomon and his unworthy ne phews The exarch led forth his troops from Carthage but at the distance of 1 Yet I must not refute him the merit of painting in lively colour the murder of Gontharis One of the

reconciliation and offered to bind himself by the most solemn oaths  By what oaths can he bind himself interrupted the indignant Moors Will he swear by the gospels the divine books of the Christians It was on those books that the faith of his nephew Sergius was pledged to eighty of our innocent and unfortunate brethren Before we trust them a second time let us try their efficacy in the chastisement of perjury and the vindication of their own honour Their honour was vindicated in the field of Tebeste by the death of Solomon and the total loss of his army The arrival of fresh troops and more skilful com manders soon checked the insolence of the Moors seventeen of their princes were slain in the same battle and the doubtful and transient submission of their tribes was celebrated with lavish applause by the people of Constantinople Suc cessive inroads had reduced the province of Africa to one third of the measure of Italy yet the Roman emperors continued to reign above a century over Carthage and the fruitful coast of the Mediterranean But the victories and the losses of Justinian were alike pernicious to mankind and such was the desolation of Africa that in many parts a stranger might wander whole days without meeting the face either of a friend or an enemy The nation of the Vandals had disappeared they once amounted to a hundred and sixty thousand warriors without including the children the women or the slaves Their numbers were infinitely surpassed by the number of the Moorish families extirpated in a relentless war and the same destruction was retaliated on the Romans and their allies who perished by the cli mate their mutual quarrels and the rage of the barbarians When Procopius first landed he admired the populousness of the cities and country strenuously exercised in the labours of commerce and agriculture In less than twenty years that busy scene was converted into a silent solitude the wealthy citizens escaped to Sicily and Constantinople and the secret historian has confidently affirmed that five millions of Africans were consumed by the wars and government of the em peror Justinian 2 The jealousy of the Byzantine court had not permitted Belisarius to achieve the conquest of Italy and his abrupt departure revived the courage of the Goths 3 who respected his genius his virtue and even the laudable motive which had ur ged the servant of Justinian to deceive and reject them They had lost their king an inconsiderable loss their capital their treasures the provinces from Sicily to the Alps and the military force of two hundred thousand barbarians magnifi cently equipped with horses and arms Yet all was not lost as long as Pavia was defended by one thousand Goths inspired by a sense of honour the love of free dom and the memory of their past greatness The supreme command was una nimously offered to the brave Uraias and it was in his eyes alone that the disgrace of his uncle Vitiges could appear as a reason of exclusion His voice inclined the election in favour of Hildibald whose personal merit was recommended by the vain hope that his kinsman Theudes the Spanish monarch would support the common interest of the Gothic nation The success of his arms in Liguria and Venetia seemed to justify their choice but he soon declared to the world that he was incapable of forgiving or commanding his benefactor The consort of Hildi bald was deeply wounded by the beauty the riches and the pride of the wife of Uraias and the death of that virtuous patriot excited the indignation of a free peo ple A bold assassin executed their sentence by striking off the head of Hildi bald in the midst of a banquet the Kugians a foreign tribe assumed the privilege of election and Totila the nephew of the late king was tempted by revenge to deliver himself and the garrison of Trevigo into the hands of the Romans But the gallant and accomplished youth was easily persuaded to prefer the Gothic throne before the

and generously undertook the restoration of the kingdom of Italy The successors of Belisarius eleven generals of equal rank neglected to crush the feeble and disunited Goths till they were roused to action by the progress of Totila and the reproaches of Justinian The gates of Verona were secretly opened to Artabazus at the head of one hundred Persians in the service of the empire The Goths fled from the city At the distance of sixty furlongs the Roman gene rals halted to regulate the division of the spoil While they disputed the enemy discovered the real number of the victors the Persians were instantly over powered and it was by leaping from the wall that Artabazus preserved a life which he lost in a few days by the lance of a barbarian who had defied him to single combat Twenty thousand Romans encountered the forces of Totila near Fxnza and on the hills of Mugello of the Florentine territory The ardour of freedmen who fought to regain their country was opposed to the languid temper of mercenary troops who were even destitute of the merits of strong and well dis ciplined servitude On the first attack they abandoned their ensigns threw down their arms and dispersed on all sides with an active speed which abated the loss â whilst it aggravated the shame of their defeat The king of the Goths who blushed for the baseness of his enemies pursued with rapid steps the path of ho nour and victory Totila passed the Po traversed the Apennine suspended the important conquest of Ravenna Florence and Rome and marched through the heart of Italy to form the siege or rather blockade of Naples The Roman chiefs imprisoned in their respective cities and accusing each other of the com mon disgrace did not presume to disturb his enterprise But the emperor alarmed by the distress and danger of his Italian conquests despatched to the re lief of Naples a fleet of galleys and a body of Thracian and Armenian soldiers They landed in Sicily which yielded its copious stores of provisions but the de lays of the new commander an unwarlike magistrate protracted the sufferings of the besieged and the succours which he dropped with a timid and tardy hand â were successively intercepted by the armed vessels stationed by Totila in the bay of Naples The principal officer of the Romans was dragged with a rope round his neck to the foot of the wall from whence with a trembling voice he exhort ed the citizens to implore like himself the mercy of the conqueror They re quested a truce with a promise of surrendering the city if no effectual relief should appear at the end of thirty days Instead of one month the audacious barbarian granted them three in the just confidence that famine would anticipate the term of their capitulation After the reduction of Naples and Cumse the provinces of  Lucania Apulia and Calabria submitted to the kins of the Goths Totila led his army to the gates of Rome pitched his camp at Tibur or Tivoli within twen ty miles of the capital and calmly exhorted the senate and people to compare the tyranny of the Greeks with the blessings of the Gothic reign The rapid success of Totila may be partly ascribed to the revolution which three years experience had produced in the sentiments of the Italians At the com mand or at least in the name of a catholic emperor the pope l their spiritual father had been torn from the Roman church and either starved or murdered on a desolate island 2 The virtues of Belisarius were replaced by the various or uniform vices of eleven chiefs at Rome Ravenna Florence Perugia Spoleto c who abused their

FALL money The subjects of Justinian who escaped these partial vexations were op pressed by the irregular maintenance of the soldiers whom Alexander defrauded and despised and their hasty sallies in quest of wealth or subsistence provoked  the inhabitants of the country to await or implore their deliverance from the vir tues of a barbarian Totila l was chaste and temperate and none were deceived either friends or enemies who depended on his faith or his clemency To the husbandmen of Italy the Gothic king issued a welcome proclamation enjoining them to pursue their important labours and to rest assured that on the payment of the ordinary taxes they should be defended by his valour and discipline from the injuries of war The strong towns he successively attacked and as soon as they had yielded to his arms he demolished the fortifications to save the people from the calamities of a future siege to deprive the Romans of the arts of defence and to decide the tedious quarrel of the two nations by an equal and honourable conflict in the field of battle The Roman captives and deserters were tempted to enlist in the service of a liberal and courteous adversary the slaves were attracted by the firm and faithful promise that they should never be delivered to their mas ters and from the thousand warriors of Pavia a new people under the same ap pellation of Goths was insensibly formed in the camp of 1 otila He sincerely ac complished the articles of capitulation without seeking or accepting any sinister advantage from ambiguous expressions or unforeseen events the garrison of Naples had stipulated that they should be transported by sea the obstinacy of the winds prevented their voyage but they were1 generously supplied with horses provisions and a safe conduct to the gates of Rome The wives of the senators who had been surprised in the villas of Campania were restored without a ransom to their husbands the violation of female chastity was inexorably chastised with death and in the salutary regulation of the diet of the famished Neapolitans the con queror assumed the office of a humane and attentive physician The virtues of Totila are equally laudable whether they proceeded from true policy religious principle or the instinct of humanity he often harangued his troops and it was his constant theme that national vice and ruin are inseparably connected that vic tory is the fruit of moral as well as military virtue and that the prince and even the people are responsible for the crimes which they neglect to punish The return of Belisarius to save the country which he had subdued was pressed with equal vehemence by his friends and enemies and the Gothic war was im posed as a trust or an exile on the veteran commander A hero on the banks of the Euphrates a slave in the palace of Constantinople he accepted with reluc tance the painful task of supporting his own reputation and retrieving the faults of his successors The sea was open to the Romans the ships and soldiers were assembled at Salona near the palace of Diocletian he refreshed and reviewed his troops at Pola in Istria coasted round the head of the Hadriatic entered the port of Ravenna and despatched orders rather than supplies to the subordinate cities His first public oration was addressed to the Goths and Romans in the name of the emperor who had suspended for awhile the conquest of Persia and listened to the prayers of his Italian subjects He gently touched on the causes and the authors of the recent disasters striving to remove the fear of punishment for the past and the hope of impunity for the future and labouring with more zeal than success to unite all the members of his government in a firm league of affection and obe dience _ Justinian his gracious master was inclined to pardon and reward and it was their interest as well as duty to reclaim their deluded brethren who had been seduced by the arts of the usurper Not a man was tempted to desert the standard of the Gothic king Belisarius soon discovered that he was sent to re main the idle and impotent spectator of the glory of a young barbarian and his own epistle exhibits a genuine and lively picture of the distress of a noble mind â Most excellent prince we are arrived in Italy destitute of all the necessary im plements of war men horses arms and money In our late circuit through the villages of Thrace and Illyrfcum we have collected with extreme difficulty about four thousand recruits naked and unskilled in the use of weapons and the exer cises of the camp The soldiers already stationed in the province are discontented fearful and dismayed at the sound of an enemy they dismiss their horses and cast their arms on the ground No taxes can be raised since Italy is in the hands of the barbarians the failure of payment has deprived us of the right of command  1 Procopins lib iii e 3 8 c does ample and willing justice to the merit of Totila The Raman histo rian from Sallustand Tacitui were happy to forget the rices of their countrymen in the contemplation of OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE V 9 or even of admonition Be assured dread sir that the greater part of your troops have already deserted to the Goths If the war could be achieved by the pre sence of Belisarius alone your wishes are satisfied Belisarius in the midst of Italy But if you desire to conquer far other preparations are requisite without a mili tary force the title of general is an empty name It would be expedient to restore to my service my own veterans and domestic guards Before I can take the field I must receive an adequate supply of light and heavy armed troops and it is only  with ready money that you can procure the indispensable aid of a powerful body of the cavalry of the HUns l An officer in whom Belisarius confided was sent from Ravenna to hasten and conduct the succours but the message was ne glected and the messenger was detained at Constantinople by an advantageous marriage After his patience had been exhausted by delay and disappointment the Roman general repassed the Hadriatic and expected at Dyrrachium the arri val of the troops which were slowly assembled among the subjects and allies of the empire His powers were still inadequate to the deliverance of Rome which was closely besieged by the Gothic king The Appian way a march of forty days was covered by the barbarians and as the prudence of Belisarius declined a battle he preferred the safe and speedy navigation of five days from the coast of Epirus to the mouth of the Tiber After reducing by force or treaty the towns of inferior note in the midland provinces of Italy Totila proceeded not to assault but to encompass and starve the ancient capital Rome was afflicted by the avarice and guarded by the va lour of Bessas a veteran chief of Gothic extraction who filled with a garrison of three thousand soldiers the spacious circle of her venerable walls From the distress of the people he extracted a profitable trade and secretly rejoiced in the continuance of the siege It was for his use that the granaries had been replen ished  the charity of pope Vigilius had purchased and embarked an ample supply of Sicilian corn but the vessels which escaped the barbarians were seized by a ra pacious governor who imparted a scanty sustenance to the soldiers and sold the remainder to the wealthy Romans The medimnus or fifth part of the quarter of wheat was exchanged for seven pieces of gold fifty pieces were given for an t X a rare and accidental prize the progress of famine enhanced this exhorbitant value and the mercenaries were tempted to deprive themselves of the allowance â which was scarcely sufficient for the support of life A tasteless and unwholesome mixture in which the bran thrice exceeded the quantity of flour appeased the hunger of the poor they were gradually reduced to feed on dead horses dogs cats and mice and eagerly to snatch the grass and even the nettles which grew among the ruins of the city A crowd of spectres pale and emaciated their bo dies oppressed with disease and their minds with despair surrounded the palace of the governor urged with unavailing truth that it was the duty of a master to maintain his slaves and humbly requested that he would provide for their sub sistence permit their flight or command their immediate execution Bessas re plied with unfeeling tranquillity that it was impossible to feed unsafe to dismiss and unlawful to kill the subjects of the emperor Yet the example of a private citizen might have shown his countrymen that a tyrant cannot withhold the privi lege of death Pierced by the cries of five children who vainly called on their fa ther for bread he ordered them to follow his steps advanced with calm and silent despair to one of the bridges of the Tiber and covering his face threw himself headlong into the stream in the presence of his family and the Roman people To the rich and pusillanimous Bessas 2 sold the permission of departure but the greatest part of the fugitives expired on the public highways or were inter cepted by the flying parties of barbarians In the meanwhile the artful govern or soothed the discontent and revived the hopes of the Romans by the vague re ports of the fleets and armies which were hastening to their relief from the extremi ties of the east They derived more rational comfort from the assurance that Belisarius had landed at the fwrt and without numbering his forces they firmly relied on the humanity the courage and the skill of their great deliverer 1 Procopius lib

more agreeable to justice than to history 1G0 THE DECLINE AND FALL The foresight of Totila had raised obstacles worthy of such an antagonist Ninety furlongs below the city in the narrowest part of the river he joined the two banks bv strong and solid timbers in the form of a bridge on which he erect ed two lofty towers manned by the bravest of his Goths and profusely stored with missile weapons and engines of offence The approach of the bridge and towers was covered by a strong and massy chain of iron and the chain at either end on the opposite side of the Tiber was defended by a numerous and chosen detach ment of archers But the enterprise of forcing these barriers and relieving the capital displays a shining example of the boldness and conduct of Belisarius His cavalry advanced from the port along the public road to awe the motions and distract the attention of the enemy His infantry and provisions were distributed in two hundred large boats and each boat was shielded by a high rampart of thick planks pierced with many small holes for the discharge of missile weapons In the front two large vessels were linked together to sustain a floating castle which commanded the towers of the bridge and contained a magazine of fire sulphur and bitumen The whole fleet which the general led in person was laboriously moved against the current of the river The chain yielded to their weight and the enemies who guarded the banks were either slain or scattered As soon as they touched the principal barrier the fire ship was instantly grappled to the bridge one of the towers with two hundred Goths was consumed by the flames the assailants shouted the victory and Rome was saved if the wisdom of Belisa rius had not been defeated by the misconduct of his officers He had previously sent orders to Bessas to second his operations by a timely sally from the town and he had fixed his lieutenant Isaac by a peremptory command to the station of the port But avarice rendered Bessas immoveable while the youthful ardour of Isaac delivered him into the hands of a superior enemy The exaggerated rumour of his defeat was hastily carried to the ears of Belisarius he paused betrayed in that single moment of his life some emotions of surprise and perplexity and reluc tantly sounded a retreat to save his wife Antonina his treasures and the only har bour which he possessed on the Tuscan coast The vexation of his mind produced an ardent and almost mortal fever and Rome was left without protection to the mercy or indignation of Totila The continuance of hostilities had imbittered the national hatred the Arian clergy was ignominiously driven from Rome Pelagius the archdeacon returned without success from an embassy to the Gothic camp and a Sicilian bishop the envoy or nuncio of the pope was deprived of both his hands for daring to utter falsehoods in the service of the church and state Famine had relaxed the strength and discipline of the garrison of Rome They could derive no effectual service from a dying people and the inhuman avarice of the merchant at length absorbed the vigilance of the governor Four Isaurian sentinels while their companions slept and their officers were absent descended by a rope from the wall and secretly proposed to the Gothic king to introduce his troops into the city The offer was entertained with coldness and suspicion they returned in safety they twice repeated their visit the place was twice exa mined the conspiracy was known and disregarded and no sooner had Totila con sented to the attempt than they unbarred the Asinarian gate and gave admittance to the Goths Till the dawn of day they halted in order of battle apprehensive of treachery or ambush but the troops of Bessas with their leader had already escaped and when the king was pressed to disturb their retreat he prudently re plied that no sight could be more grateful than that of a flying enemy The pa tricians who were still possessed of horses Decius Basilius 8cc accompanied the governor their brethren among whom Olybrius Orestes and Maximus are named by the historian took refuge in the church of St Peter but the assertion that only five hundred persons remained in the capital inspires some doubt of the fidelity either of his narrative or of his text As soon as daylight had displayed the entire victory of the Goths their monarch devoutly visited the tomb of the prince of the apostles but while he prayed at the altar twenty five soldiers and sixty citizens were put to the sword in the vestibule of the temple The archdeacon Pelagius l stood before him with the gospel in his hand  O Lord be merciful to your servant Pelagius said To 1 During the low exile rind after the death of Vigilius the Roman church was governed at first by the

lives of the Romans were spared and the chastity of the maids and matrons was preserved inviolate from the passions of the hungry soldiers But they were rewarded by the freedom of pillage after the most precious spoils had been reserved for the royal treasury The nouses of the senators were plentifully stored with gold and silver and the avarice of Bessas had laboured with so much guilt and shame for the benefit of the conqueror In this revolution the sons and daughters of Roman consuls tasted the misery which they had spurned or relieved wandered in tattered garments through the streets of the city and begged their bread perhaps without success before the gates of their hereditary mansions The riches of Rusticiana the daughter of Symmachus and widow of Boethius had been generously devoted to alleviate the calamities of famine But the barbarians were exasperated by the report that she had prompted the people to overthrow the statues of the great Theodoric and the life of that venerable matron would have been sacrificed to his memory if Totila had not respected her birth her virtues and even the pious motive of her revenge The next day he pronounced two orations to congratulate and admonish his victorious Goths and reproach the senate as the vilest of slaves with their perjury folly and ingratitude sternly declaring that their estates and honours were justly forfeited to the companions of his arms Yet he consented to forgive their revolt and the senators repaid his clemency by despatching circular letters to their tenants and vassals in the pro vinces of Italy strictly to enjoin them to desert the standard of the Greeks to cul tivate their lands in peace and to learn from their masters the duty of obedience to a Gothic sovereign Against the cities which had so long delayed the course of his victories he appeared inexorable one third of the walls in different parts â were demolished by his command fire and engines prepared to consume or sub vert the most stately works of antiquity and the world was astonished by the fa tal decree that Rome should be changed into a pasture for cattle The firm and temperate remonstrance of Belisarius suspended the execution he warned the barbarian not to sully his fame by the destruction of those monuments which were the glory of the dead and the delight of the living and Totila was persuaded by the advice of an enemy to preserve Rome as the ornament of his kingdom or the fairest pledge of peace and reconciliation When he had signified to the am bassadors of Belisarius his intention of sparing the city he stationed an army at the distance of one hundred and twenty furlongs to observe the motions of the Ro man general With the remainder of his forces he marched into Lucania and Apulia and occupied on the summit of mount Garganus l one of the camps of Hannibal 2 The senators were dragged in his train and afterwards confined in the fortresses of Campania the citizens with their wives and children were dis persed in exile and during forty days Rome was abandoned to desolate and dreary solitude 3 The loss of Rome was speedily retrieved by an action to which according to the event the public opinion would apply the names of rashness or heroism After the departure of Totila the Roman general sallied from the port at the head of a thousand horse cut in pieces the enemy who opposed his progress and visited with pity and reverence the vacant space of the eternal city Resolved to maintain a station so conspicuous in the eyes of mankind he summoned the greatest part of his troops to the standard which he erected on the capital the old inhabitants were recalled by the love of their country and the hopes of food and the keys of Rome were sent a second time to the emperor Justinian

annoy the feet of the horses and as new gates could not suddenly be procured the entrance was guarded by a Spartan rampart of his bravest soldiers At the expiration of twenty five days Totila returned by hasty marches from Apu lia to avenge the injury and disgrace Belisarius expected his approach The Goths were thrice repulsed in three general assaults they lost the flower of their troops the royal standard had almost fallen into the hands of the enemy and the Fame of Totila sunk as it had risen with the fortune of his arms Vhatever skill and courage could achieve had been performed by the Roman general it remained only that Justinian should terminate by a strong and seasonable effort the war which he had ambitiously undertaken The indolence perhaps the im potence of a prince who despised his enemies and envied his servants protracted the calamities of Italy After a long silence Belisarius was commanded to leave a sufficient garrison at Rome and to transport himself into the province of Luca nia whose inhabitants inflamed by catholic zeal had cast away the yoke of their  Arian conquerors In this ignoble warfare the hero invincible against the power of the barbarians was basely vanquished by the delay the disobedience and the cowardice of his own officers He reposed in his winter quarters of Crotona in the full assurance that the two passes of the Lucanian hills were guarded by his cavalry They were betrayed by treachery or weakness and the rapid march of the Goths scarcely allowed time for the escape of Belisarius to the coast of Si cily At length a fleet and army were assembled for the relief of Ruscianum or Rossano l a fortress sixty furlongs from the ruins of Sybaris where the nobles of Lucania had taken refuge In the first attempt the Roman forces were dissi Eated by a storm In the second they approached the shore but they saw the ills covered with archers the landing place defended by a line of spears and the king of the Goths impatient for battle The conqueror of Italy retired with a sigh and continued to languish inglorious and inactive till Antonina who had been sent to Constantinople to solicit succours obtained after the death of the em press the permission of his return The five last campaigns of Belisarius might abate the envy of his competitors whose eyes had been dazzled and wounded by the blaze of his former glory In stead of delivering Italy from the Goths he had wandered like a fugitive along the coast without daring to march into the country or to accept the bold and re peated challenge of Totila Yet in the judgment of the few who could discriminate counsels from events and compare the instruments with the execution he ap peared a more consummate master of the art of war than in the season of his prosperity when he presented two captive kings before the throne of Justinian The valour of Belisarius was not chilled by age his prudence was matured by experience but the moral virtues of humanity and justice seem to have yielded to the hard necessity of the times The parsimony or poverty of the emperor compelled him to deviate from the rule of conduct which had deserved the love and confidence of the Italians The war was maintained by the oppression of Ra venna Sicily and all the faithful subjects of the empire and the rigorous prosecution of Herodian provoked that injured or guilty officer to deliver Spoleto into the hands of the enemy The avarice of Antonina which had been sometimes diverted by love now reigned without a rival in her breast Belisarius himself had always understood that riches in a corrupt age are the support and ornament of per sonal merit And it cannot be presumed that he should stain his honour for the public service without applying a part of the spoil to his private emolument The hero had escaped the sword of the barbarians but the dagger of conspiracy 2 awaited his return In the midst of wealth aid honours Ai iiaban who had chas tised the African tyrant complained of the ingratitude of courts He aspired to Prsejecta the emperor s niece who wished to reward her deliverer but the im pediment of his previous marriage was asserted by the piety of Theodora The pride of royal descent was irritated by flattery and the service in which he gloried had proved him capable of bold and sanguinary deeds The death of Justinian â was resolved but the

entertained of shaking his long tried fidelity and they justly dreaded the revenge or rather justice of the veteran general who might speedily assemble an army in Thrace to punish the assassins and perhaps to enjoy the fruits of their crime Delay afforded time for rash communications and honest confessions Ar taban and his accomplices were condemned by the senate but the extreme cle mency of Justinian detained them in the gentle confinement of the palace till he pardoned their flagitious attempt against his throne and life If the emperor for gave his enemies he must cordially embrace a friend whose victories were alone remembered and who was endeared to his prince by the recent circumstance of their common danger Belisarius reposed from his toils in the high station of ge neral of the east and count of the domestics and the older consuls and patricians respectfully yielded the precedency of rank to the peerless merit of the first of the Romans 1 The first of the Romans still submitted to be the slave of his wife but the servitude of habit and affection became less disgraceful when the death of Theodora had removed the baser influence of fear Joannina their  daughter and the sole heiress of their fortunes was betrothed to Anastasius the grandson or rather nephew of the empress 2 whose kind interposition forward ed the consummation of their youthful loves But the power of Theodora ex pired the parents of Joannina returned and her honour perhaps her happi ness were sacrificed to the revenge of an unfeeling mother who dissolved the imperfect nuptials before they had been ratified by the ceremonies of the church 3 Before the departure of Belisarius Perusia was besieged and few cities were impregnable to the Gothic arms Ravenna Ancona and Crotona still resisted the barbarians and when Totila asked in marriage one of the daughters of France he was stung by the just reproach that the king of Italy was unworthy of his title till it was acknowledged by the Roman people Three thousand of the bravest soldiers had been left to defend the capital On the suspicion of a monopoly they massacred the governor and announced to Justinian by a deputation of the cler gy that unless their offence was pardoned and their arrears were satisfied they should instantly accept the tempting offers of Totila But the officer who suc ceeded to the command his name was Diogenes deserved their esteem and con fidence and the Goths instead of finding an easy conquest encountered a vigo rous resistance from the soldiers and people who patiently endured the loss of the port and of all maritime supplies The siege of Rome would perhaps have been raised if the liberality of Totila to the Isaurians had not encouraged some of their venal countrymen to copy the example of treason In a dark night while the Gothic trumpet sounded on another side they silently opened the gate of St Paul the barbarians rushed into the city and the flying garrison was inter cepted before they could reach the harbour of Centumcellx A soldier trained in the school of Belisarius Paul of Cilicia retired with four hundred men to the mole of Hadrian They repelled the Goths but they felt the approach of famine and their aversion to the taste of horse flesh confirmed their resolution to risk the event of a desperate and decish 3 sally But their spirit insensibly stooped to the offers of capitulation they retrieved their arrears of pay and preserved their arms and horses by enlisting in the service of Totila their chiefs who pleaded a laudable attachment to their wives and children in the east were dismissed with honour and above four hundred enemies who had taken refuge in the sanc tuaries were saved by the clemency of the victor He no longer entertained a wish of destroying the

The cities of Rhegium and Tarentum were reduced he passed into Sicily the ob ject of his implacable resentment and the island was stripped of its gold and sil ver of the fruits of the earth and of an infinite number of horses sheep and oxen Sardinia and Corsica obeyed the fortune of Italy and the sea coast of Greece was visited by a fleet of three hundred galleys 1 The Goths were landed in Corcyra and the ancient continent of Epirus they advanced as far as Nicopolis the trophy of Augustus and Dodona 2 once favoured by the oracle of Jove In every step of his victories the wise barbarian repeated to Justinian his desire of peace applauded the concord of their predecessors and offered to employ the Gothic arms in the service of the empire Justinian was deaf to the voice of peace but he neglected the prosecution of war and the indolence of his temper disappointed in some degree the obstinacy of his passions From this salutary slumber the emperor was awakened by the pope Vigilius and the patrician Cethegus who appeared before his throne and adjured him in the name of God and the people to resume the conquest and deliverance of Italy In the choice of the generals caprice as well as judgment was shown A fleet and army sailed for the relief of Sicily under the conduct of Liberius but his youth and want of experience were afterwards discovered and before he touched the shores of the island he was overtaken by his successor In the place of Liberius the conspirator Artaban was raised from a prison to military honours in the pious presumption that gratitude would animate his valour and fortify his allegiance Belisarius reposed in the shade of his laurels but the command of the principal army was reserved for Germanus 3 the emperor s nephew whose rank and merit had been long depressed by the jealousy of the court Theodora had injured him in the rights of a private citizen the marriage of his children and the testament of his brother and although his conduct was pure and blameless Justinian was displeased that he should be thought worthy of the confidence of the malecontents The life of Germanus was alesson of implicit obe dience  he nobly refused to prostitute his name and character in the factions of the circus the gravity of his manners was tempered by innocent cheerfulness and his riches were lent without interest to indigent or deserving friends His valour had formerly triumphed over the Sclavonians of the Danube and the rebels of Af rica the first report of his promotion revived the hopes of the Italians and he was privately assured that a crowd of Roman deserters would abandon on his ap proach the standard of Totila His second marriage with Malasontha the grand daughter of Theodoric en deared Germanus to the Goths themselves and they marched with reluctance against the father of a royal infant the last offspring of the line of Amali 4 A splendid allowance was assigned by the emperor the general contributed his pri vate fortune his two sons were popular and active and he surpassed in the promp titude and success of his levies the expectation of mankind He was permitted to select some squadrons of Thracian cavalry the veterans as well as the youth of Constantinople and Europe engaged their voluntary service and as far as the heart of Germany his fame and liberality attracted the aid of the barbarians The Romans advanced to Sardica an army of Sclavonians fled before their march but within two days of their final departure the designs of Germanus were termi nated by his malady and death Yet the impulse which he had given

been employ ed in the management of the loom and distaff in the cares of the household and the service of female luxury but while his hands were busy he secretly ex ercised the faculties of a vigorous and discerning mind A stranger to the schools and the camp he studied in the palace to dissemble to flatter and to persuade and as soon as he approached the person of the emperor Justinian listened with surprise and pleasure to the manly counsels of his cnamberlain and private trea surer The talents of Narses were tried and improved in frequent embassies he led an army into Italy acquired a practical knowledge of the war and the coun try and presumed to strive with the genius of Belisarius Twelve years after his return the eunuch was chosen to achieve the conquest which had been left im perfect by the first of the Roman generals Instead of being dazzled by vanity or emulation he seriously declared that unless he were armed with an adequate force he would never consent to risk his own glory and that of his sovereign Justinian granted to the favourite what he might nave denied to the hero the Gothic war was rekindled from its ashes and the preparations were not unwor thy of the ancient majesty of the empire The key of the public treasure was put into his hand to collect magazines to levy soldiers to purchase arms and horses to discharge the arrears of pay and to tempt the fidelity of the fugitives and de serters The troops of Germanus were still in arms they halted at Salona in the expectation of a new leader the legions of subjects and allies were created by the well

and the nations untrained to discipline or fatigue might be rashly provoked to turn their arms against each other or against their benefactor The same considerations might have tempered the ardour of Totila But he was con scious that the clergy and people of Italy aspired to a second revolution he felt or suspected the rapid progress oftreason and he resolved to risk the Gothic kingdom on the chance of a day in which the valiant would be animated by instant danger and the disaffected might be awed by mutual ignorance In his march from Ra venna the Roman general chastised the garrison of

day said the messenger  will you fix for the combat The eighth day replied Totila but early the next morning he attempted to surprise a foe suspicious of deceit and prepared for battle Ten thousand Heruli and Lombards of approved valour and doubtful faith were placed in the centre Each of the wings was composed of eight thousand Romans the right was guarded by the cavalry of the Huns the left was covered by fifteen hun dred chosen horse destined according to the emergencies of action to sustain the retreat of their friends or to encompass the flank of the enemy From his prc Ser station at

of robbers and exposing to their view gold chains collars and bracelets the rewards of military virtue From the event of a single combat they drew an omen of success and they beheld with pleasure the courage of fifty archers who maintained a small eminence against three successive attacks of the Gothic cavalry At the distance only of two bow shots the armies spent the morning in dreadful suspense and the Romans tasted some necessary food without unloosening the cuirass from their breast or the bridle from their horses Narses awaited the charge and it was delayed by Totila till he had received

the horns of a crescent into which the adverse wings had been insensibly curved and were saluted from either side by the volleys of four thousand archers Their ardour and even their distress drove them for wards to a close and unequal conflict in which they could only use their lances against an enemy equally skilled in all the instruments of war A generous emu lation inspired the Romans and their barbarian allies and Narses who calmly viewed and directed their efforts doubted to whom he should adjudge the prize of superior bravery The Gothic cavalry was astonished and disordered pressed

of Totila The blow was instantly revenged by the faithful Goths they trans ported their dying monarch seven miles beyond the scene of his disgrace and his last moments were not imbittered by the presence of an enemy Compassion af forded him the shelter of an obscure tomb but the Romans were not satisfied of their victory till they beheld the corpse of the Gothic king His hat enriched with gems and his bloody robe were presented to Justinian by the messengers of triumph 1 As soon as Narses had paid his devotions to the anthnr of victory and the blessed Virgin his peculiar patroness 2 he praised rewarded and dismissed the Lom bards The villages had been reduced to ashes by these valiant savages they ra vished matrons and virgins on the altar their retreat was diligently watched by a strong detachment of regular forces who prevented a repetition of the like disor ders The victorious eunuch pursued his march through Tuscany accepted the submission of the Goths heard the acclamations and often the complaints of the Italians and encompassed the walls of Rome with the remainder of his formidable host Round the wide circumference Narses assigned to himself and to each of his lieutenants a real or a feigned attack while he silently marked the place of easy and unguarded entrance Neither the fortifications of Hadrian s mole nor of the port could long delay the progress of the conqueror and Justinian once more received the keys of Rome which under his reign had been five times taken and recovered 3 But the deliverance of Rome was the last calamity of the Roman people The barbarian allies of Narses too frequently confounded the privileges of peace and war the despair of the flying Goths found some consolation in sangui nary revenge and three hundred youths of the noblest families who had been sent as hostages beyond the Po were inhumanly slain by the successor of Totila The fate of the senate suggests an awful lesson of the vicissitude of human affairs Of the senators whom Totila had banished from their country some were rescued by an officer of Belisarius and transported from Campania to Sicily while others were too guilty to confide in the clemency of Justinian or too poor to provide horses for their escape to the sea shore Their brethren languished five years in a state of indigence and exile the victory of Narses revived their hopes but their prema ture return to the metropolis was prevented by the furious Goths and all the fortresses of Campania were ruined with patrician 4 blood After a period of thir teen centuries the institution of

ad vanced to the relief of his brother eluded the vigilance of the Roman chiefs and pitched his camp on the banks of the Sarnus or Draco l which flows from Nu ceria into the bay of Naples The river separated the two armies sixty days were consumed in distant and fruitless combats and Teias maintained this impor tant post till he was deserted by his fleet and the hope of subsistence With re luctant steps he ascended the Lactarian mount where the physicians of Rome since the time of Galen had sent their patients for the benefit of the air and the milk 2 But the Goths soon embraced a more generous resolution to descend the hill to dismiss their horses and to die in arms and in the possession of free dom The king marched at their head bearing in his right hand a lance and an ample buckler in his left with the one he struck dead the foremost of the assail ants with the other he received the weapons which every hand was ambitious to aim against his life After a combat of many hours his left arm was fatigued by the weight of twelve javelins which hung from his shield Without moving from his ground or suspending his blows the hero called aloud on his attendants for a fresh buckler but in the moment while his side was uncovered it was pierced by a mortal dart He fell and his head exalted on a spear proclaimed to the na tions that the Gothic kingdom was no more But the example of his death served only to animate the companions who had sworn to perish with their leader They fought till darkness descended on the earth They reposed on their arms The combat was renewed with the return of light and maintained with unabated vigour till the evening of the second day The repose of a second night the want of wa ter and the loss of their bravest champions determined the surviving Goths to accept the fair capitulation which the prudence of Narses was inclined to propose They embraced the alternative of residing in Italy as the subjects and soldiers of Justinian or departing with a portion of their private wealth in search of some independent country 3 Yet the oath of fidelity or exile was alike rejected by one thousand Goths who broke away before the treaty was signed and boldly effect ed their retreat to the walls of Pavia The spirit as well as the situation of Ali gern prompted him to imitate rather than to bewail his brother a strong and dexterous archer he transpierced with a single arrow the armour and breast of his antagonist and his military conduct defended Cuma 4 above a year against the forces of the Romans Their industry had scooped the Sibyl s cave 5 into a prodigious mine combustible materials were introduced to consume the temporary props the wall and the gate of Cumic sunk into the cavern but the ruins formed a deep and inaccessible precipice On the fragment of a rock Aligern stood alone and unshaken till he calmly surveyed the hopeless condition of his country and judged it more honourable to be the friend of Narses than the slave of the Franks After the death of Teias the Roman general separated his troops to reduce the cities of Italy Lucca sustained a long and vigorous siege and such was the humani ty or the prudence of Narses that the repeated perfidy of the inhabitants could not prov okc him to exact the forfeit lives of their hostages These hostages were 1 Tlie bpx vv of Prncopius Goth lib iv e 35 is evidently

overwhelmed by a new deluge of bar barians A feeble youth the grandson of Clovis reigned over the Austrasians or oriental Franks The guardians of Theodebald entertained with coldness and re luctance the magnificent promises of the Gothic ambassadors But the spirit of a martial people outstripped the timid counsels of the court two brothers Lo thaire and Buccelin 2 the dukes of the Alemanni stood forth as the leaders of the Italian war and seventy five thousand Germans descended in the autumn from the Rhsetian Alps into the plain of Milan The vanguard of the Roman army was stationed near the Po under the conduct of Fulcaris a bold Herulian who rashly conceived that personal bravery was the sole duty and merit of a com mander As he marched without order or precaution along the jf milian way an ambuscade of Franks suddenly arose from the amphitheatre of Parma his troops were surprised and routed but their leader refused to fly declaring to the last moment that death was less terrible than the angry countenance of Narses The death of Fulcaris and the retreat of the surviving chiefs decided the fluctuating and rebellious temper of the Goths they flew to the standard of their deliverers and admitted them into the cities which still resisted the arms of the Roman ge neral The conqueror of Italy opened a free passage to the irresistible torrent of barbarians They passed under the walls of Cesena and answered by threats and reproaches the advice of Aligern that the Gothic treasures could no longer repay the labour of an invasion Two thousand Franks were destroyed by the skill and valour of Narses himself who sallied from Rimini at the head of three hundred horse to chastise the licentious rapine of their march On the confines of Samnium the two brothers divided their forces With the right wing Buc celin assumed the spoil of Campania Lucania and Bruttium with the left Lo thaire accepted the plunder of Apulia and Calabria They followed the coast of the Mediterranean and the Hadriatic as far as Rhegium and Otranto and the extreme lands of Italy were the term of their destructive progress The Franks who were Christians and catholics contented themselves with pillage and occa sional murder But the churches which their piety had spared were stripped by the sacrilegious hands of the Alemanni who sacrificed horses heads to their native deities of the woods and rivers 3 they melted or profaned the consecrated vessels and the ruins pi shrines and altars were stained with the blood of the faithful Buccelin was actuated by ambition and Lothaire by avarice The former aspired to restore the Gothic kingdom the latter after a promise to his brother of speedy succours returned by the same road to deposite his trea sure beyond the Alps The strength of their army was already wasted by the change of climate and contagion of disease the Germans revelled in the vintage of Italy and their own intemperance avenged in some degree the miseries of a defenceless people At the entrance of the spring the imperial troops who had guarded the cities assembled to the number of eighteen thousand men in the neighbourhood of Rome Their winter hours had not been consumed in idleness By the command and after the example of Narses they repeated each day their military exercise on foot and on horse back accustomed their ear to obey the sound of the trumpet and practised the steps and evolutions of the Pyrrhic dance From the straits of Sicily Buccelin with thirty thousand Franks and Alemanni slowly moved to wards Capua occupied with a wooden tower the bridge of Casilinum covered his right by the stream of the Vulturnus and secured the rest of his encampment by a rampart of sharp stakes and a circle of wagons whose wheels were buried in

were anxiously fixed on the event of this final contest Perhaps the talents of the Roman general were most conspicuous in the calm operations which precede the tumult of a battle His skilful movements intercepted the subsist ence of the barbarian deprived him of the advantage of the bridge and river and in the choice of the ground and moment of action reduced him to comply â with the inclination of his enemy On the morning of the important day when the ranks were already formed a servant for some trivial fault was killed by his master one of the leaders of the Heruli The justice or passion of Narses was awakened he summoned the offender to his presence and without listening to his excuses gave the signal to the minister of death If the cruel master had not infringed the laws of his nation this arbitrary execution was not less unjust than it appears to have been imprudent The Heruli felt the indignity they halted but the Roman general without soothing their rage or expecting their resolution called aloud as the trumpets sounded that unless they hastened to oc cupy their place they would lose the honour of the victory His troops were dis posed in a long front the cavalry on the wings in the centre the heavy armed foot the archers and slingers in the rear The Germans advanced in a sharp pointed column of the form of a triangle or solid wedge They pierced the feeble ceptre of Narses who received them with a smile into the fatal snare and directed his wings of cavalry insensibly to wheel on their flanks and encompass the rear The hosts of the Franks and Alemanni consisted of infantry a sword and buckler hung by their side and they used as their weapons of offence a weighty hatchet and hooked javelin which were only formidable in close combat or at a short dis tance The flower of the Roman archers on horseback and in complete ar mour skirmished without peril round this immoveable phalanx supplied by ac tive speed the deficiency of number and aimed their arrows against a crowd of barbarians who instead of a cuirass and helmet were covered by a loose garment of fur or linen They paused they trembled their ranks were confounded and in the decisive moment the Heruli preferring glory to revenge charged with ra pid violence the head of the column Their leader Sindbal and Aligern the Gothic prince deserved the prize of superior valour and their example incited the victorious troops to achieve with swords and spears the destruction of the ene my Buccelin and the greatest part of his army perished on the field of battle in the waters of Vulturnus or by the hands of the enraged peasants but it may seem incredible that a victory 2 which no more than five of the Alemanni sur vived could be purchased with the loss of fourscore Romans Seven thousand Goths the relics of the war defended the fortress of Campsa till the ensuing spring and every messenger of Narses announced the reduction of the Italian ci ties whose names were corrupted by the ignorance or vanity of the Greeks 3 After the battle of Casilinum Narses entered the capital the arms and treasures of the Goths the Franks and Alemanni were displayed his soldiers with gar lands in their hands chanted the praises of the conqueror and Rome for the last time beheld the semblance of a triumph After a reign of sixty years the throne of the Gothic kings was filled by the ex archs of Ravenna the representatives in peace and war of the emperor of the Ro mans Their jurisdiction was soon reduced to the limits of a narrow province but Narses himself the first and most powerful of the exarcfis administered about fifteen years the entire kingdom of Italy Like Belisarius he had deserved the honours of envy calumny and disgrace but the favourite eunuch still enjoyed the confidence of Justinian or the leader of a victorious army awed and repressed the ingratitude of a timid court Yet it was not by weak and mischievous indul gence that Narses secured the attachment of his troops Forgetful of the past and regardless of the future they abused the present hour of prosperity and peace The cities of Italy resounded with the noise of drinking and dancing the spoils of victory were wasted in sensual pleasures and nothing says Agathias remained unless to exchange their shields and helmets for the soft lute and capacious hogs 1 Pere Daniel Hist dela Milice Fnwcoise torn i p 17â 21

operations of antiquity 2 Agathias lib ii p 47 has produced a Greek epirram of six lines on this victory of Narses which is fa vourably compared to the battles of Marathon aud Plataea The_ chief difference is indeed in their conse quencesâ so triviaMn the former instanceâ so permanent and glorious in the latter 3 The Beroi and Brincas of Theophanes or his transcriber p 201 mast be read or understood Verona and Brixia OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE ill heads 1 In a manly oration not unworthy of a Roman censor the eunuch re proved these disorderly vices which sullied their fame and endangered their safety The soldiers blushed and obeyed discipline was confirmed the fortifica tions were restored a duke was stationed for the defence and military command of each of the principal cities 2 and the eye of Narses pervaded the ample pros pect from Calabria to the Alps The remains of the Gothic nation evacuated the country or mingled with the people the Franks instead of revenging the death of Buccelin abandoned without a struggle their Italian conquests and the re bellious Sindbal chief of the Heruli was subdued taken and hung on a lofty gal lows by the inflexible justice of the exarch 3 The civil state of Italy after the agitation of a long tempest was fixed by a pragmatic faction which the empe ror promulgated at the request of the pope Justinian introduced his own Juris prudence into the schools and tribunals of the west he ratified the acts of Theo doric and his immediate successors but every deed was rescinded and abolished which force had extorted or fear had subscribed under the usurpation of Totila A moderate theory was framed to reconcile the rights of property with the safety of prescription the claims of the state with the poverty of the people and the pardon of offences with the interest of virtue and order of society Under the ex archs of Ravenna Rome was degraded to the second rank Yet the senators were gratified by the permission of visiting their estates in Italy and of approach ing without obstacle the throne of Constantinople the regulation of weights and measures was delegated to the pope and senate and the salaries of lawyers and physicians of orators and grammarians were destined to preserve or rekindle the light of science in the ancient capital Justinian might dictate benevolent edicts 4 and Narses might second his wishes by the restoration of cities and more especial ly of churches But the power of kings is most effectual to destroy and the twen ty years of the Gothic war had consummated the distress and depopulation of Ita ly As early as the fourth campaign under the discipline of Belisarius himself fifty thousand labourers died of hunger 5 in the narrow region of Picenum 6 and a strict interpretation of the evidence of Procopius would swell the loss of Ita ly above the total sum of her present inhabitants 7 I desire to believe but I dare not affirm that Belisarius sincerely rejoiced in the triumph of Narses Yet the consciousness of his own exploits might teach him to esteem without jealousy the merit of a rival and the repose of the aged warrior was crowned by a last victory which saved the emperor and the capital The barbarians who annually visited the provinces of Europe were less discouraged by some accidental defeats than they were excited by the double hope of spoil and of subsidy In the thirty second winter of Justinian s reign the Danube was deep ly frozen Zabergan led the cavalry of the Bulgarians and his standard was fol lowed by a promiscuous multitude of Sclavonians The savage chief passed with out opposition the river and the mountains spread his troops over Macedonia and Thrace and advanced with no more than seven thousand horse to the long walls which should have defended the territory of Constantinople But the works of man are impotent against the assaults of nature a recent earthquake had shaken the foundations of the wall and the forces of the empire were employed on

AND FALL of guards or domestic troops had been augmented to the number of five thousand five hundred men whose ordinary station was in the peaceful cities of Asia But the places of the brave Armenians were insensibly supplied by lazy citizens who purchased an exception from the duties of civil life without being exposed to the danger of military service Of such soldiers few could be tempted to sally from the gates and none could be persr aded to remain in the field unless they wanted strength and speed to escape from the Bulgarians The report of the fugitives ex aggerated the numbers and fierceness of an enemy who had polluted holy virgins and abandoned new born infants to the dogs and vultures a crowd of rustics im ploring food and protection increased the consternation of the city and the tents of Zabergen were pitched at the distance of twenty miles l on the banks of a small river which encircles Melanthius and afterwards falls into the Propontis 2 Justinian trembled and those who had only seen the emperor in his old age were pleased to suppose that he had lost the alacrity and vigour of his youth By his command the vessels of gold and silver were removed from the churches in the neighbourhood and even the suburbs of Constantinople the ramparts were lined with trembling spectators the golden gate was crowded with useless generals and tribunes and the senate shared the fatigues and the apprehensions of the popu lace But the eyes of the prince and people were directed to a feeble veteran who was compelled by the public danger to resume the armour in which he had entered Carthage and defended Rome The horses of the royal stables of private citizens and even of the circus were hastily collected the emulation of the old and young was roused by the name of Belisarius and his first encampment was in the presence ef a victorious enemy His prudence and the labour of the friendly peasants se cured with a ditch and rampart the repose of the night innumerable fires and clouds of dust were artfully contrived to magnify the opinion of his strength his soldiers suddenly passed from despondency to presumption and while ten thou sand voices demanded the battle Belisarius dissembled his knowledge that in the hour of trial he must depend on the firmness of three hundred veterans The next morning the Bulgarian cavalry advanced to the charge But they heard the shouts of multitudes they beheld the arms and discipline of the front they were assaulted on the flanks by two ambuscades which rose from the woods their fore most warriors fell by the hand of the aged hero and his guards and the swiftness of their evolutions was rendered useless by the close attack and rapid pursuit of the Romans In this action so speedy was their flight the Bulgarians lost only four hundred horse but Constantinople was saved and Zabergan who felt the hand of a master withdrew to a respectful distance But his friends were nume rous in the councils of the emperor and Belisarius obeyed with reluctance the commands of envy and Justinian which forbade him to achieve the deliverance of his country On his return to the city the people still conscious of their danger accompanied his triumph with acclamations of joy and gratitude which were im puted as a crime to the victorious general But when he entered the palace the courtiers were silent and the emperor after a cold and thankless embrace dis missed him to mingle with the train of slaves Yet so deep was the impression of his glory on the minds of men that Justinian in the seventy seventh year of his age was encouraged to advance near forty miles from the capital and to inspect in person the restoration of the long wall The Bulgarians wasted the summer in the plains of Thrace but they were inclined to peace by the failure of their rash attempts on Greece and the Chersonesus A menace of killing their prisoners quickened the payment of heavy ransoms and the departure of Zabergan was hastened by the report that double prowed vessels were built on the Danube to intercept his passage The danger was soon forgotten and a vain question whe ther their sovereign had shown more wisdom or weakness amused the idleness of the city 3 About two years after the last victory of Belisarius the emperor returned from 1 The distance from Constantinople to MebuitUas Villa Ctesariana Ammian Mftrcellin 30 11 is va

or business or devotion Justiiiian was afflicted by a pain in his head and his private entry countenanced the rumour of his death Be fore the third hour of the day the bakers shops were plundered of their bread the houses were shut up and every citizen with hope or terror prepared for the impending tumult The senators themselves fearful and suspicious were convened at the ninth hour and the prefect received their commands to visit every quarter of the city and proclaim a general illumination for the recovery of the emperor s health The ferment subsided but every accident betrayed the impo tence of the government and the factious temper of the people the guards were disposed to mutiny as often as their quarters were changed or their pay was with held the frequent calamities of fires and earthquakes afforded the opportunities of disorder the disputes of the blues and greens of the orthodox and heretics de generated into bloody battles and in the presence of the Persian ambassador Jus tinian blushed for himself and for his subjects Capricious pardon and arbitrary punishment imbittered the irksomeness and discontent of a long reign a conspira cy was formed in the palace and unless we are deceived by the names of Mar cellus and Sergius the most virtuous and the most profligate of the courtiers were associated in the same designs They had fixed the time of the execution their rank gave them access to the royal banquet and their black slaves l were stationed in the vestibule and porticos to announce the death of the tyrant and to excite a sedition in the capital But the indiscretion of an accomplice saved the poor rem nant of the days of Justinian The conspirators were detected and seized with daggers hidden under their garments Marcellus died by his own hand and Ser gius was dragged from the sanctuary 2 Pressed by remorse or tempted by the hopes of safety he accused two officers of the household of Belisarius and tor ture forced them to declare that they had acted according to the secret instruc tions of their patron 3 Posterity will not hastily believe that a hero who in the vigour of life had disdained the fairest offers of ambition and revenge should stoop to the murder of his prince whom he could not long expect to survive His followers were impatient to fly but flight must have been supported by rebellion and he had lived enough for nature and for glory Belisarius appeared before the council with less fear than indignation after forty years service the emperor had prejudged his guilt and injustice was sanctified by the presence and authori ty of the patriarch The life of Belisarius was graciously spared but his fortunes were sequestered and from December to July he was guarded as a prisoner in his own palace At length his innocence was acknowledged his freedom and ho nours were restored and death which might be hastened by resentment and grief removed him from the world about eight months after his deliverance The name of Belisarius can never die but instead of the funeral the monuments the statues so justly due to his memory I only read that his treasures the spoils of the Goths and Vandals were immediately confiscated by the emperor Some de cent portion was reserved however for the use of his widow and as Antonina  had much to repent she devoted the last remains of her life and fortune to the foundation of a convent Such is the simple and genuine narrative of the fall of Belisarius and the ingratitude of Justinian 4 That he was deprived of his eyes and reduced by envy to beg his bread  Give a penny to Belisarius the general is a fiction of later times 5 which has obtained credit or rather favour as a strange example of the vicissitude of fortune 1 1 IvJous They could scarcely

life of eighty three years It would be difficult to trace the character of a prince who is not the most conspicuous object of his own times but the confessions of an ene my may be received as the safest evidence of his virtues The resemblance of Justinian to the bust of Domitian is maliciously urged 2 with the acknowledg ment however of a well proportioned figure a ruddy complexion and a pleasing countenance The emperor was easy of access patient of hearing courteous and affable in discourse and a master of the angry passions which rage with such destructive violence in the breast of a despot Procopius praises his temper to reproach him with calm and deliberate cruelty but in the conspiracies which at tacked his authority and person a more candid judge will approve the justice or admire the clemency of Justinian He excelled in the private virtues of chastity and temperance but the impartial love of beauty would have been less mischie vious than his conjugal tenderness for Theodora and his abstemious diet was re gulated not by the prudence of a philosopher but the superstition of a monk His repasts were short and frugal on solemn fasts he contented himself with water and vegetables and such was his strength as well as fervour that he fre quently passed two days and as many nights without tasting any food The mea sure of his sleep was not less rigorous after the repose of a single hour the body was awakened by the soul and to the astonishment of his chamberlains Justinian walked or studied till the morning light Such restless application prolonged his time for the acquisition of knowledge 3 and the despatch of business and he might seriously deserve the reproach of confounding by minute and preposterous diligence the general order of his administration The emperor professed him self a musician and architect a poet and philosopher a lawyer and theologian and if he failed in the enterprise of reconciling the Christian sects the review of the Roman jurisprudence is a noble monument of his spirit and industry In the go vernment of the empire he was less wise or less successful the age was unfortu nate the people was oppressed and discontented Theodora abused her power a succession of bad ministers disgraced his judgment and Justinian was neither be loved in his life nor regretted at his death The love of fame was deeply im planted in his breast but he condescended to the poor ambition of titles honours and cotemporary praise and while he laboured to fix the admiration he forfeited the esteem and affection of the Romans The design of the African and Italian wars was boldly conceived and executed and his penetration discovered the talents of Belisarius in the camp of Narses in the palace But the name of the emperor is eclipsed by the names of his victorious generals and Belisarius still lives to up braid the envy and ingratitude of his sovereign The partial favour of mankind applauds the genius of a conqueror who leads and directs his subjects in the exer cise of arms The characters of Philip II and of Justinian are distinguished by the cold ambition which delights in war and declines the dangers of the field Yet a colossal statue of bronze represented the emperor on horseback preparing to march against the Persians in the habit and armour of Achilles In the great square before the church of St Sophia this monument was raised on a brass column and a stone pedestal of seven steps and the pillar of Theodosius which weighed se ven thousand four hundred pounds of silver was removed from the same place by the avarice and vanity of Justinian Future princes were more just or indulgent to Ma memory the elder Andronicus in the beginning of the fourteenth century Tbii moral or romantic tale was imported

and which shot its rays into the north Eight years afterwards while the sun was in Capricorn ano ther comet appeared to follow in the Sagittary the size was gradually increasing the head was in the east the tail in the west and it remained visible about forty days The nations who gazed with astonishment expected wars and calamities from their baleful influence and these expectations were abundantly fulfilled The astronomers dissembled their ignorance of the nature of these blazing stars which they affected to represent as the floating meteors of the air and few among them embraced the simple notion of Seneca and the Chaldeans that they are only pla nets of a longer period and more eccentric motion 3 Time and science have justified the conjectures and predictions of the Roman sage the telescope has opened new worlds to the eyes of astronomers 4 and in the narrow space of his tory and fable one and the same comet is already found to have revisited the earth in seven equal revolutions of five hundred and seventy five years The first S which ascends beyond the Christian era one thousand seven hundred and sixty se ven years is coeval with Ogyges the father of Grecian antiquity And this ap pearance explains the tradition which Varro has preserved that under his reign the planet Venus changed her colour size figure and course a prodigy without example either in past or succeeding ages 6 The second visit in the year 1193 is darkly implied in the fable of Electra the seventh of the Pleiads who have been reduced to six since the time of the Trojan war That nymph the wife of Dar danus was unable to support the ruin of her country she abandoned the dances of her sister orbs fled from the zodiac to the north pole and obtained from her dishevelled locks the name of the comet The third period expires in the year 618 a date that exactly agrees with the tremendous comet of the Sibyl and perhaps of Pliny which arose in the west two generations before the reign of Cyrus The fourth apparition forty four years before the birth of Christ is of all others the most splendid and important After the death of Caesar a long haired star was conspi cuous to Rome and to the nations during the games which were exhibited by young Octavian in honour of Venus and his uncle The vulgar opinion that it conveyed to heaven the divine soul of the dictator was cherished and consecrated by the piety of a statesman while his secret superstition referred the comet to the glory of his own times 7 Thefifth visit has already been ascribed to the fifth year of Justinian which coincides with the five hundred and thirty first of the Christian era And it may deserve notice that in this as in the preceding instance the comet was fol lowed though at a longer interval by a remarkable paleness of the sun The sixth return in the year 1106 is recorded by the chronicles of Europe and China and in the first fervour of the Crusades the Christians and the Mahometans might surmise with equal reason that it portended the destruction of the infidels The seventh phenomena of 1680 was presented to the eyes of an enlightened age 8 1 Seein the C P Christiana of Ducange lib i

Natural Questions displays in the theory of comets a philosophic mind Yetshould we not too candidly confound a vague prediction a veniet tempus 8cc with the merit of real dis coveries 4 Astronomers may study Newton and Halley I draw my humble science from the article Comefe in the French Encyclopedic by M d Alembert 5 Wbiston the honest pious visionary Whiston had fancied for the era of Noah s flood two thousand two hundred and forty two years before Christ a prior apparition of the same comet which drowned the earth with its tail 6 A dissertation of Freret Meraoires de 1 Academie des

s muse had so re cently adornei that the comet from its horrid hair skakes pestilence and roar l Its road in the heavens was observed with exquisite skill by Flamstead and Cas sini and the mathematical science of Bernoulli Newton and Halley investi p gated the laws of its revolutions At the eighth period in the year 2255 their calculations may perhaps be verified by the astronomers of some future capital id the Siberian or American wilderness II The near approach of a comet may injure or destroy the globe which we in habit but the changes on its surface have been hitherto produced by the action of volcanoes and earthquakes 2 The nature of the soil may indicate the countries most exposed to these formidable concussions since they are caused by subterra neous fires and such fires are kindled by the union and fermentation of iron and sulphur But their times and effects appear to lie beyond the reach of human cu riosity and the philosopher will discreetly abstain from the prediction of earth quakes till he has counted the drops of water that silently filtrate on the inflam mable mineral and measured the caverns which increase by resistance the explo sion of the imprisoned air Without assigning the cause history will distinguish the periods in which these calamitous events have been rare or trequent and will observe that this fever of the earth raged with uncommon violence during the reign of Justinian 3 Each year is marked by the repetition of earthquakes of such duration that Constantinople has been shaken above forty days of such ex tent that the shock has been communicated to the whole surface of the globe or at least of the Roman empire An impulse or vibratory motion was felt enormous chasms were opened huge and heavy bodies were discharged into the air the sea alternately advanced and retreated beyond its ordinary bounds and a mountain was torn from Libanus 4 and cast into the waves where it protected as a mole the new harbour of Botrys 5 in Phoenicia The stroke that agitates an ant hill may crush the insect myriads in the dust yet truth must extort a confession that man has industriously laboured for his own destruction The institution of great cities which include a nation within the limits of a wall almost realizes the wish of Ca ligula that the Roman people had but one neck Two hundred and fifty thousand pel sons are said to have perished in the earthquake of Antioch whose domestic multitudes were swelled by the conflux of strangers to the festival of the Ascen sion The loss of Bcrytus 6 was of smaller account but of much greater value That city on the coast of Phoenicia was illustrated by the study of the civil law â which opened the surest road to wealth and dignity the schools of Berytus were filled with the rising spirits of the age and many a youth was lost in the earthquake who might have lived to be the scourge or the guardian of his country In these disasters the architect becomes the enemy of mankind The hut of a savage or the tent of an Arab may be thrown down without injury to the inhabitant and the Peruvians had reason to deride the folly of their Spanish conquerors who with so much cost and labour erected their own sepulchres The rich marbles of a patri cian are dashed on his own head a whole people is buried under the ruins of public and private edifices and the conflagration is kindled and propagated by the innumerable fires which are necessary for the subsistence and manufactures of a great city Instead of the mutual sympathy which might comfort and assist the distressed they dreadfully experience the vices and passions which are released from the fear of punishment the tottering houses are pillaged by intrepid avarice ancients in their idolatry Bernoulli Bee his

the image of cteath may sometimes be subservient to the virtue or repentance of individuals an affrighted people is more forcibly moved to expect the end of the world or to deprecate with servile homage the wrath of an avenging Deity  III Ethiopia and Egypt have been stigmatized in every age as the original source and seminary ot the plague l In a damp hot stagnating air this Afri can fever is generated from the putrefaction of animal substances and especially from the swarms of locusts not less destructive to mankind in their death than in their lives The fatal disease which depopulated the earth in the time of Justi nian and his successors 2 first appeared in the neighbourhood of Pelusium be tween the Serbonian bog and the eastern channel of the Nile From thence tracing as it were a double path it spread to the east over Syria Persia and the Indies and penetrated to the west along the coast of Africa and over the conti nent of Europe In the spring of the second year Constantinople during three or four months was visited by the pestilence and Procopius who observed its progress and symptoms with the eyes of a physician 3 has emulated the skill and diligence of Thucydides in the description of the plague of Athens 4 The infection was sometimes announced by the visions of a distempered fancy and the victim despaired as soon as he had heard the menace and felt the stroke of an invisible spectre But the greater number in their beds in the streets in their usual occupation were surprised by a slight fever so slight indeed that neither the pulse nor the colour of the patient gave any signs of the approaching danger The same the next or the succeeding day it was declared by the swelling of the glands particularly those of the groin of the arm pits and under the ear and when those buboes or tumours were opened they were found to contain a coal or black substance of the size of a lentil If they came to a just swelling and sup puration the patient was saved by this kind and natural discharge of the morbid humour But if they continued hard and dry a mortification quickly ensued and the fifth day was commonly the term of his life The fever was often accompa nied with lethargy or delirium the bodies of the sick were covered with black pustules or carbuncles the symptoms of immediate death and in the constitu tions too feeble to produce an eruption the vomiting of blood was followed by a mortification of the bowels To pregnant women the plague was generally mor tal yet one infant was drawn alive from his dead mother and three mothers survived the loss of their infected foetus Youth was the most perilous season and the female sex was less susceptible than the male but every rank and pro fession was attacked with indiscriminate rage and many of those who escaped were deprived of the use of their speech without being secure from a return of the disorder 5 The physicians of Constantinople were zealous and skilful but their art was baffled by the various symptoms and pertinacious vehemence of the disease the same remedies were productive of contrary effects and the event ca priciously disappointed their prognostics of death or recovery The ortVr of fu nerals and the right of sepulchres were confounded those who were left without friends or servants lay unburied in the streets or in their desolate houses and a magistrate was authorized to collect the promiscuous heaps of dead bodies to trans port them by land or water and to inter them in deep pits beyond the precincts of the city Their own danger and the prospects of public distress awakened some remorse in the minds of the most vicious of mankind the confidence of 1 I have read with pleasure Mead s short but elegant treatise concerning pestilential disorders the

I was indebted to Ilr Hunter for an elaborate commentary on this part of Thucydides a quarto of six hundred pages Venet 1603 apud Juntas which was pronounced in St Mark s library by Kabins Paullinus Utinensis a physician and philosopher 5 Thucydides c 51 affirms that the infection could only be once taken but Evagrius who had family experience of the plague observes that some persons who had escaped the first sunk under the second attack and this repetition is confirmed by Fabiits Paullinus p 588 I observe that on this head physicians are di vided and the nature and operation of the disease may not always be similar THE DECLINE AND FALL health again revived their passions and habits but philosophy must disdain the observation of Procopius that the lives of such men were guarded by the peculiar favour of fortune or providence He forgot or perhaps he secretly recollected that the plague had touched the person of Justinian himself but the abstemious diet of the emperor may suggest as in the case of Socrates a more rational and honourable cause for his recovery 1 During his sickness the public consterna tion was expressed in the habits of the citizens and their idleness and despondence occasioned a general scarcity in the capital of the east Contagion is the inseparable symptom of the plague which by mutual respira tion is transfused from the infected persons to the lungs and stomach of those who approach them While philosophers believe and tremble it is singular that the existence of a real danger should have been denied bv a people most prone to vain and imaginary terrors 2 Yet the fellow citizens of Procopius were satisfied by some short and partial experience that the infection could not be gained by the closest conversation 3 and this persuasion might support the assiduity of friends or physicians in the care of the sick whom human prudence would have con demned to solitude and despair But the fatal security like the predestination of the Turks must have aided the progress of the contagion and those salutary pre cautions to which Europe is indebted for her safety were unknown to the go vernment of Justinian No restraints were imposed on the free and frequent in tercourse of the Roman provinces from Persia to France the nations were mingled and infected by wars and emigrations and the pestilential odour which lurks for years in a bale of cotton was imported by the abuse of trade into the most distant regions The mode of its propagation is explained by the remark of Procopius himself that it always spread from the sea coast to the inland country the most sequestered islands and mountains were successively visited the places which had escaped the fury of its passage were alone exposed to the contagion of the ensuing year The winds might diffuse that subtle venom but unless the at mosphere be previously disposed for its reception the plague would soon expire in the cold or temperate climates of the earth Such was the universal corrup tion of the air that the pestilence which burst forth in the fifteenth year of Jus tinian was not checked or alleviated by any difference of the seasons In time its first malignity was abated and dispersed the disease alternately languished and revived but it was not till the end of a calamitous period of fifty two years that mankind recovered their health or the air resumed its pure and salubrious qua lity No facts have been preserved to sustain an account or even a conjecture of the numbers that perished in this extraordinary mortality I only find that during three months five and at length ten thousand persons died each day at Constantinople that many cities of the east were left vacant and that in several districts of Italy the harvest and the vintage withered on the ground The tri ple scourge of war pestilence and famine afflicted the subjects of Justinian and his reign is disgraced by a visible decrease of the human species which has never been repaired in some of the fairest countries of the globe 4 1 It was thui that Socrates had been saved by his temperance in the plague of Athens Aul Gelliut Noc Attie 2 1 Dr Mead accounts for the peculiar salubrity of

The laws of tlie kings â The twelve tables of tine de cemvirs â The laws of the people â The decrees of the senate â The edicts of the magis trates and emperors â Authority of the civilians â Code pandects novels and institutes of Justinian â I Rights of persons â Rights of things â Private injuries and actions IV Crimes and punishments The vain titles of the victories of Justinian are crumbled into dust but the name of the legislator is inscribed on a fair and everlasting monument Under his reign and by his care the civil jurisprudence was digested in the immortal works of the Code the Pandects and the Institutes 1 the public reason of the Romans has been silently or studiously transfused into the domestic institutions of Europe 2 and the laws of Justinian still command the respect or obedience of independent nations Wise or fortunate is the prince who connects his own reputation with the honour and interest of a perpetual order of men The defence of their founder is the first cause which in every age has exercised the zeal and industry of the civi lians They piously commemorate his virtues dissemble or deny his failings and fiercely chastise the guilt or folly of the rebels who presume to sully the majesty of the purple The idolatry of love has provoked as it usually happens the ran cour of opposition the character of Justinian has been exposed to the blind vehemence of flattery and invective and the injustice of a sect the Anti Tri bonians has refused all praise and merit to the prince his ministers and his laws 3 Attached to no party interested only for the truth and candour of histo ry and directed by the most temperate and skilful guides 4 I enter with just dif fidence on the subject of civil law which has exhausted so many learned lives and clothed the walls of such spacious libraries In a single if possible in a short chap ter I shall trace the Roman jurisprudence from Romulus to Justinian 5 appre ciate the labours of that emperor and pause to contemplate the principles of a science so important to the peace and happiness of society The laws of a nation form the most instructive portion of its history and although I have devoted my self to write the annals of a declining monarchy I shall embrace the occasion to breathe the pure and invigorating air of the republic The primitive government of Rome 6 was composed with some political skill of an electiv e king a council of nobles and a general assembly of the people War and religion were administered by the supreme magistrate and he alone proposed the laws which were debated in the senate and finally ratified or rejected by a majority of votes in the thirty curie or parishes of the city Romulus Numa and Servius Tullius are celebrated as the most ancient legislators and each of them claims his peculiar part in the threefold division of jurisprudence 7 The laws 1 The civilians of the darker ages have established an absurd and incomprehensible mode of quotation which is supported by authority and custom In their references to the Code the Pandects and the Insti tutes they mention the number not of the book but only of the law and content themselves

may seem to draw their origin from nature itself are ascribed to the untutored wisdom of Romulus The law of nations and of religious worship which Numa introduced was derived from his nocturnal converse with the nymph Egeria The civil law is attributed to the experience of Servius he balanced the rights and fortunes of the seven classes of citizens and guarded by fifty new regulations the observance of contracts and the punishment of crimes The state which he had inclined to wards a democracy was changed by the last Tarquin into lawless despotism and â when the kingly office was abolished the patricians engrossed the benefits of free dom The royal laws became odious or obsolete the mysterious deposite was si lently preserved by the priests and nobles and at the end of sixty years the citi zens of Rome still complained that they were ruled by the arbitrary sentence of the magistrates Yet the positive institutions of the kings had blended themselves with the public and private manners of the city some fragments of that venerable jurisprudence l were compiled by the diligence of antiquarians 2 and above twenty texts still speak the rudeness of the Pelasgic idiom of the Latins 3 I shall not repeat the well known story of the decemvirs 4 who sullied by their actions the honour of inscribing on brass or wood or ivory the twelve tables of the Roman laws 5 They were dictated by the rigid and jealous spirit of an aristocracy which had yielded with reluctance to the just demands of the people But the substance of the twelve tables was adapted to the state of the city and the Romans had emerged from barbarism since they were capable of studying and embracing the institutions of their more enlightened neighbours A wise Ephe sian was driven by envy from his native country before he could reach the shores of Latium he had observed the various forms of human nature and civil society he imparted his knowledge to the legislators of Rome and a statue was

the legislator of Rhegium and Cata  OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 121 stood without alteration above two hundred years l From a similar motive of national pride both Livy and Dionysius are willing to believe that the deputies of Rome visited Athens under the wise and splendid administration of Pericles and the laws of Solon were transfused into the twelve tables If such an embassy had indeed been received from the barbarians of Hesperia the Roman name would have been familiar to the Greeks before the reign of Alexander 2 and the faint est evidence would have been explored and celebrated by the curiosity of succeed ing times But the Athenian monuments are silent nor will it seem credible that the patricians should undertake a long and perilous navigation to copy the purest model of a democracy In the comparison of the tables of Solon with those of the decemvirs some casual resemblance may be found some rules which nature and reason have revealed to every society some proofs of a common descent from Egypt or Phoenicia 3 But in all the great lines of public and private jurispru dence the legislators of Rome and Athens appear to be strangers or adverse to each other Whatever might be the origin or the merit of the twelve tables 4 they ob tained among the Romans that blind and partial reverence which the lawyers of every country delight to bestow on their municipal institutions The study is re commended by Cicero 5 as equally pleasant and instructive  They amuse the mind by the remembrance of old words and the portrait of ancient manners they inculcate the soundest principles of government and morals and I am not afraid  of civil prudence and our superiority is the more conspicuous if we deign to cast qur eyes on the rude and almost ridiculous jurisprudence of Draco of Solon and of Lycurgus The twelve tables were committed to the memory of the young and the meditation of the old they were transcribed and illustrated with learned diligence they had escaped the flames of the Gauls they subsisted in the age of Jus tinian and their subsequent loss has been imperfectly restored by the labour of modern critics 6 But although these venerable monuments were considered as the rule of right and the fountain of justice 7 they were overwhelmed by the weight and variety of new laws which at the end of five centuries became a grie vance more

integrity of his republic A Locrian who proposed any new law stood forth in the assembly of the people with a cord round his neck and if the law was rejected the innovator was instantly strangled The decemvirs had been named and their tables were approved bv an assem bly of the centuries in which riches preponderated against numbers To the first class of Romans the proprietors of one hundred thousand pounds of copper l ninety eight votes were assigned and only ninety five were left for the six inferior classes distributed according to their substance by the artful policy of Servius But the tribunes soon established a more specious and popular maxim that every citizen has an equal right to enact the laws which lie is bound to obey Instead of the centuries they convened the tribes and the patricians after an important struggle submitted to the decrees of an assembly in which their votes were con founded with those of the meanest plebeians Yet as long as the tribes succes sively passed over narrow bridges 2 and gave their voices aloud the conduct of each citizen was exposed to the eyes and ears of his friends and countrymen The insolvent debtor consulted the wishes of his creditor the client would have blushed to oppose the views of his patron the general was followed by his vete rans and the aspect of the grave magistrate was a living lesson to the multitude A new method of secret ballot abolished the influence of fear and shame of ho nour and interest and the abuse of freedom accelerated the progress of anarchy and despotism 3 The Romans had aspired to be equal they were levelled by the equality of servitude and the dictates of Augustus were patiently ratified by the formal consent of the tribes of centuries Once and once only he experi enced a sincere and strenuous opposition His subjects had resigned all political liberty they defended the freedom of domestic life A law which enforced the obligation and strengthened the bonds of marriage was clamorously rejected Propertius in the arms of Delia applauded the victory of licentious love and the project of reform was suspended till a new and more tractable generation had arisen in the world 4 Such an example was not necessary to instruct a prudent usurper of the mischief of popular assemblies and their abolition which Au gustus had silently prepared was accomplished without resistance and almost without notice on the accession of his successor 5 Sixty thousand plebeian leg islators whom numbers made formidable and poverty secure were supplanted by six hundred senators who held their honours their fortunes and their lives by the clemency of the emperor The loss of executive power was alleviated by the gift of legislative authority and Ulpian might assert after the practice of two hundred years that the decrees of the senate obtained the force and validity of laws In the times of freedom the resolves of the people had often been dittated by the passion or error of moment the Cornelian Pompeian and Julian laws were adapted by a single hand to the prevailing disorders but the senate under the reign of the Cxsars was composed of magistrates and lawyers and in ques tions of private jurisprudence the integrity of their judgment was seldom pervert ed by fear or interest 6 The silence or ambiguity of the laws was supplied by the occasional edicts of those magistrates who were invested with the honours of the state 7 This an fi Dionysim with Arbuthuot and most of the moderns except Eisentchmidt de Ponderibus e p 137â 340 represent the one hundred thousand asses by ten thousand Attic drachmae or somewhat more than three hundred pounds sterling But their calculation can apply only to the latter times when the as was dimi nished to one twenty fourih of its ancient weight nor can I believe that in the first ages however destitute of the precious metals a single ounce of silver could hare been exchanged for seventy pounds of copper or brass A more simple and rational method is to value the eopper itself according to the present rate and after com paring the mint and the market price the Roman and avoirdupois weight the primitive as or Roman pound of copper may be appreciated at one English shilling and the one hundred thousand asses of the first class amounted to five thousand pounds sterling It will appear from the same reckoning that an ox was

crent prerogative of the Roman kings was transferred in their respective offices to the consuls and dictators the censors and pretors and a similar right was as sumed by the tribunes of the people the ediles and proconsuls At Rome and in the provinces the duties of the subject and the intentions of the governor were proclaimed and the civil jurisprudence was reformed by the annual edicts of the supreme judge the pretor of the city As soon as he ascended his tribunal he an nounced by the voice of the crier and afterwards inscribed on a white wall the rules which he proposed to follow in the decision of doubtful cases and the relief which his equity would afford from the precise rigour of ancient statutes A prin ciple of discretion more congenial to monarchy was introduced into the republic the art of respecting the name and eluding the efficacy of the laws was improved by successive pretors subtleties and fictions were invented to defeat the plainest meaning of the decemvirs and where the end was salutary the means were fre frequently absurd The secret or probable wish of the dead was suffered to pre vail over the order of succession and the forms of testaments and the claimant who was excluded from the character of heir accepted with equal pleasure from an indulgent pretor the possession of the goods of his late kinsman and benefactor In the redress of private wrongs compensations and fines were substituted to the obsolete rigour of the twelve tables time and space were annihilated by fanciful suppositions and the plea of youth or fraud or violence annulled the obligation or excused the performance of an inconvenient contract A jurisdiction thus vague and arbitrary was exposed to the most dangerous abuse the substance as well as the form of justice were often sacrificed to the prejudices of virtue the bias of laudable affection and the grosser seductions of interest or resentment But the errors or vices of each pretor expired with his annual office such maxims alone as had been approved by reason and practice were copied by succeeding judges the rule of proceeding was defined by the solution of new cases and the temptations of injustice were removed by the Cornelian law which compelled the pretor of the year to adhere to the letter and spirit of his first proclamation 1 It was re served for the curiosity and learning of Hadrian to accomplish the design which he had conceived by the genius of Caesar and the pretorship of Salvius Julian an eminent lawyer was immortalized by the composition of the perpetual edict This well digested code was ratified by the emperor and the senate the long di vorce of law and equity was at length reconciled and instead of the twelve ta bles the perpetual edict was fixed as the invariable standard of civil jurispru dence  2 From Augustus to Trajan the modern Caisars were content to promulgate their edicts in the various characters of a Roman magistrate and in the decrees of the senate the efiistles and orations of the prince were respectfully inserted Hadri an 3 appears to have been the first who assumed without disguise the plenitude of legislative power And this innovation so agreeable to his active mind was countenanced by the patience of the times and his long absence from the seat of government The same policy was embraced by succeeding monarchs and ac cording to the harsh metaphor of Tertullian  the gloomy and intricate forest of ancient laws was cleared away by the axe of royal mandates and constitutions 4 During four centuries from Hadrian to Justinian the public and private jurispru dence was moulded by the will of the sovereign and few institutions either human or divine were permitted to stand on their former basis The origin of imperial legislation was concealed by the darkness of ages and the terrors of armed des potism and a double fiction was propagated by the servilitv or perhaps the igno rance of the civilians who basked in the sunshine of the Roman and Byzantine courts 1 To the prayer of the ancient C sars the people or the senate had stitulei flib i tit ii No 7 and more loosely explained in the Greek paraphrase of Theophilos p 33â 38

personal exemption from the obligation and penalty of parti ticular statutes and each indulgence was an act of jurisdiction exercised by the re public over the first of her citizens His humble privilege was at length transformed into the prerogative of a tyrant and the Latin expression of released from the lait 8 was supposed to exalt the emperor above all human restraints and to leave his conscience and reason as the sacred measure of his conduct 2 A simi lar dependence was implied in the decrees of the senate which in every reign defined the titles and powers of an elective magistrate But it was not before the ideas and even the language of the Romans had been corrupted that a royal law 2 and an irrevocable gift of the people were created by the fancy of Ulpian or more probably of Tribonian himself 3 and the origin of imperial power though false in fact and slavish in its consequence was supported on a principle of free dom and justice  The pleasure of the emperor has the vigour and effect of law since the Roman people by the roy il law have transferred to their prince the full extent of their own power and sovereignly 4 The will of a single man of a child perhaps was allowed to prevail over the wisdom of ages and the inclinations of millions and the degenerate Greeks were proud to declare that in his hands alone the arbitrary exercise of legislation could be safely deposited  What inte rest or passion exclaims Theophilus in the court of Justinian can reach the calm and sublime elevation of the monarch He is already master of the lives and fortunes of his subjects and those who have incurred his displeasure are already numbered with the dead 5 Disdaining the language of flattery the historian may confess that in questions of private jurisprudence the absolute sovereign of a great empire can seldom be influenced by any personal considerations Virtue or even reason will suggest to his impartial mind that he is the guardian of peace and equity and that the interest of society is inseparably connected with his own Under the weakest and most vicious reign the seat of justice was filled by the wis dom and integrity of Papinian and Ulpian 6 and the purest materials of the Code and Pandects are inscribed with the names of Caracalla and his ministers 7 The tyrant of Rome was sometimes the benefactor of the provinces A dagger termi nated the crimes of Domitian but the prudence of Nerva confirmed his acts which in the joy of their deliverance had been rescinded by an indignant senate 8 Vet in the rescri ils 9 replies to the consultations of the magistrates the wisest of princes might be deceived by a partial exposition of the case And this abuse which placed their hasty decisions on the same level with mature and deliberate acts of

actions of law was the inheri tance of the pontiffs and the patricians Like the Chaldean astrologers they an nounced to their clients the days of business and repose these important trifles were interwoven with the religion of Numa and after the publication of the twelve tables the Roman people were still enslaved by the ignorance of judicial proceedings The treachery of some plebeian officers at length revealed the pro fitable mystery in a more enlightened age the legal actions were derided and ob served and the same antiquity which sanctified the practice obliterated the use and meaning of this primitive language 5 A more liberal art was cultivated however by the sages of Rome who in a stricter sense may be considered as the authors of the civil law The alteration of the idiom and manners of the Romans rendered the style of the twelve tables less familiar to each rising generation and the doubtful passages were imperfectly explained by the study of legal antiquarians To define the ambiguities to cir cumscribe the latitude to apply the principles to extend the consequences to reconcile the real or apparent contradictions was a much nobler and more im portant task and the province of legislation was silently invaded by the expoun ders of ancient statutes Their subtle interpretations concurred with the equity of the pretor to reform the tyranny of the darker

three periods almost equal in duration and distinguished from each other by the mode of instruction and the character of civilians 1 Pride and ig norance contributed during the first period to confine within narrow limits the science of the Roman law On the public days of market or assembly the masters of the art were seen walking in the forum ready to impart the needful advice to the meanest of their fellow citizens from whose votes on a future occasion they might solicit a grateful return As their years and honours increased they seat ed themselves at home on a chair or throne to expect with patient gravity the visits of their clients who at the dawn of day from the town and country began to thunder at their door The duties of social life and the incidents of judicial proceeding were the ordinary subject of these consultations and the verbal or written opinion of the jurisconsults was framed according to the rules of prudence and law The youths of their own order and family were permitted to listen their children enjoyed the benefit of more private lessons and the Mucian race was long renowned for the hereditary knowledge of the civil law The second Seriod the learned and splendid age of jurisprudence may be extended from the irth of Cicero to the reign of Severus Alexander A system was formed schools were instituted books were composed and both the living and the dead became subservient to the instruction of the student The tripartite of JElius Pstus sur named Catus or the Cunning was preserved as the oldest work of jurisprudence Cato the censor derived some additional fame from his legal studies and those of his son the kindred appellation of Mucius Scscvola was illustrated by three sages of the law but the perfection of the science was ascribed to Servius Sulpicius their disciple and the friend of Tully and the long succession which shone with equal lustre under the republic and under the Ciesars is finally closed by the re spectable characters of Papinian of Paul and of Ulpian Their names and the various titles of their productions have been minutely preserved and the exam ple of Labeo may suggest some idea of their diligence and fecundity That emi nent lawyer of the Augustan age divided the year between the city and country between business and composition and four hundred books are enumerated as the fruit of his retirement Of the collections of his rival Capito the two hundred and fifty ninth book is expressly quoted and few teachers could deliver their opinions in less than a century of volumes In the third period between the reigns of Alexander and Justinian the oracles of jurisprudence were almost mute The measure of curiosity had been filled the throne was occupied by tyrants and barbarians the active spirits were diverted by religious disputes and the pro fessors of Rome Constantinople and Berytus were humbly content to repeat the lessons of their more enlightened predecessors From the slow advances and rapid decay of these legal studies it may be inferred that they require a state of peace and refinement From the multitude of voluminous civilians who fill the intermediate space it is evident that such studies may be pursued and such works mav be performed with a common share of judgment experience and in dustry The genius of Cicero and Virgil was more sensibly felt as each revolving age had been found incapable of producing a similar or a second but the most eminent teachers of the law were assured of leaving disciples equal or superior to themselves in merit and reputation The jurisprudence which had been grossly adapted to the wants of the first Ro mans was polished and improved in the seventh century of the city by the alliance of Grecian philosophy The Scxvolas had been taught by use and experience but Servius Sulpicius was the first civilian who established his art on a certain and ge neral theory 2 For the discernment of truth and falsehood he applied as an 1 The series of the

particular cases to ge neral principles and diffused over the shapeless mass the light of order and elo quence Cicero his cotemporary and friend declined the reputation of a pro fessed lawyer but the jurisprudence of his country was adorned by his incomparable genius which converts into gold every object that it touches After the example of Plato he composed a republic and for the use of his republic a treatise of laws in which he labours to deduce from a celestial origin the wisdom and jus tice of the Roman constitution The whole universe according to his sublime hypothesis forms one immense commonwealth gods and men who participate of the same essence are members of the same community reason prescribes the law of nature and nations and all positive institutions however modified by accident or custom are drawn from the rule of right which the Deity has in scribed on every virtuous mind From these philosophical mysteries he mildly excludes the sceptics who refuse to believe and the Epicureans who are unwill ing to act The latter disdain the care of the republic he advises them to slum ber in their shady gardens But he humbly entreats that the new academy would be silent since her bold objections would too soon destroy the fair and well ordered structure of his lofty system 1 Plato Aristotle and Zeno he represents as the only teachers who arm and instruct a citizen for the duties of social life Of these the armour of the stoics 2 was found to be of the firmest temper and it was chiefly worn both for use and ornament in the schools of jurisprudence From the portico the Roman civilians learned to live to reason and to die but they imbibed in some degree the prejudices of the sect the love of paradox the perti nacious habits of dispute and a minute attachment to words and verbal distinc tions The superiority of form to matter was introduced to ascertain the right of property and the equality of crimes is countenanced by an opinion of Treba tius 3 that he who touches the ear touches the whole body and that he who steals from a heap of corn or a hogshead of wine is guilty of the entire theft 4 Arms eloquence and the study of the civil law promoted a citizen to the ho nours of the Roman state and the three professions were sometimes more conspi cuous by their union in the same character In the composition of the jedict a learned pretor gave a sanction and preference to his private sentiments the opi nion of a censor or a consul was entertained with respect and a doubtful inter pretation of the laws might be supported by the virtues or triumphs of the ci vilian The patrician arts were long protected by the veil of mystery and in more enlightened times the freedom of inquiry established the general principles of jurisprudence Subtle and intricate cases were elucidated by the disputes of the forum rules axioms and definitions 5 were admitted as the genuine dic tates of reason and the consent of the legal professors was interwoven into the practice of the tribunals But these interpreters could neither enact nor execute the laws of the republic and the judges might disregard the authority of Scxvo las themselves which was often overthrown by the eloquence or sophistry of ait ingenious pleader 6 Augustus and Tiberius were the first to adopt as a useful engine the science of the civilians and their servile labours accommodated the old system to the spirit and views of despotism Under the fair pretence of se curing the dignity of the art the privilege of subscribing legal and valid opinions was confined to the sages of senatorian or equestrian rank who had been previ ously approved by the judgment of the prince and this monopoly prevailed till Hadrian restored the freedom of the profession to every citizen

contempt of that â favour and his stern though harmless opposition to the tyrant of Rome Their legal studies were influenced by the various colours of their temper and princi ples Labeo was attached to the form of the old republic his rival embraced the more profitable substance of the rising monarchy But the disposition of a cour tier is tame and submissive and Capito seldom presumed to deviate from the sen timents or at least from the words of his predecessors while the bold republican pursued his independent ideas without fear of paradox or innovations The free dom of Labeo was enslaved however by the rigour of his own conclusions and he decided according to the letter of the law the same questions which his indul gent competitor resolved with a latitude of equity more suitable to the common sense and feelings of mankind If a fair exchange had been substituted to the payment of money Capito still considered the transaction as a legal sale 4 and he consulted nature for the age of puberty without confining his definition to the precise period of twelve or fourteen years 5 This opposition of sentiments was propagated in the writings and lessons of the two founders the schools of Capito and Labeo maintained their inveterate conflict from the age of Augustus to that of Hadrian 6 and the two sects derived their appellations from Sabinus and Pro culus their most celebrated teachers The names of Cassians and Pegasians were likewise applied to the same parties but by a strange reverse the popular cause was in the hands of Pegasus 7 a timid slave of Domitian while the fa vourite of the Cxsars was represented by Cassius 8 who gloried in his descent from the patriot assassin By the perpetual edict the controversies of the sects were in a great measure determined For that important work the emperor Hadrian preferred the chief of the Sabinians the friends of monarchy prevailed but the moderation of Salvius Julian insensibly reconciled the victors and the van quished Like the cotemporary philosophers the lawyers of the age of the An tonines disclaimed the authority of a master and adopted from every system the most probable doctrines 9 But their writings

edict of the younger Theodosius excused liim from the labour of comparing and weighing their arguments Five civilians Ca ius Papinian Paul Ulpian and Modestinus were established as the oracles of jurisprudence a majority was decisive but if their opinions were equally divided a casting vote was ascribed to the superior wisdom of Papinian 1 When Justinian ascended the throne the reformation of the Roman jurispru dence was an arduous but indispensable task In the space of ten centuries the infinite variety of laws and equal opinions had filled many thousand volumes which no fortune could purchase and no capacity could digest Books could not easily be found and the judges poor in the midst of riches were reduced to the exercise of their illiterate discretion The subjects of the Greek provinces were ignorant of the language that disposed of their lives and properties and the barbarous dia lect of the Latins was imperfectly studied in the academies of Berytus and Con stantinople As an Illyrian soldier that idiom was familiar to the infancy of Jus tinian his youth had been instructed by the lessons of jurisprudence and his im perial choice selected the most learned civilians of the east to labour with their sovereign in the work of reformation 2 The theory of professors was assisted by the practice of advocates and the experience of magistrates and the whole un dertaking was animated by the spirit of Tribonian  This extraordinary man the object of so much praise and censure was a native of Side in Pamphylia and his genius like that of Bacon embraced as his own all the business and know ledge of the age Tribonian composed both in prose and verse on a strange di versity of curious and abstruse subjects 4 â a double panegyric of Justinian and the life of the philosopher Theodotus the nature of happiness and the duties of government Homer s catalogue and the four and twenty sorts of metre the astro nomical canon of Ptolemy the changes of the months the houses of the planets and the harmonic system of the world To the literature of Greece he added the use of the Latin tongue the Roman civilians were deposited in his library and in his mind and he most assiduously cultivated those arts which opened the road of wealth and preferment From the bar of the pretorian prefects he raised him self to the honours of questor of consul and of master of the offices the council of Justinian listened to his eloquence and wisdom and envy was mitigated by the gentleness and affability of his manners The reproaches of impiety and avarice have stained the virtues or the reputation of Tribonian In a bigoted and persecu ting court the principal minister was accused of a secret aversion to the Christian faith and was supposed to entertain the sentiments of an atlieist and a pagan which have been imputed inconsistently enough to the last philosophers of Greece His avarice was more clearly proved and more sensibly felt If he were swayed by gifts in the administration of justice the example of Bacon will again occur nor can the merit of Tribonian atone for his baseness if he degraded the sanctity of his profession and if laws were every day enacted modified or re pealed for the base consideration of his private emolument In the sedition of Constantinople his removal was granted to the clamours perhaps to the just in dignation of the people but the questor was speedily restored and till the hour of his death he possessed above twenty years the favour and confidence of the em peror His passive and dutiful submission has been honoured with the praise of Justinian himself whose vanity was incapable of discerning how often that sub mission degenerated into the grossest adulation Tribonian adored the virtues of his gracious master the earth

the mansions of celestial glory 1 If Caesar had achieved the reformation of the Roman law his creative genius enlightened by reflection and study would have given to the world a pure and original system of jurisprudence Whatever flattery might suggest the emperor of the east was afraid to establish his private judgment as the standard of equity in the possession of legislative power he borrowed the aid of time and opinion and his laborious compilations are guarded by the sages and legislators of past times Instead of a statue cast in a simple mould by the hand of an artist the works of Justinian represent a tesselated pavement of antique and costly but too often of in coherent fragments In the first year of his reign he directed the faithful Tribo nian and nine learned associates to revise the ordinances of his predecessors as they were contained since the time of Hadrian in the Gregorian Hermogenian and Theodosian codes to purge the errors and contradictions to retrench what ever was obsolete or superfluous and to select the wise and salutary laws best adapted to the practice of the tribunals and the use of his subjects The work was accomplished in fourteen months and the twelve books or tables which the new decemvirs produced might be designed to imitate the labours of their Roman predecessors The new code of Justinian was honoured with his name and con firmed by his royal signature authentic transcripts were multiplied by the pens of notaries and scribes they were transmitted to the magistrates of the European the Asiatic and afterwards the African provinces and the law of the empire was proclaimed on solemn festivals at the doors of churches A more arduous opera tion was still behind to extract the spirit of jurisprudence from the decisions and conjectures the questions and disputes of the Roman civilians Seventeen law yers with Tribonian at their head were appointed by the emperor to exercise an absolute jurisdiction over the works of their predecessors If they had obeyed his commands in ten years Justinian would have been satisfied with their diligence and their rapid composition of the digest or fandects 2 in three years will deserve praise or censure according to the merit of the execution From the li brary of Tribonian they chose forty the most eminent civilians of former times 3 two thousand treatises were comprised in an abridgment of fifty books and it has been carefully recorded that three millions of lines or sentences 4 were reduced in this abstract to the moderate number of one hundred and fifty thousand The edition of this great work was delayed a month after that of the institutes and it seemed reasonable that the elements should precede the digest of the Roman law As soon as the emperor had approved their labours he ratified by his le gislative power the speculations of these private citizens i their commentaries on the twelve tables the perpetual edict the laws of the people and the decrees of the senate succeeded to the authority of the text and tne text was abandoned as a useless though venerable relic of antiquity The Cade the Pandects and the Institutes were declared to be the legitimate system of civil jurisprudence they alone were admitted in the tribunals and they alone were taught in the academies of Rome Constantinople and Berytus Justinian addressed to the senate and

original composition we can â only require at his hands method choice and fidelity the humble though indis pensable virtues of a compiler Among the various combinations of ideas St is difficult to assign any reasonable preference but as the order of Justinian is differ ent in his three works it is possible that all may be wrong and it is certain that two cannot be right In the selection of ancient laws he seems to have viewed his predecessors with jealousy and with equal regard the series could not ascend above the reign of Hadrian and the narrow distinction of paganism and Christi anity introduced by the superstition of Theodosius had been abolished by the consent of mankind But the jurisprudence of the Pandects is circumscribed with in a period of a hundred years from the perpetual edict to the death of Severus Alexander the civilians who lived under the first Cxsars are seldom permitted to speak and only three names can be attributed to the age of the republic The favourite of Justinian it has been fiercely urged was fearful of encountering the light of freedom and the gravity cf the Roman sages Tribonian condemned to oblivion the genuine and native wisdom of Cato the Scssvolas and Sulpicius while he invoked spirits more congenial to his own the Syrians Greeks and Africans who flocked to the imperial court to study Latin as a foreign tongue and jurispru dence as a lucrative profession But the ministers of Justinian l were instructed to labour not for the curiosity of antiquarians but for the immediate benefit of his subjects It was their duty to select the useful and practicable parts of the Ro man law and the writings of the old republicans however curious or excellent were no longer suited to the new system of manners religion and government Perhaps if the preceptors and friends of Cicero were still alive our candour would acknowledge that except in purity of language 2 their intrinsic merit was ex celled by the school of Papinian and Ulpian Thjp science of the laws is the slow growth of time and experience and the advantage both of method and materials is naturally assumed by the most recent authors The civilians of the reign of the Antoniiies had studied the works of their predecessors their philosophic spirit had mitigated the rigour of antiquity simplified the forms of proceeding and emerged from the jealousy and prejudice of the rival sects The choice of the authorities that compose the Pandects depended on the judgment of Tribonian but the power of his sovereign could not absolve him from the sacred obligations of truth and fi delity As the legislator of the empire Justinian might repeal the acts of the An tonines or condemn as seditious the free principles which were maintained by the last of the Roman lawyers 3 But the existence of past facts is placed be yond the reach of despotism and the emperor was guilty of fraud and forgery when he corrupted the integrity of their text inscribed with their venerable names the words and ideas of his servile reign 4 and suppressed by the hand of power the pure and authentic copies of their sentiments The changes and interpola tions of Tribonian and his colleagues are excused by the pretence of uniformity  but their cares have been insufficient and the antinomies or contradictions of the Code and Pandects still exercise the patience and subtlety of modern civilians 5 A rumour devoid of evidence has been propagated by the enemies of Justinian that the jurisprudence of ancient Rome was reduced to ashes by the author of the Pandects from the vain persuasion that it was now either false or superfluous Without usurping an office so invidious the emperor might safely commit to igno rance and time the accomplishment of this

stability could be expected for the dull and barren works of an obsolete science The books of jurisprudence were interesting to few and entertaining to none their value was connected with pre sent use and they sunk for ever as soon as that use was superseded by the innova tions of fashion superior merit or public authority In the age of peace and learn ing between Cicero and the last of the Antonines many losses had been already sustained and some luminaries of the school or forum were known only to the curious by tradition and report Three hundred and sixty years of disorder and decay accelerated the progress of oblivion and it may fairly be presumed that of the writings which Justinian is accused of neglecting many were no longer to be found in the libraries of the east 2 The copies of Papinian or Ulpian which the  reformer had proscribed were deemed unworthy of future notice the twelve ta bles and pretorian edict insensibly vanished and the monuments of ancient Rome were

Barto lus of Cujacius should blush for their accumulated guilt unless they dare to dis pute his right of binding the authority of his successors and the native freedom of the mind But the emperor was

intricate points of jurisprudence Every year or according to Procopius each day of his long reign was marked by some legal innovation Many of his acts were rescinded by himself many were rejected by his successors many have been obliterated by time but the number of sixteen edicts and one hundred and sixty eight novels 1 has been admitted into the authentic body of the civil jurisprudence In the opinion of a philosopher superior to the pre judices of his profession these incessant and for the most part trifling altera tions can be only explained by the venal spirit of a prince who sold without shame his judgments and his laws 2 The charge of the secret historian is indeed explicit and vehement but the sole instance which he produces may be ascribed to the devotion as well as to the avarice of Justinia A wealthy bigot had bequeathed his inheritance to the church of Emesa and its value was enhanced by the dexterity of an artist who subscribed confessions of debt and promises of pay ment with the names of the richest Syrians They pleaded the established pre scription of thirty or forty years but their defence was overruled by a retrospec tive edict which extended the claims of the church to the term of a century an edict so pregnant with injustice and disorder that after serving this occasional pur pose it was prudently abolished in the same reign 3 If candour will acquit the emperor himself and transfer the corruption to his wife and favourites the suspi cion of so foul a vice must still degrade the majesty of his laws and the advocates of Justinian may acknowledge that such levity whatsoever be the motive is un worthy of a legislator and a man Monarchs seldom condescend to become the preceptors of their subjects and some praise is due to Justinian by whose command an ample system was reduced to a short and elementary treatise Among the various institutes of the Roman law 4 those of Caius 5 were the most popular in the east and west and their use may be considered as an evidence of their merit They were selected by the imperial delegates Tribonian Theophilus and Dorotheus and the freedom and purity of the Antonines was incrusted with the coarser materials of a degenerate age The same volume which introduced the youth of Rome Constantinople and Berytus to the gradual study of the Code and Pandects is still precious to the historian the philosopher and the magistrate The institutes of Justinian are divided into four books they proceed with no contemptible method from I Per sons to II Things and from things to III Actions and the

wealthy plebeians 134 THE DECLINE AND FALL cline of the Roman empire the proud distinctions of the republic were gradually abolished and the reason or instinct of Justinian completed the simple form of an absolute monarchy The emperor could not eradicate the popular reverence which always waits on the possession of hereditary wealth or the memory of fa mous ancestors He delighted to honour with titles and emoluments his gene rals magistrates and senators and his precarious indulgence communicated some rays of their glory to the persons of their wives and children But in the eye of the law all Roman citizens were equal and all subjects of the empire were citi zens of Rome That inestimable character was degraded to an obsolete and emp ty name The voice of a Roman could no longer enact his laws or create the annual ministers of his power his constitutional rights might have checked the arbitrary will of a master and the bold adventurer from Germany or Arabia was admitted with equal favour to the civil and military command which the citizen alone had been once entitled to assume over the conquests of his fathers The first Cscsars had scrupulously guarded the distinction of ingenuous and servile birth which was decided by the condition of the mother and the candour of the laws was satisfied if her freedom could be ascertained during a single moment be tween conception and the delivery The slaves who were liberated by a generous master immediately entered into the middle class bf libertines or freedmen but they could never be enfranchised from the duties of obedience and gratitude whatever were the fruits of their industry their patron and his family inherited the third part or even the whole of their fortune if they died without children and without a testament Justinian respected the rights of patrons but his indul gence removed the badge of disgrace from the two inferior orders of freedmen whoever ceased to be a slave obtained without reserve or delay the station of a citizen and at length the dignity of an ingenuous birth which nature had refused was created or supposed by the omnipotence of the emperor Whatever re straints of age or forms or numbers had been formerly introduced to check the abuse of manumissions and the too rapid increase of vile and indigent Romans he finally abolished and the spirit of his laws promoted the extinction of domes tic servitude Yet the eastern provinces were filled in the time of Justinian with multitudes of slaves either born or purchased for the use of their masters and the price from ten to seventy pieces of gold was determined by their age their strength and their education 1 But the hardships of this dependant state were continually diminished by the influence of government and religion and the pride of a subject was no longer elated by his absolute dominion over the life and hap piness of his bondsman 2 The law of nature instructs most animals to cherish and educate their infant progeny The law of reason inculcates to the human species the returns of that â piety But the exclusive absolute and perpetual dominion of the father over his children is peculiar to the Roman jurisprudence 3 and seems to be coeval with the foundation of the city 4 The paternal power was instituted or confirmed by Romulus himself and after the practice of three centuries it was inscribed on the fourth table of the decemvirs In the forum the senate or the camp the adult son of a Roman citizen enjoyed the public and private rights of a fierson in his father s house he was a mere thing confounded by the laws with the move ables the cattle and the slaves whom the capricious master might alienate or de stroy without being responsible to any earthly tribunal The hand which be stowed the daily sustenance might resume the voluntary gift and whatever was acquired by the labour or fortune of the son was immediately lost in the property 1 If the option of a slave was bequeathed to several legatees they drew lots and the losers were entitled to their share of his value ten pieces of gold for a common servant or maid under ten years if above that are twenty if they knew a trade

trespass it was in his own option to compensate the damage or resign to the injured party the ob noxious animal At the call of indigence or avarice the master of a family could dispose of his children or his slaves But the condition of the slave was far more advantageous since he regained by the first manumission his alienated freedom the son was again restored to his unnatural father he might be condemned to ser vitude a second and third time and it was not till after the third sale and delive rance 2 that he was enfranchised from the domestic power which had been so repeatedly abused According to his discretion a father might chastise the real or imaginary faults of his children by stripes by imprisonment by exile by send ing them to the country to work in chains among the meanest of his servants The majesty of a parent was armed with the power of life and death 3 and the examples of such bloody executions which were sometimes praised and never punished may be traced in the annals of Rome beyond the times of Pompey and Augustus Neither age nor rank nor the consular office nor the honours of a tri umph could exempt the most illustrious citizen from the bonds of filial subjec tion 4 his own descendants were included in the family of their common ances tor and the claims of adoption were not less sacred or less rigorous than those of nature Without fear though not without danger of abuse the Roman legisla tors had reposed an unbounded confidence in the sentiments of paternal love and the oppression was tempered by the assurance that each generation must succeed in its turn to the awful dignity of parent and master The first limitation of paternal power is ascribed to the justice and humanity of Numa and the maid who with his father s consent had espoused a free man was protected from the disgrace of becoming the wife of a slave In the first ages when the city was pressed and often famished by her Latin and Tus can neighbours the sale of children might be a frequent practice but as a Roman could not legally purchase the liberty of his fellow citizen the market must gra dually fail and the trade would be destroyed by the conquests of the republic An imperfect right of property was at length communicated to sons and the three fold distinction of firofectious adventitious and firqfessional was ascertained by the jurisprudence of the Code and Pandects 5 Of all that proceeded from the father he imparted only the use and reserved the absolute dominion yet if his goods were sold the filial portion was excepted by a favourable interpretation from the demands of the creditors In whatever accrued by marriage gift or collateral succession the property was secured to the son but the father unless he had been specially excluded enjoyed the usufruct during his life As a just and prudent re ward of military virtue the spoils of the enemy were acquired possessed and be queathed by the soldier alone and the fair analogy was extended to the emoluments of any liberal profession the salary of public service and the sacred liberality of the emperor or the empress The life of a citizen was less exposed than his for tune to the abuse of paternal power Yet his life might be adverse to the interest or passions of an unworthy father the same crimes that flowed from the corrup tion were more sensibly felt by the humanity of the Augustan age and the cruel Erixo who whipt his son till he expired was saved by the emperor from the just fury of the multitude 6 The Roman father from the license of servile dominion was reduced to the

an accuser and the magistrates were enjoined by Severus Alexander to hear his complaints and execute his sentence He could no longer take the life of a son without incurring the guilt and punishment of murder and the pains of parricide from which he had been exempted by the Pompeian law were finally inflicted by the justice of Constantine 2 The same protection was due to every period of ex istence and reason must applaud the humanity of Paulus for imputing the crime of murder to the father who strangles or starves or abandons his new born in fant or exposes him in a public place to find the mercy which he himself had de nied But the exposition of children was the prevailing and stubborn vice of anti quity it was sometimes practised often permitted almost always practised with impunity by the nations who n ver entertained the Roman ideas of paternal power and the dramatic poets who appeal to the human heart represent with indiffer ence a popular custom which was palliated by the motives ot economy and com passion 3 If the father could subdue his own feelings he might escape though not the censure at least the chastisement of the laws and the Roman empire was stained with the blood of infants till such murders were included by Valentinian and his colleagues in the letter and spirit of the Cornelian law 1 he lessons of jurisprudence 4 and Christianity had been insufficient to eradicate this inhuman practice till their gentle influence was fortified by the terrors of capital punish ment Experience has proved that savages are the tyrants of the female sex and that the condition of women is usually softened by the refinements of social life In the hope of a robust progeny Lycurgus had delayed the season of marriage it was fixed by Numa at the tender age of twelve years that the Roman husband might educate to his will a pure and obedient virgin 6 According to the custom of an tiquity he bought his bride of her parents and she fulfilled the coemption by pur chasing with three pieces of copper a just introduction to his house and household deities A sacrifice of fruits was offered by the pontiffs in the presence of ten wit nesses the contracting parties were seated on the same sheepskin they tasted a salt cake offar or rice and this confareation 7 which denoted the ancient food of Italy served a9 an emblem of their mystic union of mind and body But this union on the side of the woman was rigorous and unequal and she renounced the name and worship of her father s house to embrace a new servitude decorated only by the title of adoption A

master who was in vested with the plenitude of paternal power By his judgment or caprice her be haviour was approved or censured or chastised he exercised the jurisdiction of life and death and it was

moveables by the use and possession of an entire rear The inclination of the Roman husband discharged or withheld the conjugal debt so scrupulously exacted by the Athenian and Jewish laws l but as polygamy was unknown he could never admit to his bed a fairer or more favoured partner After the Punic triumphs the matrons of Rome aspired to the common benefits of a free and opulent republic their wishes were gratified by the indulgence of fa thers and lovers and their ambition was unsuccessfully resisted by the gravity of Cato the censor 2 They declined the solemnities of the old nuptials defeated the annual prescription by an absence of three days and without losing their name or independence subscribed the liberal and definite terms of a marriage contract Of their private fortunes they communicated the use and secured the property the estates of a wife could neither be alienated nor mortgaged by a prodigal hus band their mutual gifts were prohibited by the jealousy of the laws ar d the mis conduct of either party might afford under another name a future subject for an action of theft To this loose and voluntary compact religious and civil rights were no longer essential and between persons or a similar rank the apparent community of life was allowed as sufficient evidence of their nuptials The dig nity of marriage was restored by the Christians who derived all spiritual grace from the prayers of the faithful and the benediction of the priest or bishop The origin validity and duties of the holy institution were regulated by the tradition of the synagogue the precepts of the gospel and the canons of general or pro vincial synods 3 and the conscience of the Christians was awed by the decrees and censures of their ecclesiastical rulers Yet the magistrates of Justinian were not subject to the authority of the church the emperor consulted the unbelieving civilians of antiquity and the choice of matrimonial laws in the Codes and Pan dects is directed by the earthly motives of justice policy and the natural free dom of both sexes 4 Besides the agreement of the parties the essence of every rational contract the Roman marriage required the previous approbation of the parents A father might be forced by some recent laws to supply the wants of a mature daughter but even his insanity was not generally allowed to supersede the necessity of his consent The causes of the dissolution of matrimony have varied among the Ro mans 5 but the most solemn sacrament the confarreation itself might always be done away by rights of a contrary tendency In the first ages the father of a family might sell his children and his wife was reckoned in the number of his children the domestic judge might pronounce the death of the offender or his mercy might expel her from his bed and house but the slavery of the wretched female was hopeless and perpetual unless he asserted for his own convenience the manly prerogative of divorce The warmest applause has been lavished on the virtue of the Romans who abstained from the exercise of this tempting pri vilege above five hundred years 6 but the same fact evinces the unequal terms of a connexion in which the slave was unable to renounce her tyrant and the ty rant was unwilling to relinquish his slave When the Roman matrons became the equal and voluntary companions of their lords a new jurisprudence was intro fl Solon requires three payments per month By the Misna a daily debt was imposed on an idle vigorous young husband twice a week on a eitizen once on a peasant once in thirty days on a carael di

Passion inte rest or caprice suggested daily motives for thÂ dissolution of marriage a word a sigh a message a letter the mandate of afreedman declared the separation the most tender of human connexions was degraded to a transient society of profit or pleasure According to the various conditions of life both sexes alternately felt the disgrace and injury an inconstant spouse transferred her wealth to a new family abandoning a numerous perhaps a spurious progeny to tha paternal au thority and care of her late husband a beautiful virgin might be dismissed to the world old indigent and friendless but the reluctance of the Romans when they were pressed to marriage by Augustus sufficiently marks that the prevailing in stitutions were least favourable to the males A specious theory is confuted by this free and perfect experiment which demonstrates that the liberty of divorce does not contribute to happiness and virtue The facility of separation would de stroy all mutual confidence and inflame every trifling dispute the minute differ ence between a husband and a stranger which might so easily be removed might still more easily be forgotten and the matron who in five years can submit to the embraces of eight husbands must cease to reverence the chastity of her own person fl Insufficient remedies followed with distant and tardy steps the rapid progress of the evil The ancient worship of the Romans afforded a peculiar goddess to hear and reconcile the complaints of a married life but her epithet of Virijila ca 2 the appeaser of husbands too clearly indicates on which side submission and repentance were always expected Every act of a citizen was subject to the judgment of the censors the first who used the privilege of divorce assigned at their command the motives of this conduct 3 and a senator was expelled for dismissing his virgin spouse without the knowledge or advice of his friends Whenever an action was instituted for the recovery of a marriage portion the pretor as the guardian of equity examined the cause and the characters and gently inclined the scale in favour of the guiltless and injured party Augustus â who united the powers of both magistrates adopted their different modes of re pressing or chastising the license of divorce 4 The presence of seven Roman witnesses was required for the validity of this solemn and deliberate act if any adequate provocation had been given by the husband instead of the delay of two years he was compelled to refund immediately or in the space of six months but if he could arraign the manners of his wife her guilt or levity was expiated by the loss of the sixth or eighth part of her marriage portion The Christian princes were the first who specified the just causes of a private divorce their in stitutions from Constantine to Justinian appear to fluctuate between the custom of the empire and the wishes of the churcn 5 and the author of the Novels too frequently reforms the jurisprudence of the Code and Pandects In the most ri gorous laws a wife was condemned to support a gamester a drunkard or a liber tine unless he were guilty of homicide poison or sacrilege in which cases the marriage as it should seem might have been dissolved by the hand of the execu tioner But the sacred right of the husband was invariably maintained to deliver his name and family from the disgrace of adultery the list of mortal sins either male or female was curtailed and enlarged by successive regulations and the ob stacles of incurable impotence long absence and monastic profession were al lowed to rescind the matrimonial obligation Whoever transgressed the permis sion of the law was subject to various and heavy penalties The woman was 1 â â sic fiunt octo mariti Qulnque per autumuos Juvenal

restored the liberty of divorce by mutual consent the civilians were unanimous l the theologians were divided 2 and the ambiguous word which contains the precepts of Christ is flexible to any interpretation that the wisdom of a legislator can demand The freedom of love and marriage was restrained among the Romans by natu ral and civil impediments An instinct almost innate and universal appears to prohibit the incestuous commerce 3 of parents and children in the infinite series of ascending and descending generations Concerning the oblique and collateral branches nature is indifferent reason mute and custom various and arbitrary In Egypt the marriage of brothers and sisters was admitted without scruple or ex ception a Spartan might espouse the daughter of his father an Athenian that of his mother and the nuptials of an uncle with his niece was applauded at Athens as a happy union of the dearest relations The profane lawgivers of Rome were never tempted by interest or superstition to multiply the forbidden degrees but they inflexibly condemned the marriage of sisters and brothers hesitated whether first cousins should be touched by the same interdict revered the parental cha racter of aunts and uncles and treated affinity and adoption as a just imitation of the ties of blood According to the proud maxims of the republic a legal mar riage could only be contracted by free citizens an honourable at least an ingenu ous birth was required for the spouse of a senator but the blood of kings could never mingle in legitimate nuptials with the blood of a

continued in a state of celibacy Her modest station below the honours of a wife above the in famy of a prostitute was acknowledged and approved by the laws from the age of Augustus to the tenth century the use of this secondary marriage prevailed both in the west and east and the humble virtues of a concubine were often pre ferred to the pomp and insolence of a noble matron In this connexion the two Antonines the best of princes and of men enjoyed the comforts of domestic love the example was imitated by many citizens impatient of celibacy but regardful of their families If at any time they desired to legitimate their natural children the conversion was instantly performed by the celebration of their nuptials with a partner whose fruitfulness and fidelity they had already tried By this epithet of natural the offspring of the concubine were distinguished from the spurious blood of adultery prostitution and incest to whom Justinian reluctantly grants the ne cessary aliments of

chil dren of the state 1 The relation of guardian and ward or in Roman words of tutor and ftufiil which cover so many titles of the Institutes and Pandects 2 is of a very simple and uniform nature The person and property of an orphan must always be trusted to the custody of some discreet friend If the deceased rather had not signified his choice the agnats or paternal kindred of the nearest degree were compelled to act as the natural guardians the Athenians were apprehensive of exposing the infant to the power of those most interested in his death but an axiom of Roman jurisprudence has pronounced that the charge of tutelage should constantly attend the emolument of succession If the choice of the father and the line of consanguinity afforded no efficient guardian the failure was Supplied by the nomination of the pretor of the city or the president of the province But the person whom they named to this fiub ic office might be legally excused by in sanity or blindness by ignorance or inability by previous enmity or adverse inte rest by the number of children or guardianships with which he was already bur dened and by the immunities which were granted to the useful labours of magis trates lawyers physicians and professors Till the infant could speak and think he was represented by the tutor whose authority was finally determined by the age of puberty Without his consent no act of the pupil could bind himself to his own prejudice though it might oblige others for his personal benefit It is need less to observe that the tutor often gave security and always rendered an account and that the want of diligence or integrity exposed him to a civil and almost cri minal action for the violation of his sacred trust The age of puberty had been rashly fixed by the civilians at fourteen but as the faculties of the mind ripen more slowly than those of the body a curator was interposed to guard the fortunes of the Roman youth from his own inexperience and headstrong passions Such a trustee had been first instituted by the pretor to save a family from the blind ha voc of a prodigal or a madman and the minor was compelled by the laws to so licit the same protection to give validity to his acts till he accomplished the full period of twenty five years Women were condemmed to the perpetual tutelage of parents husbands or guardians a sex created to please and obey was never supposed to have attained the age of reason and experience Such at least was the stern and haughty spirit of the ancient law which had been insensibly molli fied before the time of Justinian II The original right of property can only be justified by the accident or merit of prior occupancy and on this foundation it is wisely established by the philoso phy of the

kingdoms In the language of ancient jurisprudence which was corrupted and forgotten before the age of Justinian these spoils were distinguished by the name of manceps or mancifiium taken with the hand and whenever they were sold or em ancip ated the purchaser required some assurance that they had been the property of an enemy and not of a fellow citizen 2 A citizen could only forfeit his rights by apparent dereliction and such dereliction of a valuable interest could not easily be presumed Yet according to the twelve ta bles a prescription of one year for moveables and of two years for immoveables abolished the claim of the ancient master if the actual possessor had acquired them by a fair transaction from the person whom he believed to be the lawful pro prietor Such conscientious injustice without any mixture of fraud or force could seldom injure the members of a small republic but the various periods of three of ten or of twenty years determined by Justinian are more suitable to the latitude of a great empire It is only in the term of prescription that the distinc tion of real and personal fortune has been remarked by the civilians and their ge neral idea of property is that of simple uniform and absolute dominion The su bordinate exceptions of use of usufruct 4 of servitudes imposed for the bene fit of a neighbour on lands and houses are abundantly explained by the professors of jurisprudence The claims of property as far as they are altired by the mixture the division or the transformation of substances are investigated with metaphy sical subtlety by the same civilians The personal title of the first proprietor must be determined by his death but the possession without any appearance of change is peaceably continued in his children the associates of his toil and the partners of his wealth This natural inheritance has been protected by the legislators of every climate and age and the father is encouraged to persevere in slow and distant improvements by the tender hope that a long posterity will enjoy the fruits of his labour The principle of hereditary succession is universal but the order has been variously established by convenience or caprice by the spirit of national institutions or by some partial example which was originally decided by fraud or violence The jurisprudence of the Romans appears to have deviated from the equality of nature

citizen all his descendants unless they were already freed from his paternal power were called to the inheritance of his possessions The insolent prerogative of primogeniture was unknown the two sexes were placed on a just level all the sons and daughters were entitled to an equal portion of the patrimo nial estate and if any of the sons had been intercepted by a premature death his person was represented and his share was divided by his surviving children On the failure of the direct line the right of succession must diverge to the collateral branches The degrees of kindred 4 are numbered by the civilians ascending from the last possessor to a common parent and descending from the common pa rent to the next heir my father stands in the first degree my brother in the se cond his children in the third and the remainder of the series may be conceived by fancy or pictured in a genealogical table In this computation a distinction was made essential to the laws and even the constitution of Rome the agnats or persons connected by a line of males were called as they stood in the nearest de gree to an equal partition but a female was incapable of transmitting any legal claims and the cognats of every rank without excepting the dear relation of a mother and a son were disinherited by the twelve tables as strangers and aliens  Among the Romans a gens or lineage was united by a common name and do mestic rites the various cognomens or surnames of Scipio or Marcellus distin guished from each other the subordinate branches or families of the Cornelian or Claudian race the default of the agnats of the same surname was supplied by the larger denomination of Gentiles and the vigilance of the laws maintained in the same name the perpetual descent of religion and property A similar prin ciple dictated the Voconian law 5 which abolished the right of female inheri tance As long as virgins were given or sold in marriage the adoption of the wife extinguished the hopes of the daughter But the equal succession of inde pendent matrons supported their pride and luxury and might transport into a fo reign house the riches of their fathers While the maxims of Cato 6 were re vered they tended to perpetuate in each family a just and virtuous mediocrity till female blandishments insensibly triumphed and every salutary restraint was lost in the dissolute greatness of the republic The rigour of the decemvirs was tem pered by the equity of the pretors Their edicts restored emancipated and post humous children to the rights of nature and upon the failure of the agnats they preferred the blood of the cognats to the name of the Gentiles whose title and character were insensibly covered with oblivion The reciprocal inheritance of mothers and sons was established in the Tertullian and Orphitian decrees by the humanity of the senate A new and more impartial order was introduced by the novels of Justinian who affected to revive the jurisprudence of the twelve tables The lines of masculine and female kindred were confounded the descending as cending and collateral series was accurately denned and each degree according to the proximity of blood and affection succeeded to the vacant possessions of a Roman citizen 7 The order of succession is regulated by nature or at least by the general and Sermanent reason of the law giver but this order is

of Solon and the private testaments of the father of a family are authorized by the twelve ta bles Before the time of the decemvirs l a Roman citizen exposed his wishes and motives to the assembly of thirty curia or parishes and the general law of in heritance was suspended by an occasional act of the legislature After the per mission of the decemvirs each private lawgiver promulgated his verbal or written testament in the presence of five citizens who represented the five classes of the Roman people a sixth witness attested their concurrence a seventh weighed the copper money which was paid by an imaginary purchaser and the estate was emancipated by a fictitious sale and immediate release This singular cere mony which excited the wonder of the Greeks was still practised in the age of Severus but the pretors had already approved a more simple testament for which they required the seals and signatures of seven witnesses free from all le gal exception and purposely summoned for the execution of that important act A domestic monarch who reigned over the fives and fortunes of his children might distribute their respective shares according to the degrees of their merit or his affection his arbitrary displeasure chastised an unworthy son by the loss of his inheritance and the mortifying preference of a stranger But the experience of unnatural parents recommended some limitations of their testamentary powers A son or by the laws of Justinian even a daughter could no longer be disinheri ted by their silence they were compelled to name the criminal and to specify the offence and the justice of the emperor enumerated the sole causes that could jus tify such a violation of the first principles of nature and society 3 Unless a legi timate portion a fourth part had been reserved for the children they were enti tled to institute an action or complaint of inofficious testament to suppose that their father s understanding was impaired by sickness or age and respectfully to appeal frem his rigorous sentence to the deliberate wisdom of the magistrate In the Ro man jurisprudence an essential distinction was admitted between the inheritance and the legacies The heirs who succeeded to the entire unity or to any of the twelve fractions of the substance of the testator represented his civil and religious character asserted his rights fulfilled his obligations and discharged the gifts of friendship or liberality which his last will had bequeathed under the name of le gacies But as the imprudence or prodigality of a dying man might exhaust the inheritance and leave only risk and labour to his successor he was empowered to retain the Falcidian portion to deduct before the payment of the legacies a clear fourth for his own emolument A reasonable time was allowed to examine the proportion between the debts and the estate to decide whether he should accept or refuse the testament and if he used the benefit of an inventory the demands of the creditors could not exceed the valuation of the effects The last will of a citi zen might be altered during his life or rescinded after his death the persons whom he named might die before him or reject the inheritance or be exposed to some legal disqualification In the contemplation of these events he was permitted to substitute second and third heirs to replace each other according to the order of the testament and the incapacity of a madman or an infant to bequeath his pro perty might be supplied by a similar substitution 4 But the power of the testa tor expired with the acceptance of the testament each Roman of mature age and discretion acquired the absolute dominion of his inheritance and the simplicity of the civil law was never clouded by the long and intricate entails which confine the happiness and freedom of unborn generations Conquest and the formalities of law established the use of codicils If a Ro man was surprised by death in a remote province of the empire he

Augus tus were not authorized to enforce A codicil might be expressed in any mode or in any language but the subscription of five witnesses must declare that it was the genuine composition of the author His intention however laudable was some times illegal and the invention of fidei commUsa or trusts arose from the struggle between natural justice and positive jurisprudence A stranger of Greece or Africa might be the friend or benefactor of a childless Roman but none except afellow citi zen could act as his heir The Voconian law which abolished female succession re strained the legacy or inheritance of a woman to the sum of one hundred thousand sesterces l and an only daughter was condemned almost as an alien in her fa ther s house The zeal of friendship and parental affection suggested a liberal artifice a qualified citizen was named in the testament with a prayer or injunction that he would restore the inheritance to the person for whom it was truly intend ed Various was the conduct of the trustees in this painful situation they had sworn to observe the laws of their country but honour prompted them to violate their oath and if they preferred their interest under the mask of patriotism they forfeited the esteem of every virtuous mind The declaration of Augustus relieved their doubts gave a legal sanction to confidential testaments and codicils and gen tly unravelled the forms and restraints of the republican jurisprudence 2 But as the newpractice of trusts degenerated into some abuse the trustee was enabled by the Trebellian and Pegasian decrees to reserve one fourth of the estate or to transfer on the head of the real heir all the debts and actions of the succession The interpretation of testaments was strict and literal but the language of trusts and codicils was delivered from the minute and technical accuracy of the civi lians 3 III The general duties of mankind are imposed by their public and private re lations but their specific obligations to each other can only be the effect of 1 a promise 2 a benefit or 3 an injury and when these obligations are ratified by law the interested party may compel the performance by a judicial action On this principle the civilians of every country have erected a similar jurisprudence the fair conclusion of universal reason and justice 4 1 The goddess of faith of human and social faith was worshipped not only in her temples but in the lives of the Romans and if that nation was deficient in the more amiable qualities of benevolence and generosity they astonished the Greeks by their sincere and simple performance of the most burdensome engagements 5 Yet among the same people according to the rigicl maxims of the patricians and decemvirs a naked fiact a promise or even an oath did not create any civil obli gation unless it was confirmed by the legal form of a stimulation Whatever might be the etymology of the Latin word it conveyed the idea of a firm and irrevocable contract which was always expressed in the mode of a question and answer Do you promise to pay me one hundred pieces of gold â was the solemn interrogation of Seius I do promiseâ was the reply of Sempronius The friends of Semproni us who answered for his ability and inclination might be separately sued at the option of Seius and the benefit of partition or order of reciprocal actions insensi bly deviated from the strict theory of stipulation The most cautious and delibe rate consent was justly required to sustain the validity of a gratuitous promise and the citizen who might have obtained a legal security incurred the suspicion of fraud and paid the forfeit of his neglect But the ingenuity of the civilians suc cessfully laboured to convert simple engagements into the form of solemn stipula tions The pretors as the guardians of social faith admitted every rational evi dence of a voluntary and deliberate act which in their tribunal produced an equi table obligation and for which they gave an action and a remedy 6 1 Dion Castiut torn ii Ivi p su with Reiraar s Notes specifies in Greek money the sum of twenty fire thousand drachms 2 The revolutions of the Roman laws of inheritance are

A grateful re turn is due to the author of a benefit and whoever is intrusted with the property of another has bound himself to the sacred duty of restitution In the case of a friendly loan the merit of generosity is on the side of the lender only in a deposite  on the side of the receiver but in a pledge and the rest of the selfish commerce of ordinary life the benefit is compensated by an equivalent and the obligation to restore is variously modified by the nature of the transaction The Latin language very happily expresses the fundamental difference between the commodalum and the mutuum which our poverty is reduced to confound under the vague and com mon appellation of a loan In the former the borrower was obliged to restore the same individual thing with which be had been accommodated for the temporary supply of his wants in the latter it was destined for his use and consumption and he discharged this mutual engagement by substituting the same specific value according to a just estimation of number of weight and of measure In the con tract of sale the absolute dominion is transferred to the purchaser and he repays the benefit with an adequate sum of gold or silver the price and universal standard of all earthly possessions The obligation of another contract that of location is of a more complicated kind Lands or houses labour or talents may be hired for a definite term at the expiration of the time the thing itself must be restored to the owner with an additional reward for the beneficial occupation and employment In these lucrative contracts to which may be added those of partnership and com missions the civilians sometimes imagine the delivery of the object and sometimes presume the consent of the parties The substantial pledge has been refined into the invisible rights of a mortgage or hyfwtheca and the agreement of sale for a certain price imputes from that moment the chances of gain or loss to the ac count of the purchaser It may be fairly supposed that every man will obey the dictates of his interest and if he accepts the benefit he is obliged to sustain the expense of the transaction In this boundless subject the historian will ob serve the location of land and money the rent of the one and the interest of the other as they materially affect the prosperity of agriculture and commerce The land lord was often obliged to advance the stock andinstruments of husbandry and to con tent himself with a partition of the fruits If the feeble tenant was oppressed by acci dent contagion or hostile violence he claimed a proportionable relief from the equi ty of the laws five years were the customary term and no solid or costly improvements could be expected from a farmer who at each moment might be ejected by the sale of the estate 2 Usury 3 the inveterate grievance of the city had been dis couraged by the twelve tables 4 and abolished by the clamours of the people It â was revived by their wants and idleness

impose the strict obligation of repairing an injury and the sufferer by private injustice acquires a personal right and a legitimate action If the property of another be intrusted to our care the requisite degree of care may rise and fall according to the benefit which we derive from such temporary possession we are seldom made responsible for inevitable accident but the con sequences of a voluntary fault must always be imputed to the author 3 A Ro man pursued and recovered his stolen goods by a civil action of theft they might pass through a succession of pure and innocent hands but nothing less than a pre scription of thirty years could extinguish his original claim They were restored by the sentence of the pretor and the injury was compensated by double or three fold or even quadruple damages as the deed had been perpetrated by secret fraud or open rapine as the robber had been surprised in the fact or detected by a subsequent research The Aquilian law 4 defended the living property of a citizen nis slaves and cattle from the stroke of malice or negligence the highest â price was allowed that could be ascribed to the domestic animal at any moment of the year preceding his death a similar latitude of thirty days was granted on the destruction of any other valuable effects A personal injury is blunted or sharp ened by the manners of the times and the sensibility of the individual the pain or disgrace of a word or blow cannot easily be appreciated by a pecuniary equi valent The rude jurisprudence of the decemvirs had confounded all hasty insults which did not amount to the fracture of a limb by condemning the aggressor to the common penalty of twenty five asses But the same denomination of money was reduced in three centuries from a pound to the weight of half an ounce and the insolence of a wealthy Roman indulged himself iÂ the cheap amusement of breaking and satisfying the law of the twelve tables Veratius ran through the streets striking on the face the inoffensive passengers and his attendant purse bearer immediately silenced their clamours by the legal tender of twenty five pieces of copper about the value of one shilling 5 The equity of thepretors examined and estimated the distinct merits of each particular complaint In the adjudication of civil damages the magistrate assumed a right to consider the va rious circumstances of time and place of age and dignity which may aggravate the shame and sufferings of the injured person but if he admitted the idea of a fine a punishment an example he invaded the province though perhaps he supplied the defects of the criminal law The execution of the Alban dictator who was dismembered by eight horses is represented by Livy as the first and last instance of Roman cruelty in the punish ment of the most atrocious crimes 6 But this act of justice or revenge was in flicted on a foreign enemy in the heat of victory and at the command of a single man The twelve tables afforded a more decisive proof of the national spirit since they were framed by the wisest of the senate and accepted by the free voices of the people yet these laws like the statutes of Draco 7 are written in characters of blood 8 They approve the inhuman and unequal principle of retaliation and the forfeit of an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth a limb for a limb is rigorously 1

parricide who violated the du ties of nature and gratitude was cast into the river or the sea enclosed in a sack and a cock a viper a dog and a monkey were successively added as the most suitable

twelve tables against insolvent debtors still remains to be told and I shall dare to prefer the lite ral sense of antiquity to the specious refinements of modern criticism 5 After the judicial prool or confession of the debt thirty days of grace were allowed be fore a Roman was delivered into the power of his fellow citizens In this private prison twelve ounces of rice was his daily food he might be bound with a chain of fifteen pounds weight and his misery was thrice exposed in the market place to solicit the compassion of his friends and countrymen At the expiration of six ty days the debt was discharged by the loss of liberty or life the insolvent debtor was either put to death or sold in foreign slavery beyond the Tiber but if several creditors were alike obstinate and unrelenting they might legally dismember his body and satiate their revenge by his horrid partition The advocates for this savage law have insisted that it must strongly operate in deterring idleness and fraud from contracting debts which they are unable to discharge but experience would dissipate this salutary terror by proving that no creditor could be found to 1 Livy mentions two remarkable and

THE DECLINE AND FALL  exact this unprofitable penalty of life or limb As the manners of Rome were in sensibly polished the criminal code of the decemvirs was abolished by the humani ty of accusers witnesses and judges and impunity became the consequence of im moderate rigour The Porcian and Valerian laws prohibited the magistrates from inflicting on a free citizen any capital or even corporal punishment and the obsolete statutes of blood were artfully and perhaps truly ascribed to the spirit not of patrician but of regal tyranny In the absence of penal laws and the insufficiency of civil actions the peace and justice of the city were imperfectly maintained by the private jurisdiction of the citizens The malefactors who replenish our gaols are the outcasts of society and the crimes for which they suffer may be commonly ascribed to ignorance poverty and brutal appetite For the perpetration of similar enormities a vile plebeian might claim and abuse the sacred character of a member of the republic but on the proof or suspicion of guilt the slave or the stranger was nailed to a cross and this strict and summary justice might be exercised without restraint over the great est part of the populace of Rome Each family contained a domestic tribunal which was not confined like that of the pretor to the cognizance of external ac tions virtuous principles and habits were inculcated by the discipline of education and the Roman father was accountable to the state for the manners of his children Since he deposed without appeal of their life their liberty and their inheritance In some pressing emergencies the citizen was authorized to avenge his private or public wrongs The consent of the Jewish the Athenian and the Roman laws approved the slaughter of the nocturnal thief though in open daylight a robber could not be slain without some previous evidence of danger and complaint Who ever surprised an adulterer in his nuptial bed might freely exercise his revenge l the most bloody or wanton outrage was excused by the provocation 2 nor was it before the reign of Augustus that the husband was reduced to weigh the rank of the offender or that the parent was condemned to sacrifice his daughter with her guilty seducer After the expulsion of the kings the ambitious Roman who should dare to assume their title or imitate their tyranny was devoted to the infernal gods each of his fellow citizens was armed with a sword of justice and the act of Brutus however repugnant to gratitude or prudence had been already sanctified by the judgment of his country 3 The barbarous practice of wearing arms in the midst of peace 4 and the bloody maxims of honour were unknown to the Ro mans and during the two purest ages from the establishment of equal freedom to the end of the Punic wars the city was never disturbed by sedition and rarely polluted with atrocious crimes The failure of penal laws was more sensibly felt when every vice was inflamed by faction at home and dominion abroad In the time of Cicero each private citizen enjoyed the privilege of anarchy each minis ter of the republic was exalted to the temptations of legal power and their vir tues are entitled to the warmest praise as the spontaneous fruits of nature or phi losophy After a triennial indulgence of lust rapine and cruelty Verres the ty rant of Sicily could only be sued for the pecuniary restitution of three hundred thousand pounds sterling and such was the temper of the laws the judges and perhaps the accuser himself 5 that on refunding a thirteenth part of his plunder Verres could retire to an easy and luxurious exile 6 The first imperfect attempt to restore the proportion of crimes and punishments was made by the dictator Sylla who in the midst of his sanguinary triumph as pired to restrain the license rather than to oppress the liberty of the Romans He gloried in the arbitrary proscription of four thousand seven hundred citizens 7 1 The first speech of Lysias R iske Orator Gitec torn v p 2â

betrayed an army or the magistrate who ruined a province Sylla was content to aggravate the pecuniary damages by the penalty of exile or in more constitutional language by the interdiction of fire and water The Cornelian and afterwards the Pompeian and Julian laws introduced a new system of criminal ju risprudence 1 and the emperors from Augustus to Justinian disguised their in creasing rigour under the names of the uriginal authors But the invention and frequent use of extraordinary fiains proceeded from the desire to extend and con ceal the progress of despotism In the condemnation of illustrious Romans the senate was always prepared to confound at the will of their masters the judicial and legislative powers It was the duty of the governors to maintain the peace of their province by the arbitrary and rigid administration of justice the freedom of the city evaporated in the extent of the empire and the Spanish malefactor who claimed the privilege of a Roman was elevated by the command of Galba on a fairer and more lofty cross 2 Occasional receipts issued from the throne to de cide the questions which by their novelty or importance appeared to surpass the authority and discernment of a proconsul Transportation and beheading were reserved for honourable persons meaner criminals were either hanged or burnt or buried in the mines or exposed to the wild beasts of the amphitheatre Armed robbers were pursued and extirpated as the enemies of society the driving away horses or cattle was made a capital offence 3 but simple theft was uniformly considered as a mere civil and private injury The degrees of guilt and the modes of punishment were too often determined by the discretion of the rulers and the subject was left in ignorance of the legal danger which he might incur by every action of his life A sin a vice a crime are the objects of theology ethics and jurisprudence Whenever their judgments agree they corroborate each other but as often as they differ a prudent legislator appreciates the guilt and punishment according to the measure of social injury On this principle the most daring attack on the life and property of a private citizen is judged less atrocious than the crime of treason or rebellion which invades the majesty of the republic the obse quious civilians unanimously pronounced that the republic is contained in the person of its chief and the edge of the Julian law was sharpened by the inces sant diligence of the emperors The licentious commerce of the sexes may be tolerated as an impulse of nature or forbidden as a source of disorder and cor ruption but the fame the fortunes the family of the husband are seriously in â jured by the adultery of the wife The wisdom of Augustus after curbing the freedom of revenge applied to this domestic offence the animadversion of the laws and the guilty parties after the payment of heavy forfeitures and fines were condemned to long or perpetual exile in two separate islands 4 Religion pronounces an equal censure against the infidelity of the husband but as it is not accompanied by the same civil effects the wife was never permitted to vindicate her wrongs 5 and the distinction of

were infected by the example of the Etruscans l and Greeks 2 in the mad abuse of prosperity and power every pleasure that is innocent was deemed insipid and the Scatinian law 3 which had been extorted by an act of violence was insensibly abolished by the lapse of time and the multitude of cri minals By this law the rape perhaps the seduction of an ingenuous youth was compensated as a personal injury by the poor damages of ten thousand sesterces or fourscore pounds the ravisher might be slain by the resistance or revenge of chastity and I wish to believe that at HÂ me as in Athens the voluntary and ef feminate deserter of his sex was degraded from the honours and the rights of a citizen 4 But the practice of vice was not discouraged by the severity of opi nion the indelible stain of manhood was confounded with the more venial trans  gressions of fornication and adultery nor was the licentious lover exposed to the same dishonour which he impressed on the male or female partner of his guilt From Catullus to Juvenal 5 the poets accuse and celebrate the degeneracy of the times and the reformation of manners was feebly attempted by the reason and authority of the civilians till the most virtuous of the Caesars proscribed the sin against nature as a crime against society 6 A new spirit of legislation respectable even in its error arose in the empire with the religion of Constantine 7 The laws of Moses were received as the divine original of justice and the Christian princes adapted their penal statutes to the degrees of moral anc religious turpitude Adultery was first declared to be a capital offence the frailty of the sexes was assimilated to poison or assassination to sorcery or parricide the same penalties were inflicted on the passive and ac tive guilt of paederasty and all criminals of free or servile condition were either drowned or beheaded or cast alive into the avenging flames The adulterers were spared by the common sympathy of mankind but the lovers of their own sex were pursued by general and pious indignation the impure manners of Greece still prevailed in the cities of Asia and every vice was fomented by the celibacy of the monks and clergy Justinian relaxed the punishment at least of female in fidelity the guilty spouse was only condemned to solitude and penance and at the end of two years she might be recalled to the arms of a forgiving husband But the same emperor declared himself the implacable enemy of unmanly lust and the cruelty or his persecution can scarcely be excused by the purity of his mo tives 8 In defiance of every principle of justice he stretched to past as well as future offences the operations of his edicts with the previous allowance of a short respite for confession and pardon A painful death was inflicted by the am putation of the sinful instrument or the insertion of sharp reeds into the pores and tubes of most exquisite sensibility and Justinian defended the propriety of  the execution since the criminals would have lost their hands had they been con victed of sacrilege In this state of disgrace and agony two bishops Isaiah of Rhodes and Alexander of Diospolis were dragged through

the rich and of the enemies of Theodora was presumed by the judges and pederasty became the crime of those to whom no crime could be imputed A French philosopher l has dared to remark that whatever is secret must be doubtful and that our natural horror of vice may abused as an engine of tyranny But the favourable pursuasion of the same writer that a legislator may confide in the taste and reason of mankind is impeached by the unwelcome disco very of the antiquity and extent of the disease 2 The free citizens of Athens and Rome enjoyed in all criminal cases the invaluable privilege of being tried by their country 3 1 The administration of justice is the most ancient office of a prince it was exercised by the Roman kings and abused by Tarquin who alone without law or council pronounced his arbitrary judg ments The first consuls succeeded to this regal prerogative but the sacred right of appeal soon abolished the jurisdiction of the magistrates and all public causes were decided by the supreme tribunal of the people But a wild democracy su perior to the forms too often disdains the essential principles of justice the pride of despotism was envenomed by plebeian envy and the neroes of Athens might sometimes applaud the happiness of the Persian whose fate depended on the ca price of a single tyrant Some salutary restraints imposed by the people on their own passions were at once the cause and effect of the gravity and temperance of the Romans The right of accusation was confined to the magistrates A vote of the thirty five tribes could inflict a fine but the cognizance of all natural crimes was re served by a fundamental law to the assembly of the centuries in which the weight of influence and property was sure to preponderate Repeated proclamations and ad journments were interposed to allow time for prejudice and resentment to subside the whole proceeding might be annulled by a seasonable omen or the opposition of a tribune and such popular trials were commonly less formidable to innocence than they were favourable to guilt But this union of the judicial and legislative powers left it doubtful whether the accused party was pardoned or acquitted and in the defence of an illustrious client the orators of Rome and Athens addressed their arguments to the policy and benevolence as well as to the justice of their sove reign 2 The task of convening the citizens for the trial of each offender became more difficult as the citizens and the offenders continually multiplied and the rea dy expedient was adopted of delegating the jurisdiction of the people to the ordi nary magistrates or to extraordinary inquisitors In the first ages these ques tions were rare and occasional In the beginning of the seventh century of Roma they were made perpetual for pretors were annually expowered to sit in judg ment on the state offences of treason extortion peculation and bribery and Syl la added new pretors and new questions for those crimes which more directly in jure the safety of individuals By these inquisitors the trial was prepared and di rected but they could only pronounce the sentence of the majority of judges who with some truth and more prejudice have been compared to the English ju ries 4 To discharge this important though burdensome office an annual list of ancient and respectable citizens was formed by the pretor After many constitu tional struggles they were chosen in equal numbers from the senate the eques trian order and the people four hundred and fifty were appointed for single ques tions and the various rolls or decuries of judges must have contained the names of some thousand Romans who represented the judicial authority of the state In each particular cause a sufficient number was drawn from the urn their inte grity was guarded by an oath the mode of ballot secured their independence the suspicion of partiality was removed by the mutual challenges of the accuser and 1 Montesquieu Esprit des Lois lib xii c 6 That eloquent

fifteen on each si de â were reduced to fifty one voices or tablets of acquittal of condemnation or of fa vourable doubt 1 3 In this civil jurisdiction the pretorof the city was truly a judge and almost a legislator but as soon as he had prescribed the action of law he often referred to a delegate the determination of the fact With the increase of legal proceedings the tribunal of the centumvirs in which he presided ac quired more weight and reputation But whether he acted alone or with the ad vice of his council the most absolute powers might be trusted to a magistrate who was annually chosen by the votes of the people The rules and precautions of freedom have required some explanation the order of despotism is simple and in animate Before the age of Justinian or perhaps of Diocletian the decuries of Roman judges had sunk to an empty title the humble advice of the assessors might be accepted or despised and in each tribunal the civil and criminal juris diction was administered by a single magistrate who was raised and disgraced by the will of the emperor A Roman accused of any capital crime might prevent the sentence of the law by voluntary exile or death Till his guilt had been legally proved his inno cence was presumed and his person was free till the votes of the last century had been counted and declared he might peaceably secede to any of the allied cities of Italy or Greece or Asia 2 His fame and fortunes were preserved at least to his children by this civil death and he might still be happy in every rational and sensual enjoyment if a mind accustomed to the ambitious tumult of Rome could support the uniformity and silence of Rhodes or Athens A bolder effort was required to escape from the tyranny of the Cxsars but this effort was ren dered familiar by the maxims of the stoics the examples of the bravest Romans and the legal encouragements of suicide The bodies of condemned criminals were exposed to public ignominy and their children a more serious evil were re duced to poverty by the confiscation of their fortunes But if the victims of Ti berius and Nero anticipated the decree of the prince or senate their courage and despatch were recompensed by the applause of the public the decent honours of burial and the validity of their testaments 3 The exquisite avarice and cru elty of Domitian appeared to have deprived the unfortunate of this last consola tion and it Was still denied even by the clemency of the Antonines A voluntary death which in the case of a capital offence intervened between the accusation and the sentence was admitted as a confession of guilt and the spoils of the de ceased were seized by the human claims of the treasury 4 Yet the civilians have always respected the natural right of a citizen to dispose of his life and the posthumous disgrace invented by Tarquin 5 to check the despair of his subjects was never revived or imitated by succeeding tyrants The powers of this world have indeed lost their dominion over him who is resolved on death and his arm can only be restrained by the religious apprehension of a future state Suicides are enumerated by Virgil among the unfortunate rather than the guilty 6 and the poetical fables of the infernal shades could not seriously influence the faith or Jiractice of mankind But the precepts of the gospel or the church have at ength imposed a pious servitude on the minds of Christians and condemn them to expect without a murmur the last stroke of disease or the executioner The penal statutes form a very small proportion of the sixty two books of the code and pandects and in all judicial proceeding the life or death of a citizen is determined with less caution and delay than the most ordinary question of cove nant or inheritance This singular distinction though something may be allowed for the urgent necessity of defending the peace of society is derived from the na Â 1 We are indebted for this interesting fact to a fragment of

on brass or marble but on the conscience of the offender and his guilt is commonly proved by the testimony of a single fact But our relations to each other are various and infinite our obligations are created annulled and modified by injuries benefits and promises and the interpretation of voluntary contracts and testaments which are often dictated by fraud or ignorance affords a long and laborious exercise to the sagacity of the judge The business of life is multiplied by the extent of commerce and dominion and the residence of the parties in the distant provinces of an empire is productive of doubt delay and inevitable appeals from the local to the supreme magistrate Justinian the Greek emperor ot Constantinople and the east was the legal successor of the Latian shepherd who had planted a colo ny on the banks of the Tiber In a period of thirteen hundred years the laws had reluctantly followed the changes of government and manners and the lauda ble desire of conciliating ancient names with recent institutions destroyed the harmony and swelled the magnitude of the obscure and irregular system The laws which excuse on any occasions the ignorance of their subjects confess their own imperfections the civil jurisprudence as it was abridged by Justinian still continued a mysterious science and a profitable trade and the innate perplexity of the study was involved in tenfold darkness by the private industry of the prac titioners The expense of the pursuit sometimes exceeded the value ot the prize and the fairest rights were abandoned by the poverty or prudence of the claimants Such costly justice might tend to abate the spirit of litigation but the unequal pressure serves only to increase the influence of the rich and to aggravate the misery of the poor By these dilatory and expensive proceedings the wealthy pleader obtains a more certain advantage than he could hope from the accidental corruption of his judge The experience of an abuse from which our own age and country are not perfectly exempt may sometimes provoke a generous indig nation and extort the hasty wish of exchanging our elaborate jurisprudence for the simple and summary decrees of a Turkish cadhi Our calmer reflection will suggest that such forms and delays are necessary to guard the person and pro perty of the citizen that the discretion of the judge is the first engine of tyranny and that the laws of a free people should foresee and determine every question that may probably arise in the exercise of power and the transactions of industry But the government of Justinian united the evils of liberty and servitude and the Romans were oppressed at the same time by the multiplicity of their laws and the arbitrary will of their master CHAPTER XLV lieign of the younger Justin â

domestics were awakened by an importunate crowd who thundered at  his door and obtained admittance by revealing themselves to be the principal members of the senate These welcome deputies announced the recent and mo mentous secret of the emperor s decease reported or perhaps invented his dy ing choice of the best beloved and the most deserving of his nephews and con jured Justin to prevent the disorders of the multitude if they should perceive with the return of light that they were left without a master After composing his countenance to surprise sorrow and decent modesty Justin by the advice of his wife Sophia submitted to the authority of the senate He was conducted with speed and silence to the palace the guards saluted their new sovereign and the martial and religious rites of his coronation were diligently accomplished By the hands of the proper officers he was invested with the imperial garments the red buskins white tunic and the purple robe A fortunate soldier whom he in stantly promoted to the rank of tribune encircled his neck with a military collar four robust youths exalted him on a shield he stood firm and erect to receive the adoration of his subjects and their choice was sanctioned by the benediction of the patriarch who imposed the diadem on the head of an orthodox prince The hippodrome was already filled with innumerable multitudes and ho soonqp did the emperor appear on the throne than the voices of the blue and the green factions â were confounded in the same loyal acclamations In the speeches which Justin addressed to the senate and people he promised to correct the abuses which had disgraced the age of his predecessor displayed the maxims of a just and benefi cent government and declared that on the approaching calends of January l he would revive in his own person the name and liberality of a Roman consul The immediate discharge of his uncle s debts exhibited a solid pledge of his faith and generosity a train of porters laden with bags of gold advanced into the midst of the hippodrome and the hopeless creditors of Justinian accepted this equitable payment as a voluntary gift Before the end of three years his example was imi tated and surpassed by the empress Sophia who delivered many indigent citizens from the weight of debt and usury an act of benevolence the best entitled to gra titude since it relieves the most intolerable distress but in which the bounty of a prince is the most liable to be abused by the claims of prodigality and fraud 2  On the seventh day of his reign Justin gave audience to the ambassadors of the Avars and the scene was decorated to impress the barbarians with astonishment veneration and terror From the palace gate the spacious courts and long por ticos were lined with the lofty crests and gilt bucklers of the guards who pre sented their spears and axes with more confidence than they would have shown in a field of battle The officers who exercised the power or attended the person of the prince were attired in their richest habits and arranged according to the military and civil order of the hierarchy When the veil of the sanctuary was with drawn the ambassadors beheld the emperor of the east on his throne beneath a canopy or dome which was supported by four columns and crowned with a winged figure of victory In the first emotions of surprise they submitted to the servile adoration of the Byzantine court but as soon as they rose from the ground Tar getius the chief of the embassy expressed the freedom and pride of a barbarian He extolled by the tongue of his interpreter the greatness of the chagan by whose clemency the kingdoms of the south were permitted to exist whose victo rious subjects had traversed the frozen rivers of Scythia and who now covered the banks of the Danube with innumerable tents The late emperor had culti vated with annual and costly gifts the friendship of a grateful monarch and the enemies of Rome had respected the allies of the Avars The same prudence would instruct the nephew of Justinian to imitate the liberality of his uncle and to pur chase the blessings of peace from an invincible people who delighted and excelled in the exercise of war The reply of the emperor was delivered in the same strain of haughty defiance anfl he derived his confidence from the God of the Christians the ancient glory of Rome

Retire from our presence the lives of ambassadors are safe and if you return to implore our pardon perhaps you will taste of our benevolence 2 On the re port of his ambassadors the chagan was awed by the apparent firmness of a Ro man emperor of whose character and resources he was ignorant Instead of executing his threats against the eastern empire he marched into the poor and savage countries of Germany which were subject to the dominion of the Franks After the two doubtful battles he consented to retire and the Austrasian king re lieved the distresses of his camp with an immediate supply of corn and cattle 3 Such repeated disappointments had chilled the spirit ot the Avars and their power would have dissolved away in the Sarmatian desert if the alliance of Al boin king of the Lombards had not given a new object to their arms and a last ing settlement to their wearied fortunes While Alboin served under his father s standard he encountered in battle and transpierced with hislance the rival prince of the Gepidx The Lombards who applauded such early prowess requested his father with unanimous acclamations that the heroic youth who had shared the dangers of the field might be admitted to the feast of victory  You are not unmindful replied the inflexible Audoin of the wise customs of our ancestors Whatever may be his merit aprince is inca pable of sitting at table with his father till he has received his arms from a foreign and royal hand Alboin bowed with reverence to the institutions of his country selected forty companions and boldly visited the court of Turisund king of the Gepidx who embraced and entertained according to the laws of hospitality the murderer of his son Â At the banquet whilst Alboin occupied the seat of the youth whom he had slain a tender remembrance arose in the mind of Turisund How dear is that placeâ how hateful is that person were the words that escaped with a sigh from the indignant father His grief exasperated the national resent ment of the Gepidx and Cunimund his surviving son was provoked by wine or fraternal affection to the desire of vengeance  The Lombards said the rude barbarian resemble in figure and smell the mares of our Sarmatian plains And this insult was a coarse ailusion to the white bands which enveloped their legs  Add another resemblance replied an audacious Lombard  you have felt how strongly they kick Visit the plain of Asfield and seek for the bones of thy bro ther they are mingled with those of the vilest animals The Gepidae a nation of warriors started from their seats and the fearless Alboin with his forty compa nions laid their hands on their swords The tumult was appeased by the venera ble interposition of Turisund He saved his own honour and the life of his guest and after the solemn rites of investiture dismissed the stranger in the bloody arms of his sonâ the gift of a weeping parent Alboin returned in triumph and the Lombards who celebrated his matchless intrepidity were compelled to praise the virtues of an enemy 4J In this extraordinary visit he had probably seen the daughter of Cunimund who soon after ascended the throne of the Gepidx Her name was Rosamond an appellation expressive of female beauty and which our own history or romance has consecrated to amorous tales The king of the Lombards the father of Alboin no longer lived was contracted to the grand daugh ter of Clovis but the restraints of faith and policy soon yielded to the hope of pos sessing the fair Rosamond and of insulting her family and nation The arts of per suasion were tried without success and the impatient lover by force and strata 1 Corippus lib iii 390 The unquestionable sense relates to the Turks the conquerors of the Aran birt the word scultar has no apparent meaning and

of the Gepidsc who were sustained by a Roman army And as the offer of mar riage was rejected with contempt Alboin was compelled to relinquish his prey and to partake of th6 disgrace which he had inflicted on the house of Cunimund l When a public quarrel is envenomed by private injuries a blow that is not mor tal or decisive can be productive only of a short truce which allows the unsuccess ful combatant to sharpen his arms for a new encounter The strength of Alboin had been found unequal to the gratification of his love ambition and revenge he condescended to implore the formidable aid of the chagan and the arguments that he employed are expressive of the art and policy of the barbarians In the attack of the Gepidx he had been prompted by the just desire of extirpating a people whom their alliance with the Roman empire had rendered the common enemies of the nations and the personal adversaries of the chagan If the forces of the Avars and the Lombards should unite in this glorious quarrel the victory was secure and the reward inestimable the Danube the Hebrus Italy and Constantinople would be exposed without a barrier to their invincible arms But if they hesitated or delayed to prevent the malice of the Romans the same spirit which had insulted would pursue the Avars to the extremity of the earth These specious reasons were heard by the chagan with coldness and disdain he detained the Lombard ambassadors in his camp protracted the negotiation and by turns alleged his want of inclination or his want of ability to undertake this important enterprise At length he signified the ultimate price of his alliance that the Lombards should im mediately present him with the tithe of their cattle that the spoils and captives should be equally divided but that the lands of the Gepidx should become the sole patrimony of the Avars Such hard conditions were eagerly accepted by the pas sions of Alboin and as the Romans were dissatisfied with the ingratitude and per fidy of the Gepida Justin abandoned that incorrigible people to their fate and re mained the tranquil spectator of this unequal conflict The despair of Cunimund was active and dangerous He was informed that the Avars had entered his con fines but on the strong assurance that after the defeat of the Lombards the fo reign invaders would easily be repelled he rushed forward to encounter the im placable enemy of his name and family But the courage of the Gepidie could se cure them no more than an honourable death The bravest of the nation fell in the field of battle the king of the Lombards contemplated with delight the head of Cunimund and his skull was fashioned into a cup to satiate the hatred of the conqueror or perhaps to comply with the savage custom of his country 2 Af ter this victory no farther obstacle could impede the progress of the confederates and they faithfully executed the terms of their agreement 3 The fair countries of Walachia Moldavia Transylvania and the parts of Hungary beyond the Danube were occupied without resistance by a new colony of Scythians and the Dacian empire of the chagans subsisted with splendour above two hundred and thirty year The nation of the Gepidx was dissolved but in the distribution of the captives the slaves of the Avars were less fortunate than the companions of the Lombards whose generosity adopted a valiant foe and whose freedom was incompatible with cool and deliberate tyranny One moiety of the spoil introduced into the camp of Alboin more wealth than a barbarian could readily compute The fair Rosa mond was persuaded or compelled to acknowledge the rights of her victorious lover and the daughter of Cunimond appeared to forgive those crimes which might be imputed to her own irresistible charms The destruction of a mighty kingdom established the fame of Alboin In the days of Charlemagne the Bavarians the Saxons and the other tribes of the Teutonic language still repeated the songs which described the heroic

richer banks of the Po and the Tiber Fifteen years had not elapsed since his subjects the confederates of Narses had visited the pleasant climate of Italy the mountains the rivers the highways were familiar to their memory the report of their success perhaps the view of their spoils had kin dled in the rising generation the flame of emulation and enterprise Their hopes were encouraged by the spirit and eloquence of Alboin and it is affirmed that bespoke to their senses by producing at the royal feast the fairest and most ex quisite fruits that grew spontaneously in the garden of the world No sooner had he erected his standard than the native strength of the Lombards was multiplied by the adventurous youth of Germany and Scythia The robust peasantry ot No ricum and Pannonia had resumed the manners of barbarians and the names of the Gepidx Bulgarians Sarmatians and Bavarians may be distinctly traced in the provinces of Italy 1 Of the Saxons the old allies of the Lombards twenty thousand warriors with their wives and children accepted the invitation of Al boin Their bravery contributed to his success but the accession or the absence of their numbers was not sensibly felt in the magnitude of his host Every mode of religion was freely practised by its respective votaries The king of the Lom bards had been educated in the Arian heresy but the catholics in their public worship were allowed to pray for his conversion while the more stubborn bar barians sacrificed a she goat or perhaps a captive to the gods of their fathers 2 The Lombards and their confederates were united by their common attachment to a chief who excelled in all the virtues and vices of a savage hero and the vi gilance of Alboin provided an ample magazine of offensive and defensive arms for the use of the expedition The portable wealth of the Lombards attended the march their lands they cheerfully relinquished to the Avars on the solemn pro mise which was made and accepted without a smile that if they failed in the conquest of Italy these voluntary exiles should be reinstated in their former pos sessions They might have failed if Narses had been the antagonist of the Lombards and the veteran warriors the associates of his Gothic victory would have en countered with reluctance an enemy whom they dreaded and esteemed But the weakness of the Byzantine court was subservient to the barbarian cause and it was for the ruin of Italy that the emperor once listened to the complaints of his subjects The virtues of Narses were stained with avarice and in his provin cial reign of fifteen years he accumulated a treasure of gold and silver which sur passed the modesty of a private fortune His government was oppressive or un popular and the general discontent was expressed with freedom by the deputies of Rome Before the throne of Justin they boldly declared that their Gothic servitude had been more tolerable than the despotism of a Greek eunuch and that unless their tyrant were instantly removed they would consult their own happiness in the choice of a master The apprehension of a revolt was urged by the voice of envy and detraction which had so recently triumphed over the me rits of Belisarius A new exarch Longinus was appointed to supersede the con queror of Italy and the base motives of his recall were revealed in the insulting mandate of the empress Sophia  that he should leave to men the exercise of arms and return to his proper station among the maidens of the palace where a distaff should be again placed in the hand of the eunuch  I will spin her such a thread as she shall not easily unravel is said to have been the reply which indignation and conscious virtue extorted from the hero Instead of at tending a slave and a victim at the gate of the Byzantine palace he retired to Naples from whence if any credit is due to the belief of the times Narses in vited the Lombards to chastise the ingratitude of the prince and people 3 But the passions

calamities of nature to the guilt or folly of their rulers 2 Whatever might be the grounds of his security Alboin neither expected nor encountered a Roman army in the field He ascended the Julian Alps and looked down with contempt and desire on the fruitful plains to which his victory communicated the perpetual appellation of Lombakdy A faithful chieftain and a select band were stationed at Forum

and the archbishop with the clergy and nobles of Mi lan were driven by the perfidy of Alboin to seek a refuge in the less accessible ramparts of Genoa Along the maritime coast the courage of the inhabitants was supported by the facility of supply the hopes of relief and the power of es cape but from the Trentine hills to the gates of Ravenna and Rome the inland regions of Italy became without

or piety to interpret this miraculous sign as the wrath of heaven the conqueror paused and relented he sheathed his sword and geacefully reposing himself in the palace of Theodoric proclaimed to the

was splendid and transient and before he could regu late his new conquests Alboin fell a sacrifice to domestic treason and female re venge In a palace near Verona which had not been erected for the barbarians he feasted the companions of his arms intoxication was the reward of valour and the king himself was tempted by appetite or vanity to exceed the ordinary mea sure of his intemperance After draining many capacious bowls of Rhxtian or Falernian wine he called for the skull of Cunipund the noblest and most precious ornament of his sideboard The cup of victory was accepted with horrid applause by the circle of the Lombard chiefs   Fill it again with wine exclaimed the inhuman conqueror fill it to the brim carry this goblet to the queen and request in my name that she would rejoice with her father In an agony of grief and rage Rosamond had strength to utter Let the will of my Lord be obeyed and touching it with her lips pronounced a silent imprecation that the insult should be washed away in the blood of Alboin Some indulgence might be due to the re sentment of a daughter if she had not already violated the duties of a wife Im placable in her enmity or inconstant in her love the queen of Italy had stooped from the throne to the arms of a subject and Helmichis the king s armour bearer was the secret minister of her pleasure and revenge Against the proposal of the murder he could no longer urge the scruples of fidelity or gratitude but Hel michis trembled when he revolved the danger as well as the guilt when he re collected the matchless strength and intrepidity of a warrior whom he had so of ten attended in the field of battle He pressed and obtained that one of the bra vest champions of the Lombards should be associated to the enterprise but no more than a promise of secrecy could be drawn from the gallant Peredeus and the mode of seduction employed by Rosamond betrays her shameless insensibility both to honour and love She supplied the place of one of her female attendants who was beloved by Peredeus and contrived some excuse for darkness and silencey till she could inform her companion that he had enjoyed the queen of the Lom bards and that his own death or the death of Alboin must be the consequence of such treasonable adultery In this alternative he chose rather to be the accomplice than the victim of Rosamond 2 whose Undaunted spirit was incapable of fear or remorse She expected and soon found a favourable moment when the king oppressed with wine had retired from the table to his afternoon slumbers His faithless spouse was anxious for his health and repose the gates of the palace were shut the arms removed the attendants dismissed and Rosamond after lull ing him to rest by her tender caresses unbolted the chamber door and urged the reluctant conspirators to the instant execution of the deed On the first alarm the warrior started from his couch his sword which he attempted to draw had been fastened to the scabbard by the hand of Rosamond and a small stool his only weapon could not long protect him irom the spears of the assassins The daughter of Cuniraund smiled in his fall his body was buried under the staircase of the palace and the grateful posterity of the Lombards revered the tomb and the memory of their victorious leader The ambitious Rosamond aspired to reign in the name of her lover the city and palace of Verona were awed by her power and a faithful band of her native Gepida was prepared to applaud the revenge and to second the wishes of their sovereign But the Lombard chiefs who fled in the first moments of consterna tion and disorder had resumed their courage and collected their powers and the nation instead of submitting to her reign demanded with unanimous cries that justice should be executed on the guilty spouse and the murderers of their king She sought a refuge among the enemies of her country and a criminal who de served the abhorrence of mankind was

Justinian ascended the throne he proclaimed a new era of happiness and glory The annals of a second Justin 2 are marked with disgrace abroad and misery at home In the west the Roman empire was afflicted by the loss of Italy the desolation of Africa and the conquest of the Persians Injus tice prevailed both in the capital and the provinces the rich trembled for their property the poor for their safety the ordinary magistrates were ignorant or ve nal the occasional remedies appear to have been arbitrary and violent and the complaints of the people could no longer be silenced by the splendid names of a legislator and a conqueror The opinion which imputes to the prince all the ca lamities of his times may be countenanced by the historian as a serious truth era salutary prejudice Yet a candid suspicion will arise that the sentiments of Jus tin were pure and benevolent and that he might have filled his station without reproach if the faculties of his mind had not been impaired by disease which de prived the emperor of the use of his feet and confined him to the palace a stran ger to the complaints of the people and the vices of the government The tardy knowledge of his own impotence determined him to lay down the weight of the dia dem and in the choice of a worthy substitute he showed some symptoms of a dis cerning and even magnanimous spirit The only son of Justin and Sophia died in his infancy their daughter Arabia was the wife of Baduarius 3 superintendant of the palace and afterwards commander of the Italian armies who vainly aspired to confirm the rights of marriage by those of adoption While the empire ap peared an object of desire Justin was accustomed to behold with jealousy and ha tred his brothers and cousins the rivals of his hopes nor could he depend on the gratitude of those who would accept the purple as a restitution rather than a gift Of these competitors one had been removed by exile and afterwards by death and the emperor himself had inflicted such cruel insults on another that he must either dread his resentment or despise his patience This domestic animosity was refined into a generous resolution of seeking a successor not in his family but in the republic and the artful Sophia recommended Tiberius 4 his faithful cap tain of the guards whose virtues and fortune the emperor might cherish as the fruit of his judicious choice

was commonly believed that the emperor entertained some thoughts of contracting a double alliance with the rival of his throne The voice of an angel such a fable was propagated might reveal to the emperor that he should always triumph over his domestic foes but Tiberius derived a firmer assurance from the innocence and generosity of his own mind With the odious name of Tiberius he assumed the more popular appellation of Constantine and imitated the purer virtues of the Antonines After recording the vice or folly of so many Roman princes it is pleasant to repose for a moment on a character conspicuous by the qualities of humanity justice temperance and for titude to contemplate a sovereign affable in his palace pious in the church im partial on the seat of judgment and victorious at least by his generals in the Per sian war The most glorious trophy of his victory consisted in a multitude of captives whom Tiberius entertained redeemed and dismissed to their native home with the charitable spirit of a Christian hero The merit or misfortunes of his own subjects had a dearer claim to his beneficence and he measured his boun ty not so much by their expectations as by his own dignity This maxim how ever dangerous in a trustee of the public wealth was balanced by a principle of humanity and justice which taught him to abhor as of the basest alloy the gold that was extracted from the tears of the people For their relief as often as they had suffered by natural or hostile calamities he was impatient to remit the ar rears of the past or the demands of future taxes he sternly rejected the servile offerings of his ministers which were compensated by tenfold oppression and the wise and equitable laws of Tiberius excited the praise and regret of succeed ing times Constantinople believed that the emperor had discovered a treasure but his genuine treasure consisted in the practice of liberal economy and the con tempt of all vain and superfluous expense The Romans of the east would have been happy if the best gift of heaven a patriot king had been confirmed asapro Ser and permanent blessing But in less than four years after the death of Justin is worthy successor sunk into a mortal disease which left him only sufficient time to restore the diadem according to the tenure by which he held it to the most deserving of his fellow citizens He selected Maurice from the crowd a judgment more precious than the purple itself the patriarch and senate were sum moned to the bed of the dying prince he bestowed his daughter and the empire and his last advice was solemnly delivered by the voice of the questor Tiberius expressed his hope that the virtues of his son and successor would erect the no blest mausoleum to his memory His memory was embalmed by the public af fliction but the most sincere grief evaporates in the tumult of a new reign and the eyes and acclamations of mankind were speedily directed to the rising sun The emperor Maurice derived his origin from ancient Rome l but his imme diate parents were settled at Arabissus in Cappadocia and their singular felicity preserved them alive to behold and partake the fortune of their august son The youth of Maurice was spent in the profession of arms Tiberius promoted him to the command of a new and favourite legion of twelve thousand confederates his valour and conduct were signalized in the Persian war and he returned to Con stantinople to accept as his just reward the inheritance of the empire Maurice ascended the throne at the mature age of forty three years and he reigned above twenty years over the east and over himself 2 expelling from his mind the wild democracy of passions and establishing according to the quaint expression of Evagrius a perfect aristocracy of reason and virtue Some suspicions will degrade the testimony of a subject though he protests that his secret praise should never reach the ears of his sovereign 3 and some failings seem to place the character of Maurice below the purer merit of his predecessor His cold and reserved de meanour might be imputed to arrogance his justice was not always exempt from 1 It it therefore singular enough that Paul lib iii c 15 should distinguish him as the first Greek empe rorâ primus ex Greecorum genera in imperio constitutus His immediate predecessors had indeed been bom in the Latin provinces of Europe and a various reading in Grcecorum imperio would apply the expression to the empire rather than the prince 2 Consult for the character and reign of Maurice the fifth and sixth

often exposed him to the reproach of avarice But the rational wishes of an absolute monarch must tend to the happiness of his people Maurice was endowed with sense and courage to promote that happiness and his administration was directed by the prin ciples and example of Tiberius The pusillanimity of the Greeks had introduced so complete a separation between the offices of king and of general that a private soldier who had observed and obtained the purple seldom or never appeared at the head of his armies Yet the emperor Maurice enjoyed the glory of re storing the Persian monarch to his throne his lieutenants waged a doubtful war against the Avars of the Danube and he cast an eye of pity of ineffectual pity t n the abject and distressful state of his Italian provinces From Italy the emperors were incessantly tormented by tales of misery and demands of succours which extorted the humiliating confession of their own weak ness The expiring dignity of Rome was only marked by the freedom and ener gy of her complaints If you are incapable she said of delivering us from the swords of the Lombards save us at least from the calamity of famine Ti berius forgave the reproach and relieved the distress a supply of corn was trans ported from Egypt to the Tiber and the Roman people invoking the name not of Camillus but of St Peter repulsed the barbarians from their walls But the relief was accidental the danger was perpetual and pressing and the clergy and senate collecting the remains of their ancient opulence a sum of three thousand pounds of gold despatched the patrician Pamphronius to lay their gifts and their complaints at the foot of the Byzantine throne The attention of the court and the forces of the east were diverted by the Persian war but the justice of Tiberius applied the subsidy to the defence of the city and he dismissed the patrician with his best advice either to bribe the Lombard chiefs or to purchase the aid of the kings of France Notwithstanding this weak invention Italy was still afflicted Rome was again besieged and the suburb of Classe only three miles from Raven na was pillaged and occupied by the troops of a single duke of Spoleto Maurice gave audience to a second deputation of priests and senators the duties and me naces of religion were forcibly urged in the letters of the Roman pontiff and his nuncio the deacon Gregory was alike qualified to solicit the powers either of heaven or of the earth The emperor adopted with stronger effect the measures of his pre decessor some formidable chiefs were persuaded to embrace the friendship of the Romans and one of them a mild and faithful barbarian lived and died in the ser vice of the exarch the passes of the Alps were delivered to the Franks and the pope encouraged them to violate without scruple their oaths and engagements to the misbelievers Childebert the great grandson of Clovis was persuaded to invade Italy by the payment of fifty thousand pieces but as he had viewed with delight some Byzantine coin of the weight of one pound of gold the king of Aus trasia might stipulate that the gift should be rendered more worthy of his accept ance by a proper mixture of these respectable medals The dukes of the Lom bards had provoked by frequent inroads their powerful neighbours of Gaul As soon as they were apprehensive of a just retaliation they renounced their feeble and disorderly independence the advantages of regal government union secrecy and vigour were unanimously confessed Autharis the son of Clepho had already attained the strength and reputation of a warrior Under the standard of their new king the conquerors of Italy withstood three successive invasions one of which was led by Childebert himself the last of the Merovingian race who de scended from the Alps The first expedition was defeated by the jealous animosi ty of the Franks and Alemanni In the second they were vanquished in a bloody battle with more loss and dishonour than they had sustained since the foundation of their monarchy Impatient for revenge they returned a third time with accu mulated force and Autharis yielded to the fury of the torrent The troops and treasures of the Lombards were distributed in the walled towns between the Alps and the Apennine A nation less sensible of danger than of fatigue and delay soon murmured against the folly of their twenty commanders and the hot vapours of an Italian sun infected with disease those tramontane bodies which had already suffered the vicissitudes of intemperance and famine The powers that were in adequate to the conquest were more than sufficient for the desolation of the coun try nor could the trembling natives distinguish between their enemies and their deliverers If the junction of the Merovingian and imperial forces had been effect ed in the neighbourhood of Milan perhaps they might have subverted the throne ef the Lombards but the Franks expected six days the signal of a flaming village THE DECLINE AND FALL and the arms of the Greeks were idly employed in the reduction of Modena and Parma which were torn from them after the retreat of their transalpine allies The victorious Autharis asserted his claim to the dominion of Italy At the foot of the Rhaetian Alps he subdued the resistance and rifled the hidden treasures of a sequestered island in the lake of Comum At the extreme point of Calabria he touched with his spear a column on the sea shore of Rhegium l proclaiming that ancient land mark to stand the immoveable boundary of his kingdom 2 During a period of two hundred years Italy was unequally divided between the kingdom of the Lombards and the exarchate of Ravenna The offices and pro fessions which the jealousy of Constantine had separated were united by the in dulgence of Justinian and eighteen successive exarchs were invested in the de cline of the empire with the full remains of civil of military and even of ecclesi astical power Their immediate jurisdiction which was afterward consecrated as the patrimony of St Peter extended over the modern Romagna the marshes or valleys of Ferrara and Commachio 3 five maritime cities from Rimini to An cona and a second inland Pentapolis between the Adriatic coast and the hills of the Apennine Three subordinate provinces of Rome of Venice and of Naples which were divided by hostile lands from the palace of Ravenna acknowledged both in peace and war the supremacy of the exarch The duchy of Rome ap pears to have included the Tuscan Sabine and Latin conquests of the first four hundred years of the city and the limits may be distinctly traced along the coast from Civita Vecchia to Tevracina and with the course of the Tiber from Ameria and Narni to the port of Ostia The numerous islands from Grado to Chiozza composed the infant dominion of Venice but the more accessible towns on the con tinent were overthrown by the Lombards who beheld with impotent fury a new capital rising from the waves The power of the dukes of Naples was circum scribed by the bay and the adjacent isles by the hostile territory of Capua and by the Roman colony of Amalphi 4 whose industrious citizens by the invention of the mariner s compass have unveiled the face of the globe The three islands of Sardinia Corsica and Sicily still adhered to the empire and the acquisition of the farther Calabria removed the land mark of Autharis from the shore of Rhegium to the isthmus of Consentia In Sardinia the savage mountaineers preserved the liberty and religion of their ancestors but the husbandmen of Sicily were chained to their rich and cultivated soil Rome was oppressed by the iron sceptre of the exarchs and a Greek perhaps a eunuch insulted with impunity the ruins of the ca pital But Naples soon acquired the privilege of electing her own dukes 5 the inde pendence of Amalphi was the fruit of commerce and the voluntary attachment of Venice was finally ennobled by an equal alliance with the eastern empire On the map of Italy the measure of the exarchate occupies a very inadequate space but it included an ample proportion of wealth industry and population The most faith ful and valuable subjects escaped from the barbarian yoke and the banners of Pa via and Verona of Milan and Padua were displayed in their respective quarters by the new inhabitants of Ravenna The remainder of Italy was possessed by the Lombards and from Pavia the royal seat their kingdom was extended to the east the north and the west as far as the confines of the Avars the Bavarians and the Franks of Austrasia and Burgundv In the language of modern geogra phy it is now represented by the Terra Firma of the Venetian republic Tyrol the Milanese Piedmont the coast of Genoa Mantua Parma and Modena the grand duchy of Tuscany and a large portion of the ecclesiastical state from Peru gia to the Adriatic The dukes and at length the princes of Beneventum sur vived the monarchy and propagated the name of the Lombards From Capua to Tarentum they reigned near five hundred years over the greatest part of the pre sent kingdom of Naples 6 CO The Columns Rhegina in the narrowest part of the Paro of Messina one

geographical question somewhat doubtful and obscure Even Muratori as the servant of the house of Este is not free from partiality and prejudice 4 See Brenchmann Dissert I ma de Republica Amalphitana p

In comparing the proportion of the victorious and the vanquished people the change of language will afford the most probable inference According to this standard it will appear that the Lombards of Italy and the Visigoths of Spain were less numerous than the Franks or Burgundians and the conquerors of Gaul must yield in their turn to the multitude of Saxons and Angles who almost era dicated the idioms of Britain The modem Italian has been insensibly formed by the mixture of nations the awkwardness of the barbarians in the nice manage ment of declensions and conjugations reduced them to the use of articles and auxiliary verbs and many new ideas have been expressed by Teutonic appella tions Yet the principal stock of technical and familiar words is found to be of Latin derivational and if we were sufficiently conversant with the obsolete the rustic and the municipal dialects of ancient Italy we should trace the origin of many terms which might perhaps be rejected by the classic purity of Rome A numerous army constitutes but a small nation and the powers of the Lombards were soon diminished by the retreat of twenty thousand Saxons who scorned a dependant situation and returned after many bold and perilous adventures to their native country 2 The camp of Alboin was of formidable extent but the extent of a camp would be easily circumscribed within the limits of a city and its martial inhabitants must be thinly scattered over the face of a large country When Alboin descended from the Alps he invested his nephew the first duke of Friuli with the command of the province and the people but the prudent Gisulf would have declined the dangerous office unless he had been permitted to choose among the nobles of the Lombards a sufficient number of families 3 to form a perpetual colony of soldiers and subjects In the progress of conquest the same option could not be granted to the dukes of Brescia and Bergamo of Pavia or Tu rin of Spoleto or Beneventum but each of these and each of their colleagues settled in his appointed district with a band of followers who resorted to his standard in war and his tribunal in peace Their attachment was free and ho nourable resigning the gifts and benefits which they had accepted they might emigrate with their families in the jurisdiction of another duke but their absence from the kingdom was punished with death as a crime of military desertion 4 The posterity of the first conquerors struck a deeper root in the soil which by every motive of interest and honour they were bound to defend A Lombard was born the soldier of his king and his duke and the civil assemblies of the na tion displayed the banners and assumed the appellation of a regular army Of this army the pay and the rewards were drawn from the conquered provinces and the distribution which was not effected till after the death of Alboin is dis graced by the foul marks of injustice and rapine Many of the most wealthy Italians were slain or banished the remainder were divided among the strangers and a tributary obligation was imposed under the name of hospitality of paying to the Lombards a third part of the fruits of the earth Within less than seventy vears this artificial system was abolished by a more simple and solid tenure 5 Either the Roman landlord was expelled by his strong and insolent guest or the annual payment a third of the produce was exchanged by a more equitable transaction for an adequate proportion of landed property Under these foreign masters the business of agriculture in the cultivation of corn vines and olives was exercised with degenerate skill and industry by the labour of the slaves and natives But the occupations of a pastoral life were more pleasing to the idleness of the barbarians In the rich meadows of Venetia they restored and improved the breed of horses for which that province had once been illustrious 6 and the Title torn i p 374â 387 has followed the Warned Camillo Pelegrini in the geography

increase of forests affordedtan ample range for the pleasures of the chase 2 That marvellous art which teaches the birds of the air to acknowledge the voice and execute the commands of their master had been unknown to the ingenuity of the Greeks and Romans 3 Scandinavia and Scythia produce the boldest and most tractable falcons 4 they were tamed and educated by the roving inhabitants always on horseback and in the field This favourite amusement of our ancestors was introduced by the barbarians into the Roman provinces and the laws of Italy esteem the sword and the hawk as of equal dignity and importance in the hand of a noble Lombard 5 So rapid was the influence of climate and example that the Lombards of the fourth generation surveyed with curiosity and affright the portraits of their savage forefathers 6 Their heads were shaven behind but the shaggy locks hung over their eyes and mouth and a long beard represented the name and character of the nation Their dress consisted of loose linen garments after the fashion of the Anglo Saxons which were decorated in their opinion with broad stripes of va riegated colours The legs and feet were clothed in long hose and open sandals and even in the security of peace a trusty sword was constantly girt to their side Yet this strange apparel and horrid aspect often concealed a gentle and generous disposition and as soon as the rage of battle had subsided the captives and sub jects were sometimes surprised by the humanity of the victor The vices of the Lombards were the effect of passion of ignorance of intoxication their virtues are the more laudable as they were not affected by the hypocrisy of social manners nor imposed by the rigid constraint of laws and education I should not be ap prehensive of deviating from my subject if it were in my power to delineate the private life of the conquerors of Italy and I shall relate with pleasure the adven turous gallantry of Autharis which breathes the true spirit of chivalry and ro mance 7 After the loss of his promised bride a Merovingian princess he sought in marriage the daughter of the king of Bavaria and the Garibald accepted the alliance of the Italian monarch Impatient of the slow progress of negotiation the ardent lover escaped from his palace and visited the court of Bavaria in the train of his own embassy At the public audience the unknown stranger ad vanced to the throne and informed Garibald that the ambassador was indeed the minister of state but that he alone was the friend of Autharis who had trusted him with the delicate commission of making a faithful report of the charms of his spouse Theudelinda was summoned to undergo this important examination and after a pause of silent rapture he hailed her as queen of Italy and humbly re quested that according to the custom of the nation she would present a cup of wine to the first of her new subjects By the command of her father she obeyed 325 Gisulf obtained from liis uncle gencrosarnm cquarum

ROMAN EMPIRE 167 Autharis received the cup in his turn and in restoring it to the princess he se cretly touched her hand and drew his own finger over his face and lips In the evening Theudelinda imparted to her nurse the indiscreet familiarity of the stranger and was comforted by the assurance that such boldness could proceed only from the king her husband who by his beauty and courage appeared wor thy of her love The ambassadors were dismissed no sooner did they reach the confines of Italy than Autharis raising himself on his horse darted his battle axe against a tree with incomparable strength and dexterity  Such said he to the astonished Bavarians  such are the strokes of the king of the Lombards On the approach of a French army Garibald and his daughter took refuge in the dominions of their ally and the marriage was consummated in the pa lace of Verona At the end of one year it was dissolved by the death of Autharis but the virtues of Theudelinda l had endeared her to the nation and she was permitted to bestow with her hand the sceptre of the Italian kingdom From this fact as well as from similar events 2 it is certain that the Lombards possessed freedom to elect their sovereign and sense to decline the frequent use of that dangerous privilege The public revenue arose from the produce of land and the profits of justice When the independent dukes agreed that Autharis should ascend the throne of his father they endowed the regal office with a fair moiety of their respective domains The proudest nobles aspired to the honours of servitude near the person of their prince he rewarded the fidelity of his vas sals by the precarious gift of pensions and benefices and atoned for the injuries of war by the rich foundation of monasteries and churches In peace a judge a leader in war he never usurped the powers of a sole and absolute legislator The king of Italy convened the national assemblies in the palace or more probably in the fields of Pavia his great council was composed of the persons most emi nent by their birth and dignities but the validity as well as the execution of their decrees depended on the approbation of the faithful people the fortunate army of the Lombards About fourscoreyears after the conquest of Italy their tradi tional customs were transcribed in Teutonic Latin 3 and ratified by the consent of prince and people some new regulations were introduced more suitable to their present condition the example of Rotharis was imitated by the wisest of his suc cessors and the laws of the Lombards have been esteemed the least imperfect of the barbaric codes 4 Secure by their courage in the possession of liberty these rude and hasty legislators were incapable of balancing the powers of the con stitution or of discussing the nice theory of political government Such crimes as threatened the life of the sovereign or the safety of the state were adjudged wor thy of death but their attention was principally confined to the defence of the per son and property of the subject According to the strange jurisprudence of the times the guilt of blood might be redeemed by a fine yet the high price of nine hundred pieces of gold declares a just sense of the value of a simple citizen Less atrocious injuries a wound a fracture a blow an opprobrious word were mea sured with scrupulous and almost ridiculous diligence and the prudence of the le gislator encouraged the ignoble practice of bartering honour and revenge for a pe cuniary compensation The ignorance of the Lombards in the state of pagan ism or Christianity gave implicit credit to the malice and mischief of witchcraft but the judges of the seventeenth century might have been instructed and con founded by the wisdom of Rotharis who derides the absurd superstition and pro tects the wretched victims of popular or judicial cruelty 5 The same spirit of a legislator superior to his age and country may be ascribed to Luitprand who condemns while he tolerates the impious and inveterate abuse of duels 6 obi 1 Giannone Istoria Civile de Napoli torn i p 263 has justly censured the impertinence of Boccaccio Gio 3 Novel 2 who without right or

from his own experience that the juster cause had often been oppressed by successful violence Whatever merit may be discovered in the laws of the Lombards they are the genuine fruit of the reason of the barbarians who never admitted the bishops of Italy to a seat in their legislative councils But the suc cession of their kings is marked with virtue and ability the troubled series of their annals is adorned with fair intervals of peace order and domestic happi ness and the Italians enjoyed a milder and more equitable government than any of the other kingdoms which had been founded on the ruins of the western empire 1 Amidst the arms of the Lombards and under the despotism of the Greeks we again inquire into the fate of Rome 2 which had reached about the close of the sixth century the lowest period of her depression By the removal of the seat of empire and the successive loss of the provinces the sources of public and private opulence were exhausted the lofty tree under whose shade the nations of the earth had reposed was deprived of its leaves and branches and the sapless trunk was left to wither on the ground The ministers of command and the messengers of victory no longer met on the Appian or Flaminian way and the hostile ap proach of the Lombards was often felt and continually feared The inhabitants of a potent and peaceful capital who visit without an anxious thought the garden of the adjacent country will faintly picture in their fancy the distress of the Ro mans they shut or opened their gates with a trembling hand beheld from the walls the flames of their houses and heard the lamentations of their brethren who were coupled together like dogs and dragged away into distant slavery beyond the sea and the mountains Such incessant alarms must annihilate the pleasures and interrupt the labours of a rural life and the Campagna of Rome was speedily reduced to the state of a dreary wilderness in which the land is barren the wa ters are impure and the air is infectious Curiosity and ambition no longer at tracted the nations to the capital of the world but if chance or necessity directed the steps of a wandering stranger he contemplated with horror the vacancy and solitude of the city and might be tempted to ask Where is the senate and where are the people In a season ef excessive rains the Tiber swelled above its banks and rushed with irresistible violence into the valleys of the seven hills A pesti lential disease arose from the stagnation of the deluge and so rapid was the conta gion that fourscore persons expired in an hour in the midst of a solemn procession which implored the mercy of heaven 3 A society in which marriage is encou raged and industry prevails soon repairs the accidental losses of pestilence and war but as the far greater part of the Romans was condemned to hopeless indi gence and celibacy the depopulation was constant and visible and the gloomy en thusiasts might expect the approaching failure of the human race 4 Yet the number of citizens still exceeded the measure of subsistence their precarious food was supplied from the harvests of Sicily or Egypt and the frequent repetition of famine betrays the inattention of the emperor to a distant province The edifices of Rome were exposed to the same ruin and decay the mouldering fabrics were easily overthrown by inundations tempests and earthquakes and the monks who had occupied the most advantageous stations exulted in their base triumph over the ruins of antiquity 5 It is commonly believed that pope Gregory I attacked the temples and mutilated the statues of the city that by the command of the bar barian the Palatine library was reduced to ashes and that the history of Livy was the peculiar mark of his absurd and mischievous fanaticism The writings of Gregory himself reveal his implacable aversion to the monuments of classic genius and he points his severest censure against the profane learning of a bishop who taught the art of grammar studied the Latin poets and pronounced with the same 1 Read he history of Paul Wamefrid particularly lib iii e 16 Baroniui rejects the praise which ap pears to contradict the invectives of pope Gregory the Greek

would have multiplied the copies of Virgil and Livy in the countries which were not subject to the ecclesiastical dictator 1 Like Thebes or Babylon or Carthage the name of Rome might have been erased from the earth if the city had not been animated by a vital principle which again restored her to honour and dominion A vague tradition was embraced that two Jewish teachers a tent maker and a fisherman had formerly been exe cuted In the circus of Nero and at the end of five hundred years their genuine or fictitious relics were adored as the Palladium of Christian Rome The pilgrims of the east and west resorted to the holy threshold but the shrines of the apostles were guarded by miracles and invisible terrors and it was not without fear that the pious catholic approached the object of his worship It was fatal to touch it was dangerous to behold the bodies of the saints and those who from the purest motives presumed to disturb the repose of the sanctuary were affrightened by visions or punished with sudden death The unreasonable request of an empress who wished to deprive the Romans of their sacred treasure the head of St4 Paul was rejected with the deepest abhorrence and the pope asserted most probably with truth that a linen which had been sanctified in the neighbourhood of his body or the filings of his chain which it was sometimes easy and sometimes impossible to obtain possessed an equal degree of miraculous virtue 2 But the power as well as virtue of the apostles resided with living energy in the breasts of their suc cessors and the chair of St Peter was filled under the reign of Maurice by the first and greatest of the name of Gregory 5 His grandfather Felix had himself been pope and as the bishops were already bound by the law of celibacy his con secration must have been preceded by the death of his wife The parents of Gre gory Sylvia and Gordian were the noblest of the senate and the most pious of the church of Rome his female relations were numbered among the saints and virgins and his own figure with those of his father and mother were represented near three hundred years in a family portrait 4 which he offered to the monas tery of St Andrew The design and colouring of this picture afford an honoura ble testimony that the art of painting was cultivated bv the Italians of the sixth century but the most abject ideas must be entertained of their taste and learning since the epistles of Gregory his sermons and his dialogues are the work of a man who was second in erudition to none of his cotemporariesi 5 his birth and

accompanied his retreat rendered him dear and useful to the church and implicit obedience has been always inculcated as the first duty of a monk As soon as he had received the character of deacon Grego ry was sent to reside at the Byzantine court the nuncio or minister of the apostolic see and he boldly assumed in the name of St Peter a tone of independent digni ty which would have been criminal and dangerous in the most illustrious layman of the empire He returned to Rome with a just increase of reputation and after a short exercise of the monastic virtues he was dragged from the cloister to the papal throne by the unanimous voice of the clergy the senate and the people He alone resisted or seemed to resist his own elevation and his humble petition that Maurice would be pleased to reject the choice of the Romans could only serve to exalt his character in the eyes of the emperor and the public When the fatal mandate was proclaimed Gregory solicited the aid of some friendly merchants to convey him in a basket beyond the gates of Rome and modestly concealed him self some days among the woods and mountains till his retreat was discovered as it is said by a celestial light The pontificate of Gregory the Great which lasted thirteen years six months and ten days is one of the most edifying periods of the history of the church His virtues and even his faults a singular mixture of simplicity and cunning of pride and humility of sense and superstition were happily suited to his station and to the temper of the times In his rival the patriarch of Constantinople he con demned the antichristian title of universal bishop which the successor of St Peter was too haughty to concede and too feeble to assume and the ecclesiastical juris diction of Gregory was confined to the triple character of bishop of Rome primate of Italy and apostle of the west He frequently ascended the pulpit and kindled by his rude though pathetic eloquence the congenial passions of his audience the language of the Jewish prophets was interpreted and applied and the minds of the people depressed by their present calamities were directed to the hopes and fears of the invisible wvld His precepts and example defined the model of the Ro man liturgy l the distribution of the parishes the calendar of festivals the or der of processions the service of the priests and deacons the variety and change of sacerdotal garments Till the last days of his life he officiated in the canon of the mass which continued above three hours the Gregorian chant 2 has pre served the vocal and instrumental music of the theatre and the rough voices of the barbarians attempted to imitate the melody of the Roman school 3 Experi ence had shown him the efficacy of these solemn and pompous rites to sooth the distress to confirm the faith to mitigate the fierceness and to dispel the dark en thusiasm of the vulgar and he readily forgave their tendency to promote the reign of priesthood and superstition The bishops of Italy and the adjacent islands ac knowledged the Roman pontiff as their special metropolitan Even the existence the union or the translation of episcopal seats was decided by his absolute discre tion and his successful inroads into the provinces of Greece of Spain and of Gaul might countenance the more lofty pretensions of succeeding popes He interposed to prevent the abuses of popular elections his jealous care maintained the purity of faith and discipline and the apostolic shepherd assiduously watched over the faith and discipline of the subordinate pastors Under his reign the Arians of Ita ly and Spain were reconciled to the catholic church and the conquest of Britain reflects less glory on the name of Csesar than on that of Gregory

him to partake the perils of their spiritual warfare In less than two years he could announce to the archbishop of Alexan dria that they had baptized the king of Kent with ten thousand of his Anglo Sax ons and that the Roman missionaries like those of the primitive church were armed only with spiritual and supernatural powers The credulity or the pru dence of Gregory was always disposed to confirm the truths of religion by the evi dence ef ghosts miracles and resurrectionsj l and posterity has paid to his me mory the same tribute which he freely granted to the virtue of his own or the preceding generation The celestial honours have been liberally bestowed by the authority of the popes but Gregory is the last of their own order whom they have presumed to inscribe in the calendar of saints Their temporal power insensibly arose from the calamities of the times and the Roman bishops who have deluged Europe and Asia with blood were compelled to reign as the ministers of charity and peace I The church of Rome as it has been formerly observed was endowed with ample possessions in Italy Sicily and the more distant provinces and her agents who were frequently subdeacons had acquired a civil and even criminal jurisdiction over their tenants and husband men _ The successor of St Peter administered his patrimony with the temper of a vigilant and moderate landlord 2 and the epistles of Gregory are filled with salutary instructions to abstain from doubtful or vexatious lawsuits to preserve the integrity of weights and measures to grant eveiy reasonable delay and to re duce the capitation of the slaves of the glebe who purchased the right of mar riage by the payment of an arbitrary fine 3 The rent or the produce of these estateswas transported to the mouth of the Tiber at the risk and expense of the pope in the use of wealth he acted like a faithful steward of the church and the poor and liberally applied to their wants the inexhaustible resources of abstinence and order The voluminous account of his receipts and disbursements was kept above three hundred years in the Lateran as the model of Christian economy On the four great festivals he divided their quarterly allowance to the clergy to his domestics to the monasteries the churches the places of burial the alms houses and the hospitals of Rome and the rest of the diocess On the first day of every month he distributed to the poor according to the season their stated portion of corn wine cheese vegetables oil fish fresh provisions clothes and money and his treasures were continually summoned to satisfy in his name the extraordinary demands of indigence and merit The instant distress of the sick and helpless of strangers and pilgrims was relieved by the bounty of each day and of every hour nor would the pontiff indulge himself in a frugal repast till he had sent the dishes from his own table to some objects deserving of his compas sion The misery of the times had reduced the nobles and matrons of Rome to accept without ablush the benevolence of the church three thousand virgins received their food and raiment from the hand of their benefactor and many bishops of Italy escaped from the barbarians to the hospitable threshold of the Vatican Gregory might justly be styled the father of his country and such was the extreme sensibility of his conscience that for the death of a beggar who had perished in the streets he interdicted himself during several days from the exer cise of sacerdotal functions II The misfortunes of Rome involved the apostolic pastor in the business of peace and war and it might be doubtful to himself whether piety or ambition prompted him to supply the place of his absent sovereign Gregory awakened the emperor from a long slumber exposed the guilt or inca pacity of the exarch and his inferior ministers complained that the veterans were withdrawn from Rome for the defence of Spoleto encouraged the Italians to guard their cities and altars and condescended in the crisis of danger to name the tribunes and to direct the operations of the provincial troops But the martial spirit of the pope was checked by the scruples of humanity and religion

pious cowardice of the soldiers who deserted a military for a monastic life If we may credit his own declarations it would have been easy for Gregory to exterminate the Lombards by their domestic factions without leaving a king a duke or a count to save that unfortunate nation from the vengeance of their foes As a Christian bishop he preferred the salutary offices of peace his mediations ap peased the tumult of arms but he was too conscious of the arts of the Greeks and the passions of the Lombards to engage his sacred promise for the obser vance of the truce Disappointed in the hope of a general and lasting treaty he presumed to save his country without the consent of the emperor or the exarch The sword of the enemy was suspended over Rome it was averted by the mild eloquence and seasonable gifts of the pontiff who commanded the respect of he retics and barbarians The merits of Gregory were treated by the Byzantine court with reproach and insult but in the attachment of a

Abyssinia as they suggested a decent pretence to discon tinue the annual tribute which was poorly disguised by the name of pension The churches of Persarmenia were oppressed by the intolerant spirit of the Magi they secretly invoked the protection of the Christians and after the pious murder of their satraps the rebels were allowed and supported as the brethren and subjects of the Roman emperor The complaints of Nushirvan were disregarded by the Byzan tine court Justin yielded to the importunities of the Turks who offered an alliance against the common enemy and the Persian monarchy was threatened at the same instant by the united forces of Europe of Ethiopia and of Scythia At the age of fourscore the sovereign of the east would perhaps have chosen the peaceful enjoyment of his glory and greatness but as soon as war became ine vitable he took the field with the alacrity of youth whilst the aggressor trem bled in the palace of Constantinople Nushirvan or Chosroes conducted in per son the siege of Dara and although that important fortress had been left destitute of troops and magazines the valour of the inhabitants resisted above five months the archers the elephants and the military engines of the great king In the meanwhile his general Adarman advanced from Babylon traversed the desert passed the Euphrates insulted the suburbs of Antioch reduced to ashes the city of Apamea and laid the spoils of Syria at the feet of his master whose perseve rance in the midst of winter at length subverted the bulwark of the east But these losses which astonished the provinces and the court produced a salutary â effect in the repentance and abdication of the emperor Justin a new spirit arose in the Byzantine councils and a truce of three years was obtained by the prudence of Tiberius That seasonable interval was employed in the preparations of war and the voice of rumour proclaimed to the world that from the distant countries of the Alps and the Rhine from Scythia Mxsia Pannonia Illyricum and Isau Tia the strength of the imperial cavalry was re enforced with one hundred and fifty thousand soldiers Yet the king of Persia without fear or without faith re solved to prevent the attack of the enemy again passed the Euphrates and dis missing the ambassadors of Tiberius arrogantly commanded them to await his ar rival at Cxsarea the metropolis of the Cappadocian provinces The two armies encountered each other in the battle of Melitene the barbarians who darkened the air with a cloud of arrows prolonged their line and extended their wings across the plain while the Romans in deep and solid bodies expected to prevail in closer action by the weight of the swords and lances A Scythian chief who commanded their right wing suddenly turned the flank of the enemy attacked their rear guard in the presence of Chosroes penetrated to the midst of the camp pillaged the royal tent profaned the eternal fire loaded a train of camels with the spoils of Asia cut his way through the Persian host and returned with songs of victory to his friends who had consumed the day in single combats or inef fectual skirmishes The darkness of the night and the separation of the Romans afforded the Persian monarch an opportunity of revenge and one of their camps was swept away by a rapid and impetuous assault But the review of his loss and the consciousness of his danger determined Chosroes to a speedy retreat he burnt in his passage the vacant town of Melitene and without consulting the safety of his troops boldly swam the Euphrates on the back of an elephant After this unsuccessful campaign the want of magazines and perhaps some inroad of the Turks obliged him to disband or divide his forces the Romans were left mas ters of the field and their general Justinian

the fertile plains of Assyria the flames of war approached the residence of Nushirvan the indignant monarch sunk into the grave and his last edict restrained his successors from exposing their person in a battle against the Romans Yet the memory of this transient affront was lost in the glo ries of a long reign and his formidable enemies after indulging their dream of conquest again solicited a short respite from the calamities of war 1 The throne of Chosroes Nushirvan was filled by Hormouz or Hormisdas the eldest or the most favoured of his sons With the kingdoms of Persia and India he inherited the reputation and example of his father the service in every rank of his wise and valiant officers and a general system of administration harmo nized by time and political wisdom to promote the happiness of the prince and people But the royal youth enjoyed a still more valuable blessing the friendship of a sage who had presided over his education and who always preferred the ho nour to the interest of his pupil his interest to his inclination In a dispute with the Greek and Indian philosophers Buzurg 2 had once maintained that the most grievous misfortune of life is old age without the remembrance of virtue and our candour will presume that the same principle compelled him during three years to direct the councils of the Persian empire His zeal was rewarded by the gra titude and docility of Hormouz who acknowledged himself more indebted to his preceptor than to his parent but when age and labour had impaired the strength and perhaps the faculties of this prudent counsellor he retired from court and abandoned the youthful monarch to his own passions and those of his favour ites By a fatal vicissitude of human affairs the same scenes were renewed at Ctesiphon which had been exhibited in Rome after the death of Marcus Antoninus The ministers of flattery and corruption who had been banished by the father â were recalled and cherished by the son the disgrace and exile of the friends of Nushirvan established their tyranny and virtue was driven by degrees from the mind of Hormouz from his palace and from the government of the state The faithful agents the eyes and ears of the king informed him of the progress of dis order that the provincial governors flew to their prey with the fierceness of lions and eagles and that their rapine and injustice would teach the most loyal of his subjects to abhor the name and authority of their sovereign The sincerity of this advice was punished with death the murmurs of the cities were despised their tumults were quelled by military execution the intermediate powers between the throne and the people were abolished and the childish vanity of Hormouz who affected the daily use of the tiara was fond of declaring that he alone would be the judge as well as the master of his kingdom In every word and in every ac tion the son of Nushirvan degenerated from the virtues of his father His ava rice defrauded the troops his jealous caprice degraded the satraps the palace the tribunals the waters of the Tigris were stained with the blood of the innocent and the tyrant exulted in the sufferings and execution of thirteen thousand victims As the excuse of his cruelty he sometimes condescended to observe that the fears of the Persians would be productive of hatred and that their hatred must terminate in rebellion but he forgot that his own guilt and folly had inspired the sentiments which he deplored and prepared the event which he so justly appre hended Exasperated by long and hopeless oppression the provinces of Babylon Susa and Carmania erected the standard of revolt and the princes of Arabia India and Scythia refused the customary tribute to the unworthy successor of Nushirvan The arms of the Romans in slow

the quality of dry wood he had the strength and stature of a giant and his savage countenance was fancifully compared to that of a wild cat While the nation trembled while Hormouz disguised his terror by the name of suspicion and his servants concealed their disloyalty under the mask of fear Bahram alone displayed his undaunted courage and apparent fidelity and as soon as he found that no more than twelve thousand soldiers would follow him against the enemy he prudently declared that to this fatal number Heaven had reserved the ho nours of the triumph The steep and narrow descent of the Pule Rudbar 3 or Hyrcanian rock is the only pass through which an army can penetrate into the territory of Rei and the plains of Media From the commanding heights a band of resolute men might overwhelm with stones and darts the myriads of the Turkish host their emperor and his son were transpierced with arrows and the fugitives were left without counsel or provisions to the revenge of an injured people The pa triotism of the Persian general was stimulated by his affection for the city of his fore fathers in the hour of victory every peasant became a soldier and every soldier a hero and their ardour was kindled by the gorgeous spectacle of beds and thrones and tables of massy gold the spoils of Asia and the luxury of the hostile camp A prince of a less malignant temper could not easily have forgotten his benefactor and the secret hatred of Hormouz was envenomed by a malicious report thai Bahram had privately retained the most precious fruits of his Turkish victory But the approach of a Roman army on the side of the Araxes compelled the im placable tyrant to smile and to applaud and the toils of Bahram were rewarded with the permission of encountering a new enemy by their skill and discipline more formidable than a Scythian multitude Elated by his recent success he despatched a herald with a bold defiance to the camp of the Romans requesting them to fix a day of battle and to choose whether they would pass the river them selves or allow a free passage to the arms of the great king The lieutenant of the emperor Maurice preferred the safer alternative and this local circum stance which would have enhanced the victory of the Persians rendered their de feat more bloody and their escape more difficult But the loss of his subjects and the danger of his kingdom were overbalanced in the mind of Hormouz by the disgrace of his personal enemy and no sooner had Bahram collected and re viewed his forces than he received from a royal messenger the insulting gift of a

the soldiers in this unworthy disguise they resented his ignominy and their own a shout of rebellion ran through the ranks and the general accepted their oaths of fidelity and vows of revenge A second messenger who had been commanded to bring the rebel in chains was trampled under the feet of an elephant and manifestoes were diligently circula ted exhorting the Persians to assert their freedom against an odious and con temptible tyrant The defection was rapid and universal his loyal slaves were sacrificed to the public fury the troops deserted to the standard of Bahram and the provinces again saluted the deliverer of his country â As the passes were faithfully guarded Hormouz could only compute the number of his enemies by the testimony of a guilty conscience and the daily defection of those who in the hour of his distress avenged their wrongs or forgot their obli gations He proudly displayed the ensigns of royalty but the city and palace of Modain had already escaped from the hand of the tyrant Among the victims of his cruelty Bindoes a Sassanian prince had been cast into a dungeon his fetters were broken by the zeal and courage of a brother and he stood before the king at the head of those trusty guards who had been chosen as the ministers of his con finement and perhaps of his death Alarmed by the hasty intrusion and bold re proaces of the captive Hormouz looked round but in vain for advice or assist ance discovered that his strength consisted in the obedience of others and pa tiently yielded to the single arm of Bindoes who dragged him from the throne to the same dungeon in which he himself had been so lately confined At the first tumult Chosroes the eldest of the sons of Hormouz escaped from the city he â was persauded to return by the pressing and friendly invitation of Bindoes who promised to seat him on his father s throne and who expected to reign under the name of an inexperienced youth In the just assurance that his accomplices could neither forgive nor hope to be forgiven and that every Persian might be trusted as the judge and enemy of the tyrant he instituted a public trial without a copy in the annals of the east The son of Nushirvan who had requested to plead in his own defence was introduced as a criminal into the full assembly of the nobles and satraps 1 He was heard with decent attention as long as he ex patiated on the advantages of order and obedience the danger of innovation and the inevitable discord of those who had encouraged each other to trample on their lawful and hereditary sovereign By a pathetic appeal to their humanity he ex torted that pity which is seldom refused to the fallen fortunes of a king and while they beheld the abject posture and squalid appearance of the prisoner his tears his chains and the marks of ignominious stripes it was impossible to forget how recently they had adored the divine splendour of his diadem and purple But an angry murmur arose in the assembly as soon as he presumed to vindicate his con duct and to applaud the victories of his reign He defined the duties of a king and the Persian nobles listened with a smile of contempt they were fired with in dignation when he dared to vilify the character of Chosroes and by the indiscreet offer of resigning the sceptre to the second of his sons he subscribed his own con demnation and sacrificed the life of his innocent favourite The mangled bodies of the boy and his mother were exposed to the people the eyes of Hormouz were pierced with a hot needle and the punishment of the father was succeeded by the coronation of his eldest son Chosroes had ascended the throne without guilt and his piety strove to alleviate the misery of the abdicated monarch from the dungeon he removed Hormouz to an apartment of the palace supplied with liber ality the consolations of sensual enjoyment and patiently endured the furious sal lies of his resentment and despair He might despise the resentment of a blind and unpopular tyrant but the tiara was trembling on his head till he could sub vert the power or acquire the friendship of the great Bahram who sternly de nied the justice of a revolution in which himself and his soldiers the true repre sentatives of Persia had never been consulted The offer of a general amnesty and of the second rank in his kingdom was answered by an epistle from Bahram friend of the gods conqueror of men and enemy of tyrants the satrap of satraps general of the Persian armies and a prince adorned with the title of eleven vh tues 2 He commands Chosroes the son of Hormouz to shun the example and 1

from his gracious benefactor the pardon of his faults and the government of a pro vince The rebel might not be proud and the king most assuredly was not hum ble but the one was conscious of his strength and the other was sensible of his weakness and even the modest language of his reply still left room for treaty and reconciliation Chosroes led into the field the slaves of the palace and the popu lace of the capital they beheld with terror the banners of a veteran army they were encompassed and surprised by the evolutions of the general and the satraps who had deposed Hormouz received the punishment of their revolt or expiated their first treason by a second and more criminal act of disloyalty The life and liberty of Chosroes were saved but he was reduced to the necessity of imploring aid or refuge in some foreign land and the implacable Bindoes anxious to secure an unquestionable title hastily returned to the palace and ended with a bow string the wretched existence of the son of Nushirvan l While Chosroes despatched the preparations of his retreat he deliberated with his remaining friends 2 whether he should lurk in the valleys of mount Cauca sus or fly to the tents of the Turks or solicit the protection of the emperor The long emulation of the successors of Artaxerxes and Constantine increased his re luctance to appear as a suppliant in a rival court but he weighed the forces of the Romans and prudently considered that the neighbourhood of Syria would render his escape more easy and the more effectual Attended only by his concubines and a troop of thirty guards he secretly departed from the capital followed the banks of the Euphrates traversed the desert and hatted at the distance of ten miles from Circesium About the third watch of the night the Roman prefect was informed of his approach and he introduced the royal stranger to the fortress at the dawn of day From thence the king of Persia was conducted to the more honourable residence of Hierapolis and Maurice dissembled his pride and dis played his benevolence at the reception of the letters and ambassadors of the grandson of Nushirvan They humbly represented the vicissitudes of fortune and the common interest of princes exaggerated the ingratitude of Bahram the agent of the evil principle and urged with specious argument that it was for the ad vantage of the Romans themselves to support the two monarchies which balance the world the two great luminaries by whose salutary influence it is vivified and adorned The anxiety of Chosroes was soon relieved by the assurance that the emperor had espoused the cause of justice and royalty but Maurice prudently de clined the expense and delay of his useless visit to Constantinople In the name of his generous benefactor a rich diadem was presented to the fugitive prince with an inestimable gift of jewels and gold a powerful army was assembled on the frontiers of Syria and Armenia under the command of the valiant and faithful Narses 3 and this general of his own nation and his own choice was directed to pass the Tigris and never to sheathe his sword till he had restored Chos roes to the throne of his ancestors The enterprise however splendid was less arduous than it might appear Persia had already repented of her fatal rash ness which betrayed the heir of the house of Sassantothe ambition of a rebellious subject and the bold refusal of the Magi to consecrate his usurpation compelled Bahram to assume the sceptre regardless of the laws and prejudices of the nation The palace was soon distracted with conspiracy the city with tumult the pro vinces with insurrection and the cruel execution of the guilty and the suspected served to irritate rather than subdue the public discontent No sooner did the grandson of Nushirvan display his own and the Roman banners beyond the Ti gris than he was joined each day by the increasing multitudes of the nobility and people and as he advanced he received from every side the grateful

inhabitants obeyed the first summons of Mebodes at the head of only two thousand horse and Chosroes ac cepted the sacred and precious ornaments of the palace as the pledge of their truth and a presage of his approaching success After the junction of the impe rial troops which Bahram vainly struggled to prevent the contest was decided by two battles on the banks of the Zab and the confines of Media The Romans with the faithful subjects of Persia amounted to sixty thousand while the whole force of the usurper did not exceed forty thousand men the two generals signa lized their valour and ability but the victory was finally determined by the pre valence of numbers and discipline With the remnant of a broken army Bah ram fled towards the eastern provinces of the Oxus the enmity of Persia recon ciled him to the Turks but his days were shortened by poison perhaps the most incurable of poisons the stings of remorse and despair and the bitter remembrance of lost glory Yet the modern Persians still commemorate the exploits of Bahram and some excellent laws have prolonged the duration of his troubled and ti ansi tory reign The restoration of Chosroes was celebrated with feasts and executions and the music of the royal banquet was often disturbed by the groans of dying or mutilated criminals A general pardon might have diffused comfort and tranquillity through a country which had been shaken by the late revolutions yet before the sangui nary temper of Chosroes is blamed we should learn whether the Persians had not been accustomed either to dread the rigour or to despise the weakness of their sovereign The revolt of Bahram and the conspiracy of the satraps were impar tially punished by the revenge or justice of the conqueror the merits of Bindoes himself could not purify his hand from the guilt of royal blood and the son of Hor mouz was desirous to assert his own innocence and to vindicate the sanctity of kings During the vigour of the Roman power several princes were seated on the throne of Persia by the arms and the authority of the first Cassars But their new subjects were soon disgusted with the vices or virtues which they had imbibed in a foreign land the instability of their dominion gave birth to a vulgar observation that the choice of Rome was solicited and rejected with equal ardour by the capri eious levity of oriental slaves Â 1 But the glory of Maurice was conspicuous in the long and fortunate reign of his son and his ally A band of a thousand Romans who continued to guard the person of Chosroes proclaimed its confidence in the fidelity of the strangers his growing strength enabled him to dismiss his unpopular aid but he steadily professed the same gratitude and reverence to bis adopted fa ther and till the death of Maurice the peace and alliance of the two empires were faithfully maintained Yet the mercenary friendship of the Roman prince had been purchased with costly and important gifts the strong cities of Martyropolis and Dara were restored and the Persarmenians became the willing subjects of an empire whose eastern limit was extended beyond the example of her former times as far as the banks of the Araxes and the neighbourhood of the Caspian A pious hope was indulged that the church as well as the state might triumph in this revolution but if Chosroes had sincerely listened to the Christian bishops the impression was erased by the zeal and eloquence of the Magi if he was armed with philosophic indifference he accommodated his belief or rather his profes sions to the various circumstances of an exile and a sovereign The imaginary conversion of the king of Persia was reduced to a local and superstitious veneration for Sergius 2 one of the saints of Antioch who heard his prayers and

dominion from the foot of the Alps to the sea coast of the Euxine The reign of Baian is the brightest era of their monarchy their chagan who occupied the rustic palace of Attila appears to have imitated his character and policy 3 but as the same scenes were repeated in a smaller cir cle a minute representation of the copy would be devoid of the greatness and no velty of the original The pride of the second Justin of Tiberius and Maurice was humbled by a proud barbarian more prompt to inflict than exposed to suffer the injuries of war and as often as Asia was threatened by the Persian arms Eu rope was oppressed by the dangerous inroads or costly friendship of the Avars When the Roman envoys approached the presence of the chagan they were commanded to wait at the door of his tent till at the end perhaps of ten or twelve days he condescended to admit thera If the substance or the style of their mes sage was offensive to his ear he insulted with a real or affected fury their own dignity and that of their prince their baggage was plundered and their lives were only saved by the promise of a richer present and a more respectful address But his sacred ambassadors enjoyed and abused an unbounded license in the midst of Constantinople they urged with importunate clamours the increase of tribute or the restitution of captives and deserters and the majesty of the empire was al most equally degraded by a base compliance or by the false and fearful excuses with which they eluded such insolent demands The chagan had never seen an elephant and his curiosity was excited by the strange and perhaps fabulous por trait of that wonderful animal At his command one of the largest elephants of the imperial stables was equipped with stately caparisons and conducted by a numerous train to the royal village in the plains of Hungary He surveyed the enormous beast with surprise with disgust and possibly with terror and smiled at the vain industry of the Romans who in search of such useless rarities could explore the limits of the land and sea He wished at the expense of the emperor to repose in a golden bed The wealth of Constantinople and the skilful diligence of her artists were instantly devoted to the gratification of his caprice but when the work was finished he rejected with scorn a present so unworthy the majesty of a great king 4 These were the casual sallies of his pride but the avarice of the chagan was a more steady and tractable passion a rich and regular supply of silk apparel furniture and plate introduced the rudiments of art and luxury

yet he was not inferior to the most civilized nations in the refinements of dissimu lation and perfidy As the successor of the Lombards the chagan asserted his claim to the important city of Sirmium the ancient bulwark of the Illyrian pro vinces 2 The plains of the Lower Hungary were covered with the Avar horse and a fleet of large boats was built in the Hyrcinian wood to descend the Danube and to transport into the Save the materials of a bridge But as the strong garri son of Singidunum which commanded the conflux ot the two rivers might have stopped their passage and baffled his designs he dispelled their apprehensions by a solemn oath that his views were not hostile to the empire He swore by his sword the symbol of the god of war that he did not as the enemy of Rome con struct a bridge

the forests and mountains bury us in their ruins and the Save returning against the laws of nature to his source overwhelm us in his angry waters After this barbarous imprecation he calmly inquired what oath was the most sacred and venerable among the Christians what guilt of perjury it was most dangerous to incur _ The bishop of Singidunum presented the gospel which the chagan received with de vout reverence  I swear said he  by the God who has spoken in this holy book that I have neither falsehood on my tongue nor treachery in my heart As  soon as he rose from his knees he accelerated the labour of the bridge and des patched an envoy to proclaim what he no longer wished to conceal  Inform the emperor said the perfidious Baian  that Sirmium is invested on every side Advise his prudence to withdraw the citizens and their effects and resign a city which it is now impossible to relieve or defend Without the hope of relief the defence of Sirmium was prolonged above three years the walls were still un touched but famine was enclosed within the walls till a merciful capitulation al lowed the escape of the naked and hungry inhabitants Singidunum at the dis tance of fifty miles experienced a more cruel fate the buildings were rased and the vanquished people were condemned to servitude and exile Yet the ruins of Sirmium are no longer visible the advantageous situation of Singidunum soon at tracted a new colony of Sclavonians and the conflux of the Save and Danube is still guarded by the fortifications of Belgrade or the White City so often and so obstinately disputed by the Christian and Turkish arms 3 From Belgrade to the walls of Constantinople a line may be measured of six hundred miles that line was marked with flames and with blood the horses of the Avars were alter nately bathed in the Euxine and the Adriatic and the Roman pontiff alarmed by the approach of a more savage enemy 4 was reduced to cherish the Lombards as the protectors of Italy The despair of a captive whom his country refused to ransom disclosed to the Avarsthe intention and practice of military engines 5 but in the first attempts they were rudely framed and awkwardly managed and the resistance of Diocletianapolis and Bersea of Phillippolis and Adrianople soon exhausted the skill and patience of the besiegers The warfare of Baian was that of a Tartar yet his mind was

of Silesia In the disposition both of his troops and provinces the chagan exposed the vassals whose lives he disregarded 2 to the first assault and the swords of the enemy were blunted before they encountered the native valour of the Avars The Persian alliance restored the troops of the east to the defence of Europe and Maurice who had supported ten years the insolence of the chagan declared his resolution to march in person against the barbarians In the space of two centuries none of the successors of Theodosius had appeared in the field their lives were supinely spent in the palace of Constantinople and the Greeks could no longer understand that the name of emfieror in its primitive sense denoted the chief of the armies of the republic The martial ardour of Maurice was op posed by the grave flattery of the senate the timid superstition of the patriarch and the tears of the empress Constantina and they all conjured him to devolve on some meaner general the fatigues and perils of a Scythian campaign Deaf to their advice and entreaty the emperor boldly advanced 3 seven miles from the capital the sacred ensign of the cross was displayed in the front and Maurice re viewed with conscious pride the arms and numbers of the veterans who had fought and conquered beyond the Tigris Anchialus saw the last term of his pro gress by sea and land he solicited without success a miraculous answer to his nocturnal prayers his mind was copfounded by the death of a favourite horse the encounter of a wild boar a storm of wind and rain and the birth of a monstrous child and he forgot that the best omen is to unsheathe our sword in the defence of our country 4 Under the pretence of receiving the ambassadors of Persia the emperor returned to Constantinople exchanged the thoughts of war for those of devotion and disappointed the public hope by his absence and the choice of his lieutenants The blind partiality of fraternal love might excuse the promotion of his brother Peter who fled with equal disgrace from the barbarians from his own soldiers and from the inhabitants of a Roman city That city if we may credit the resemblance of name and character was the famous Azimuntium 5 which had alone repelled the tempest of Attila The example of her warlike youth was propagated to succeeding generations and they obtained from the first or the second Justin an honourable privilege that their valour should be always re served for the defence of their native country The brother of Maurice attempted to violate this privilege and to mingle a patriot band with the mercenaries of his camp they retired to the church he was not awed by the sanctity of the place the people rose in their cause the gates were shut the ramparts were manned and the cowardice of Peter was found equal to his arrogance and injustice The military fame of Commentiolus 6 is the object of satire or comedy rather than of serious history since he was even deficient in the vile and vulgar qualification of personal courage His solemn councils strange evolutions and secret orders always supplied an apology for flight or delay If he marched against the enemy the pleasant valleys of

winter season A prince who could promote and support this unworthy favourite must derive no glory from the accidental merit of his colleague Priscus l In five successive battles which seem to have been conducted with skill and resolution seventeen thousand two hundred barbarians were made prisoners near sixty thousand with four sons of the chagan were slain the Roman general surprised a peaceful dis trict of the Gepidi who slept under the protection of the Avars and his last tro phies were erected on the banks of the Danube and the Teyss Since the death of Trajan the arms of the empire had not penetrated so deeply into the old Da cia yet the success of Priscus was transient and barren and he was soon recalled by the apprehension that Baian with dauntless spirit and recruited forces was preparing to avenge his defeat under the walls of Constantinople 2 The theory of war was not more familiar to the camps of Csesar and Trajan than to those of Justinian and Maurice 3 The iron ot Tuscany or Pontus still received the keenest temper from the skill of the Byzantine workmen The magazines were plentifully stored with every species of offensive and defensive arms In the construction and use of ships engines and fortifications the barba rians admire the superior ingenuity of a people whom they had so often vanquished in the field The science of tactics the order evolutions and stratagems of an tiquity were transcribed and studied in the books of the Greeks and Romans But the solitude or degeneracy of the provinces could no longer supply a race of men to handle those weapons to guard those walls to navigate those ships and to reduce the theory of war into bold and successful practice The genius of Be lisarius and Narses had been formed without a master and expired without a disciple Neither honour nor patriotism nor generous superstition could ani mate the lifeless bodies of slaves and strangers who had succeeded to the honours of the legions it was in the camp alone that the emperor should have exercised a despotic command it was only in the camps that his authority was disobeyed and in sulted he appeased and inflamed with gold the licentiousness of the troops but their vices were inherent their victories were accidental and their costly main tenance exhausted the substance of a state which they were unable to defend After a long and pernicious indulgence the cure of this inveterate evil was under taken by Maurice but the rash attempt which drew destruction on his own head tended only to aggravate the disease A reformer should be exempt from the suspicion of interest and he must possess the confidence and esteem of those whom he proposes to reclaim The troops of Maurice might listen to the voice of a victorious leader they disdained the admonitions of statesmen and sophists and when they received an edict which deducted from their pay the price of their arms and clothing they execrated the avarice of a prince insensible of the dan gers and fatigues from which he had escaped The camps both of Asia and Eu rope were agitated with frequent and funous seditions 4 the enraged soldiers of Edessa pursued with reproaches with threats with wounds their trembling ge nerals they overturned the statues of the emperor cast stones against the mira culous image of Christ and either rejected the yoke of all civil and military laws or instituted a dangerous model of voluntary subordination The monarch al ways distant and often deceived was incapable of yielding or persisting according to the exigence of the moment But the fear of a general revolt induced him too readily to accept any act of valour or any expression of loyalty as an atonement for the popular offence the new reform was abolished as hastily as it had been an nounced and the troops instead of punishment and restraint were agreeably sur prised by a gracious proclamation of immunities and rewards But the soldiers accepted without gratitude the tardy and reluctant gifts of the emperor their in solence was elated by the discovery of his weakness and their own strength and their mutual hatred was inflamed beyond the desire of forgiveness or the hope of reconciliation The historians of the times adopt the vulgar suspicion that Mau 1 See the exploits of Priscus Kb viii c 2 3 t 2 The general detail of the war against the

expelled or slaughtered his faithful adherents and under the command of Phocas a simple centurion returned by hasty marches to the neighbourhood of Constantinople After a long series of legal succession the mi litary disorders of the third century were again revived yet such was the novelty of the enterprise that the insurgents were awed by their own rashness They hesitated to invest their favourite with the vacant purple and while they rejected all treaty with Maurice himself they held a friendly correspondence with his son Theodosius and with Germanus the father in law of the royal youth So ob scure had been the former condition of Phocas that the emperor was quite igno rant of the name and character of his rival but as soon as he learned that the centurion though bold in sedition was timid in the face of danger Alas cried the desponding prince if he is a coward he will surely be a murderer Yet if Constantinople had been firm and faithful the murderer might have spent his fury against the walls and the rebel army would have been gradually consumed or reconciled by the prudence of the emperor In the games of the circus which he repeated with unusual pomp Maurice disguised with smiles of confidence the anxiety of his heart condescended to solicit the applause of the factions and flattered their pride by accepting from their respective tribunes a list of nine hundred blues and fifteen hundred greens whom he affected to esteem his weakness and hastened his fall the green faction were the secret accomplices of the rebels and the blues recommended lenity and moderation in a contest with their Roman brethren The rigid and parsimonious virtues of Maurice had long since alienated the hearts of his subjects as he walked barefoot in a religious pro cession he was rudely assaulted with stones and his guards were compelled to present their iron maces inthe defence of his person A fanatic monk ran through the streets with a drawn sword denouncing against him the wrath and the sen tence of God and a vile plebeian who represented his countenance and apparel was seated on an ass and pursued by the imprecations of the multitude 2 The emperor suspected the popularity of Germanus with the soldiers and citizens he feared he threatened but he delayed to strike the patrician fled to the sanctuary of the church the people rose in his defence the walls were deserted by the guards and the lawless city was abandoned to the flames and rapine of a noctur nal tumult In a small bark the unfortunate Maurice with his wife and nine children escaped to the Asiatic shore but the violence of the wind compelled him to land at the church of St Autonomus 3 near Chalcedon from whence he despatched Theodosius his eldest son to implore the gratitude and friendship of the Persian monarch For himself he refused to fly his body was tortured with sciatic pains 4 his mind was enfeebled by superstition he patiently awaited the event of the revolution and addressed a fervent and public prayer to the Almighty that the punishment of his sins might be inflicted in this world rather than in 3 future life After the abdication of Maurice the two factions disputed the

hurried along by the crowds who rushed to the palace of Hebdomon seven miles from the city to adore the ma jesty of Phocas the centurion A modest wish of resigning the purple to the rank and merit of Germanus was opposed by his resolution more obstinate and equally sincere the senate and clergy obeyed his summons and as soon as the patriarch was assured of his orthodox belief he consecrated the successful usurper in the church of St John the Baptist On the third day amidst the acclamations of a thoughtless people Phocas made his public entry in a chariot drawn by four white horses the revolt of the troops was rewarded by a lavish donative and the new sovereign after visiting the palace beheld from his throne the games of the hip podrome In a dispute of precedency between the two factions his partial judg ment inclined in favour of the greens Remember that Maurice is still alive re sounded from the opposite side and the indiscreet clamour of the blues admonished and stimulated the cruelty of the tyrant The ministers of death were des patched to Chalcedon they dragged the emperor from his sanctuary and the live sons of Maurice were successively murdered before the eyes of their agonizing parent At each stroke which he felt in his heart he found strength to rehearse a pious ejaculation â Thou art just O Lord and thy judgments are righteous And such in the last moments was his rigid attachment to truth and justice that he revealed to the soldiers the pious falsehood of a nurse who presented her own child in the place of a royal infant 1 The tragic scene was finally closed by the execution of the emperor himself in the twentieth year of his reign and the sixty third year of his age The bodies of the father and his five sons were cast into the sea their heads were exposed at Constantinople to the insults or pity of the multitude and it was not till some signs of putrefaction had appeared that Pho cas connived at the private burial of these venerable remains In that grave the faults and errors of Maurice were kindly interred His fate alone was remem bered and at the end of twenty years in the recital of the history of Theophylact the mournful tale was interrupted by the tears of the audience 2 Such tears must have flowed in secret and such compassion would have been criminal under the reign of Phocas who was peaceably acknowledged in the provinces of the east and west The images of the emperor and his wife Leontia were exposed in the Lateran to the veneration of the clergy and senate of Rome and afterwards deposited in the palace of the Csesars between those of Constan tine and Theodosius As a subject and a Christian it was the duty of Gregory to acquiesce in the established government but the joyful applause with which he salutes the fortune of the assassin has sullied with indelible disgrace the charac ter of the saint The successor of the apostles might have inculcated with de cent firmness the guilt of blood and the necessity of repentance he is content to celebrate the deliverance of the people and the fall of the oppressor to rejoice that the piety and benignity of Phocas have been raised by Providence to the im perial throne to pray that his hands may be strengthened against all his enemies and to express a wish perhaps a prophecy that after a long and triumphant reign he maybe transferred from a temporal to an everlasting kingdom 3 I have already traced the steps of a revolution so pleasing in Gregory s opinion both to heaven and earth and Phocas does not appear less hateful in the exercise than in the acquisition of power The pencil of an impartial historian has delineated the portrait of a monster 4 his diminutive and deformed person the closeness of his shaggy eve brows his red hair his beardless chin and his cheek disfigured and discoloured by a formidable scar Ignorant of letters of laws and even of arms he indulged in the supreme rank a more ample privilege of lust and drunk enness and his brutal pleasures were either injurious to his subjects or disgraceful 1 From this generous attempt Corneille has deduced the intricate web of his tragedy of Heraclius which requires more than one

Persian court had been intercepted by a rapid pursuit or a deceitful message he was beheaded at Nice and the last hours of the young prince were soothed by the comforts of religion and the consciousness of innocence Yet his phantom dis turbed the repose of the usurper a whisper was circulated through the east that the son of Maurice was still alive the people expected their avenger and the widow and daughter of the late emperor would have adopted as their son and brother the vilest of mankind In the massacre of the imperial family l the mercy or rather the discretion of Phocas had spared these unhappy females and they were decently confined to a private house But the spirit of the empress Constantina still mindful of her father her husband and her sons aspired to freedom and revenge At the dead of the night she escaped to the sanctuary of St Sophia but her tears and the gold of her associate Germanus were insuffi cient to provoke an insurrection Her life was forfeited to revenge and even to justice but the patriarch obtained and pledged an oath for her safety a monastery was allotted for her prison and the widow of Maurice accepted and abused the le nity of his assassin The discovery or the suspicion of a second conspiracy dis solved the engagements and rekindled the fury of Phocas A matron who com manded the respect and pity of mankind the daughter wife and mother of em perors was tortured like the vilest malefactor to force a confession of her designs and associates and the empress Constantina with three innocent daughters was beheaded at Chalcedon on the same ground which had been stained with the blood of her husband and five sons After such an example it would be super fluous to enumerate the names and sufferings of meaner victims Their condem nation was seldom preceded by the forms of trial and their punishment was im bittered by the refinements of cruelty their eyes were pierced their tongues were torn from the root their hands and teet were amputated some expired under the lash others in the flames others again were transfixed with arrows and a simple speedy death was mercy which they could rarely obtain The hippodrome the sacred asylum of the pleasures and the liberty of the Romans was polluted with heads and limbs and mangled bodies and the companions of Phocas were the most sensible that neither his favour nor their services could protect them from a tyrant the worthy rival of the Caligulas and Domitians of the first age of the empire 2 A daughter of Phocas his only child was given in marriage to the patrician Crispus 3 and the royal images of the bride and bridegroom were indiscreetly placed in the circus by the side of the emperor The father must desire that his posterity should inherit the fruit of his crimes but the monarch was offended by this premature and popular association the tribunes of the green faction who ac cused the officious error of their sculptors were condemned to instant death their lives were granted to the prayers of the people but Crispus might reasonably doubt whether a jealous usurper could forget and pardon his involuntary compe tition The green faction was alienated by the ingratitude of Phocas and the loss of their privileges every province of the empire was ripe for rebellion and He raclius exarch of Africa persisted above two years in refusing all tribute and obedience to the centurion who disgraced the throne of Constantinople By the secret emissaries of Crispus and the senate the independent exarch was solicited to save and to govern his country but his

their undertaking was conveyed to the ears of Phocas and the wife and mother of the young Heraclius were secured as hostages of his faith but the treacherous art of Crispus extenuated the distant peril the means of defence were neglected or delayed and the tyrant supinely slept till the African navy cast anchor in the Hellespont Their standard was joined at Abidus by the fugitives and exiles who thirsted for revenge the ships of Heraclius whose lofty masts were adorned with the holy symbols of religion l steered their triumphant course through the Propontis and Phocas beheld from the windows of the palace his ap proaching and inevitable fate The green faction was tempted by gifts and pro mises to oppose a feeble and fruitless resistance to the landing of the Africans but the people and even the guards were determined by the well timed defec tion of Crispus and the tyrant was seized by a private enemy who boldly invaded the solitude of the palace Stripped of the diadem and purple clothed in a vile habit and loaded with chains he was transported in a small boat to the imperial galley of Heraclius who reproached him with the crimes of his abominable reign  Wilt thou govern better were the last words of the despair of Phocas Af ter suffering each variety of insult and torture his head was severed from his body the mangled trunk was cast into the flames and the same treatment was in flicted on the statues of the vain usurper and the seditious banner of the green faction The voice of the clergy the senate and the people invited Heraclius to ascend the throne which he had purified from guilt and ignominy after some graceful hesitation he yielded to their entreaties His coronation was accompa nied by that of his wife Eudoxia and their posterity till the fourth generation continued to reign over the empire of the east The voyage of Heraclius had been easy and prosperous the tedious march of Nicetas was not accomplished be fore the decision of the contest but he submitted without a murmur to the fortune of his friend and his laudable intentions were rewarded with an equestrian statue and a daughter of the emperor It was more difficult to trust the fidelity of Cris pus whose recent services were recompensed by the command of the Cappapo cian army His arrogance soon provoked and seemed to excuse the ingratitude of his new sovereign In the presence of the senate the son in law of Phocas was condemned to embrace the monastic life and the sentence was justified by the weighty observation of Heraclius that the man who had betrayed his father could never be faithful to his friend 2 Even after his death the public was afflicted by the crimes of Phocas which armed with a pious cause the most formidable of her enemies According to the friendly and equal forms of the Byzantine and Persian courts he announced his exaltation to the throne and his ambassador Lilius who had presented him with the heads of Maurice and his sons was the best qualified to describe the circum stances of the tragic scene 3 However it might be varnished by fiction or sophistry Chosroes turned with horror from the assassin imprisoned the pre tended envoy disclaimed the usurper and declared himself the avenger of his father and benefactor The sentiments of grief and resentment which humanity would feel and honour would dictate promoted on this occasion the interest of the Persian king and his interest was powerfully magnified by the national and religious prejudices of the magi and satraps In a strain of artful adulation which assumed the language of freedom they presumed to censure the excess of his gratitude and friendship for the Greeks a nation with whom it was dangerous to conclude either peace or alliance whose superstition was devoid of truth and jus tice and who must be incapable of any virtue since they could perpetrate the most atrocious of crimes the impious murder of their sovereign 4 For the crime of an ambitious centurion the

Assyrian mothers were accustomed to terrify their infants It is not improbable that a native subject of Persia should encourage his master and his friend to deliver and possess the provinces of Asia It is still more probable that Chosroes should animate his troops by the assurance that the sword which they dreaded the most would remain in its scabbard or be drawn in their favour The hero could not depend on the faith of a tyrant and the tyrant was conscious how little he deserved the obedience of a hero Narses was removed from his military command he reared an independent standard at Hierapolis in Syria he was betrayed by fallacious promises and burnt alive in the market place of Constantinople Deprived of the only chief whom they could fear or esteem the bands which he had led to victory were twice broken by the cavalry trampled by the elephants and pierced by the arrows of the barbarians and a great number of the captives were beheaded on the field of battle by the sentence

were successively be sieged reduced and destroyed by the Persian monarch he passed the Euphrates occupied the Syrian cities Hierapolis Chalcis and Berrhxa or Aleppo and soon encompassed the walls of Antiocti with his irresistible arms The rapid tide of success discloses the decay of the empire the incapacity of Phocas and the dis affection of his subjects and Chosroes provided a decent apology for their submis sion or revolt by an impostor who attended his camp as the son of Maurice 2 and the lawful heir of the monarchy The first intelligence from the east which Heraclius received 3 was that of the loss of Antioch but the aged metropolis so often overturned by earthquakes and pillaged by the enemy could supply but a small and languid stream of trea sure and Mood The Persians were equally successful and more fortunate in the sack of Cxsarea the capital of Cappadocia and as they advanced beyond the ramparts of the frontiers the boundary of ancient war they found a less obstinate resistance and a more plentiful harvest The pleasant vale of Damascus has been adorned in every age with a royal city her obscure felicity has hitherto escaped the historian of the Roman empire but Chosroes reposed his troops in the para dise of Damascus before he ascended the hills of Libanus or invaded the cities of the Phenician coast The conquest of Jerusalem 4 which had been meditated by Nushirvan was achieved by the zeal and avarice of his grandson the ruin of the proudest monument of Christianity was vehemently urged by the intolerant spirit of the Magi and he could enlist for this holy warfare an army of six and twenty thousand Jews whose furious bigotry might compensate in some degree for the want of valour and discipline After the reduction of Galilee and the region beyond

surprised by the cavalry of the Persians they passed with impunity the innumerable chan nels of the Delta and explored the long valley of the Nile from the pyramids of Memphis to the confines of Ethiopia Alexandria might have been relieved by a naval force but the archbishop and the prefect embarked for Cyprus and Chosroes entered the second city ot the empire which still preserved a wealthy remnant of industry and commerce His western trophy was erected not on the walls of Carthage 2 but in the neighbourhood of Tripoli the Greek colonies of Cyrene were finally extirpated and the conqueror treading in the footsteps of Alex ander returned in triumph through the sands of the Lybian desert In the first campaign another army advanced from the Euphrates to the Thracian Bosphorus Chalcedon surrendered after a long siege and a Persian camp was maintained above ten years in the presence of Constantinople The sea coast of Pontus the city of Ancyra and the isle of Rhodes are enumerated among the last conquests of the great king and if Chosroes had possessed any maritime power his boundless am bition would have spread slavery and desolation over the provinces of Europe From the long disputed banks of the Tigris and Euphrates the reign of the grandson of Nushirvan was suddenly extended to the Hellespont and the Nile the ancient limits of the Persian monarchy But the provinces which had been fa shioned by the habits of six hundred years to the virtues and vices of the Roman government supported with reluctance the yoke of the barbarians The idea of a republic was kept alive by the institutions or at least by the writings of the Greeks and Romans and the subjects of Heraclius had been educated to pronounce the words of liberty and law But it has always been the pride and policy of ori ental princes to display the titles and attributes of their omnipotence to upbraid a nation of slaves with their true name and abject condition and to enforce by cruel and insolent threats the rigour of their absolute commands The Christians of the east were scandalized by the worship of fire and the impious doctrine of the two principles the Magi were not less intolerant than the bishops and the martyrdom of some native Persians who had deserted the religion of Zoroaster 3 was conceived to be the prelude of a fierce and general persecution By the op pressive laws of Justinian the adversaries of the church were made the enemies of the state the alliance of the Jews Nestoriansi and Jacobites had contributed to the success of Chosroes and his partial favour to the sectaries provoked the hatred and fears of the catholic clergy Conscious of their fear and hatred the Persian conqueror governed his new subjects with an iron sceptre and as if he suspected the stability of his dominions he exhausted their wealth by exorbitant tributes and licentious rapine despoiled or demolished the temples of the east and transported to his hereditary realms the gold the silver the precious marbles the arts and the artists of the Asiatic cities In the obscure picture of the cala mities of the empire 4 it is not easy to discern the figure of Chosroes himself to separate his actions from those of his lieutenants or to ascertain his personal me rit in the general blaze of glory and magnificence He enjoyed with ostentation the fruits of victory and frequently retired from the hardships of war to the luxu ry of the palace But in the space of twenty four years he was deterred by su perstition or resentment from approaching the gates of

the time when this prediction is said to have been delivered no prophecy could be more distant from its accomplishment since the first twelve years of Heraclius announced the approaching dissolution of the empire If the motives of Chosroes had been pure and honourable he must have ended the quarrel with the death of Phocas and he would have embraced as his best ally the fortunate African who had so generously avenged the injuries of his benefactor Maurice The prosecution of the war revealed the true character of the barbarian and the suppliant embassies of Heraclius to beseech his clemency

afflicted by famine and pestilence and the emperor incapable of resistance and hopeless of relief had resolved to transfer his person and government to the more secure resi dence of Carthage His ships were already laden with the treasures of the pa lace but his flight was arrested by the patriarch who armed the powers of reli gion in the defence of his country led Heraclius to the altar of St Sophia and ex torted a solemn oath that he would live and die with the people whom God had intrusted to his care The chagan was encamped in the plains of Thrace but he dissembled his perfidious designs and solicited an interview with the emperor near the town of Heraclea Their reconciliation was celebrated with equestrian games the senate and people in their gayest apparel resorted to the festival of peace and the Avars beheld with envy and desire the spectacle of Roman luxu ry On a sudden the hippodrome was encompassed by the Scythian cavalry who had pressed their secret and nocturnal march the tremendous sound of the cha gan s whip gave the signal of the assault and Heraclius wrapping his diadem round his arm was saved with extreme hazard by the fleetness of his horse So rapid was the pursuit that the Avars almost entered the golden gate of Constan tinople with the flying crowds l but the plunder of the suburbs rewarded theii treason and they transported beyond the Danube two hundred and seventy thou sand captives On the shore of Chalcedon the emperor held a safer conference with a more honourable foe who before Heraclius descended from his galley sa luted with reverence and pity the majesty of the purple The friendly offer of Sain the Persian general to conduct an embassy to the presence of the great king was accepted with the warmest gratitude and the prayer for pardon and peace â was humbly presented by the pretorian prefect the prefect of the city and one of the first ecclesiastics of the patriarchal church 2 But the lieutenant of Chos roes had fatally mistaken the intentions of his master  It was not an embassy said the tyrant of Asia it was the person of Heraclius bound in chains that he should have brought to the foot of my throne I will never give peace to the_em peror of Rome till he has abjured his crucified God and embraced the worship of the sun Sain was flayed alive according to the inhuman practice of his coun try and the separate and rigorous confinement of the ambassadors violated the laws of nations and the faith of an express stipulation Yet the experience of six years at length persuaded the Persian monarch to renounce the conquest of Constantinople and to specify the annual tribute or ransom of the Roman empire a thousand talents of gold a thousand talents of silver a thousand silk robes a thousand horses and a thousand virgins Heraclius subscibed these ignominious terms but the time and space which he obtained to collect such treasures from the poverty of the east was industriously employed in the preparations of a bold and desperate attack Of the characters conspicuous in history that of Heraclius is one of the most extraordinary and inconsistent In the first and last years of a long reign the emperor appears to be the slave of sloth of pleasure or of superstition the care less and impotent spectator of the public calamities But the languid mists of the morning and evening are separated by the brightness of the meridian sun the Ar â cadius of the palace arose the Cxsar of the camp and the honour of Rome and Heraclius was gloriously retrieved by the exploits and trophies of six adventurous â campaigns It was the duty of the Byzantine historians to have revealed the causes of his slumber and vigilance At this distance we can only conjecture that he was endowed with more personal courage than political resolution that he was detained by the charms and perhaps the arts of his niece Martina with whom after the death of Eudocia he contracted an incestuous marriage 3 and that he yielded to the base advice of the counsellors who urged as a fundamental law that the life of the emperor should never be exposed in the field 4 Perhaps he 0 The Paschal Chronicle which

only hopes of the Ro mans were drawn from the vicissitudes of fortune which might threaten the proud prosperity of Chosroes and must be favourable to those who had attained the lowest period of depression 1 To provide for the expenses of war was the first care of the emperor and for the purpose of collecting the tribute he was al lowed to solicit the benevolence of the eastern provinces But the revenue no longer flowed in the usual channels the credit of an arbitrary prince is annihilated by his power and the courage of Heraclius was first displayed in daring to borrow the consecrated wealth of churches under the solemn vow of restoring with usury whatever he had been compelled to employ in the service of religion and of the empire The clergy themselves appear to have sympathized with the pub lic distress and the discreet patriarch of Alexandria without admitting the pre cedent of sacrilege assisted his sovereign by the miraculous or seasonable revelation of a secret treasure 2 Of the soldiers who had conspired with Phocas only two were found to have survived the stroke of time and of the barbarians 3 the loss even of these seditious veterans was imperfectly supplied by the new levies of Heraclius and the gold of the sanctuary united in the same camp the names and arms and languages of the east and west He would have been content with the neutrality of the Avars and his friendly entreaty that the chagan would act not as the enemy but as the guardian of the empire was accompanied with a more persuasive donative of two hundred thousand pieces of gold Two days after the festival of Easter the emperor exchanging his purple for the simple garb of a penitent and warrior 4 gave the signal of his departure To the faith of the people Heraclius recommended his children the civil and military powers were vested in the most deserving hands and the discretion of the patriarch and senate was authorized to save or surrender the city if they should be oppressed in his ab sence by the superior forces of the enemy The neighbouring heights of Chalcedon were covered with tents and arms but if the new levies of Heraclius had been rashly led to the attack the victory of the Persians in the sight of Constantinople might have been the last day of the Ro man empire As imprudent would it have been to advance into the provinces of Asia leaving their innumerable cavalry to intercept his convoys and continually to hang on the lassitude and disorder of his rear But the Greeks were still mas ters of the sea a fleet of galleys transports and store ships was assembled in the

DECLINE AND FALL Imperial standard The natural fortifications of Cilicia protected and even con cealed the camp of Heraclius which was pitched near Issus on the same ground where Alexander had vanquished the host of Darius The angle which the em peror occupied was deeply indented into a vast semicircle of the Asiatic Arme nian and Syrian provinces and to whatsoever point of the circumference he should direct his attack it was easy for him to dissemble his own motions and to prevent those of the enemy In the camp of Issus the Roman general reformed the sloth and disorder of the veterans and educated the new recruits in the knowledge and practice of military virtue Unfolding the miraculous image of Christ he urged them to revenge the holy altars which had been profaned by the worshippers of fire addressing them by the endearing appellations of sons and brethren he de plored the public and private wrongs of the republic The subjects of a monarch were persuaded that they fought in the cause of freedom and a similar enthusiasm was communicated to the foreign mercenaries who must have viewed with equal indifference the interest of Rome and of Persia Heraclius himself with the skill and patience of a centurion inculcated the lessons of the school of tactics and the soldiers were assiduously trained in the use of their weapons and the exercises and evolutions of the field The cavalry and infantry in light or heavy armour were divided into two parts the trumpets were fixed in the centre and their sig nals directed their march the charge the retreat or pursuit the direct or oblique order the deep or extended phalanx to represent in fictitious combat the opera tions of genuine war Whatever hardship the emperor imposed on the troops he inflicted with equal severity on himself their labour their diet their sleep were measured by the inflexible rules of discipline and without despising the enemy fhey were taught to repose an implicit confidence in their own valour and the wis dom of their leader Cilicia was soon encompassed with the Persian arms but their cavalry hesitated to enter the defiles of mount Taurus till they were circum vented by the evolutions of Heraclius who insensibly gained their rear whilst he appeared to present his front in order of battle By a false motion which seemed to threaten Armenia he drew them against their wishes to a general action They were tempted by the artful disorder of his camp but when they advanced to combat the ground the sun and the expectations of both armies were unpropi tious to the barbarians the Romans successfully repeated their tactics in a field of battle l and the event of the day declared to the world that the Persians were not invincible and that a hero was invested with the purple Strong in victory and fame Heraclius boldly ascended the heights of mount Taurus directed his march through the plains of Cappadocia and established his troops for the win ter season in safe and plentiful quarters on the banks of the river Hayls 2 His soul was superior to the vanity of entertaining Constantinople with an imperfect triumph but the presence of the emperor was indispensably required to sooth the restless and rapacious spirit of the Avars Since the days of Scipio and Hannibal no bolder enterprise has been attempted than that which Heraclius achieved for the deliverance of the empire 3 He permitted the Persians to oppress for a while the provinces and to insult with im punity the capital of the east while the Roman emperor explored his perilous way through the Black Sea

of that effeminate people their zeal and bravery were approved in the ser vice of a declining empire they abhorred and feared the usurpation of the house of Sassan and the memory of persecution envenomed their pious hatred of the enemies of Christ The limits of Armenia as it had been ceded to the emperor Maurice extended as far as the Araxes the river submitted to the dignity of a bridge l and Heraclius in the footsteps of Mark Antony advanced towards the city of Tauris or Gandzaca 2 the ancient and modern capital of one of the pro vinces of Media At the head of forty thousand men Chosroes himself had re turned from some distant expedition to oppose the progress of the Roman arms but he retreated on the approach of Heraclius declining the generous alternative of peace or battle Instead of half a million of inhabitants which have been ascribed to Tauris under the reign of the Sophys the city contained no more than three thousand houses but the value of the royal treasures was enhanced by a tradi tion that they were the spoils of Crossus which had been transported by Cyrus from the citadel of Sardes The rapid conquests of Heraclius were suspended only by the winter season a motive of prudence or superstition 3 determined his retreat into the province of Albania along the shores of the Caspian and his tents were most probably pitched in the plains of Mogan 4 the favourite encampment of oriental princes In the course of this successful inroad he signalized the zeal and revenge of a Christian emperor at his command the soldiers extinguished the fire and destroyed the temples of the Magi the statues of Chosroes who as pired to divine honours were abandoned to the flames and the ruins of Thebarma orOrmia 5 which had given birth to Zoroaster himself made some atonement for the injuries of the holy sepulchre A purer spirit of religion was shown in the relief and deliverance of fifty thousand captives Heraclius was rewarded by their tears and grateful acclamations but this wise measure which spread the fame of his benevolence diffused the murmurs of the Persians against the pride and obstinacy of their own sovereign Amidst the glories of a succeeding campaign Heraclius is almost lost to our eyes and to those of the Byzantine historians 6 From the spacious and fruitful plains of Albania the emperor appears to follow the chain of Hyrcanian mountains to de scend into the province of Media or Irak and to carry his victorious arms as far as the royal cities of Casbin and Ispahan which had never been approached by a Roman conqueror Alarmed by the danger of his kingdom the powers of Chos roes were already recalled from the Nile and the Bosphorus and three formida ble armies surrounded in a distant and hostile land the

himself secure in the walls of Salban he was surprised by the activity of Heraclius who divided his troops and performed a laborious march in the silence of the night The flat roofs of the houses were defended with useless valour against the darts and torches of the Romans the satraps and nobles of Persia with their wives and children and the flower of their martial youth were either slain or made prisoners The general escaped by a precipitate flight but his golden armour was the prize of the conqueror and the soldiers of Heraclius enjoyed the wealth and repose which they had so nobly deserved On the return of spring the emperor traversed in seven days the mountains of Curdistan and passed without resistance the rapid stream of the Tigris Oppressed by the weight of their spoils and captives the Roman army halted under the walls of Amida and Heraclius informed the senate of Constantinople of his safety and success which they had already felt by the re treat of the besiegers The bridges of the Euphrates were destroyed by the Per sians but as soon as the emperor had discovered a ford they hastily retired to de fend the banks of the Sarus l in Cilicia That river an impetuoas torrent was about three hundred feet broad the bridge was fortified with strong turrets and the banks were lined with barbarian archers After a bloody conflict which continued till the evening the Romans prevailed in the assault and a Persian of gigantic size was slain and thrown into the Sarus by the hand of the em peror himself The enemies were dispersed and dismayed Heraclius pursued Ms march to Sebaste in Cappadocia and at the expiration of three years the same coast of the Euxine applauded his return from a long and victorious expe dition 2 Instead of skirmishing on the frontier the two monarchs who disputed the em pire of the east aimed their desperate strokes at the heart of their rival The military force of Persia was wasted by the marches and combats of twenty years and many of the veterans who had survived the perils of the sword and the cli mate were still detained in the fortresses of Egypt and Syria But the revenge and ambition of Chosroes exhausted his kingdom and the new levies of subjects strangers and slaves were divided into three formidable bodies 3 The first army of fifty thousand men illustrious by the ornament and title or the golden sfiears was destined to march against Heraclius the second was stationed to pre vent his junction with the troops of his brother Theodoras and the third was com manded to besiege Constantinople and to second the operations of the chagan with whom the Persian king had ratified a treaty of alliance and partition Sabar the general of the third army penetrated through the provinces of Asia to the well known camp of Chalcedon and amused himself with the destruction of the sacred and profane buildings of the Asiatic suburbs while he impatiently waited the arrival of his Scythian friends on the opposite side of the

whole city was invested on the 31st of July from the suburbs of Pera and Galata to the Blachernse and seven towers and the inhabitants descried with terror the flaming signals of the European and Asiatic shores In the meanwhile the magistrates of Constantinople repeatedly strove to purchase the retreat of the chagan but their deputies were rejected and insulted and he suffered the patricians

the wall under the cover of the impenetrable tortoise their engines descharged a perpetual volley of stones and darts and twelve lofty towers of wood exalted the combatants to the height of the neighbouring ramparts But the senate and peo Ele were animated by the spirit of Heraclius who had detached to their relief a ody of twelve thousand cuirassiers the powers of fire and mechanics were used with superior art and success in the defence of Constantinople and the galleys with two and three ranks of oars commanded the Bosphorus and rendered the Persians the idle spectators of the defeat of their allies The Avars were re pulsed a fleet of Sclavonian canoes were destroyed in the harbour the vassels of the chagan threatened to desert his provisions were exhausted and after burning his engines he gave the signal of a slow and formidable retreat The devotion of the Romans ascribed this signal deliverance to the Virgin Mary but the mother of Christ would surely have condemned their inhuman murder of the Persian en voys who were entitled to the rights of humanity if they were not protected by the laws of nations 2 After the division of his army Heraclius prudently retired to the banks of the Phasis from whence he maintained a defensive war against the fifty thousand gold spears of Persia His anxiety was relieved by the deliverance of Constantinople his hopes were confirmed by a victory of his brother Theodoras and to the hostile league of Chosroes with the Avars the Roman emperor opposed the useful and honourable alliance of the Turks At his liberal invitation the horde of Cho zars 3 transported their tents from the plains of the Volga to the mountains of Georgia Heraclius received them in the neighbourhood of Teflis and the khan with his nobles dismounted from their horses if we may credit the Greeks and fell prostrate on the ground to adore_ the purple of the Caesar Such voluntary homage and important aid were entitled to the warmest acknowledgments and the emperor taking off his own diadem placed it on the head of the Turkish prince whom he saluted with a tender embrace and the appellation of son After a sumptuous banquet he presented Ztebel with the

artifice of Heraclius soon alienated the mind of that powerful satrap from the service of his king and coun try A messenger was intercepted with a real or fictitious mandate to the cadari gan or second in command directing him to sendj without delay to the throne Hie head of a guilty or unfortunate general The despatches were transmitted to Sarbar himself and as soon as he read the sentence of his own death he dexte rously inserted the names of four hundred officers assembled a military council and asked the cadarigan whether he was prepared to execute the commands of their tyrant The Persians unanimously declared that Chosroes had forfeited the sceptre a separate treaty was concluded with the government of Constanti nople and if some considerations of honour or policy restrained Sarbar from join ing the standard of Heraclius the emperor was assured that he might prosecute without interruption his designs of victory and peace Deprived of his firmest support and doubtful of the fidelity of his subjects the greatness of Chosroes was still conspicuous in its ruins The number of five hun dred thousand may be interpreted as an oriental metaphor to describe the men and arms the horses and elephants that covered Media and Assyria against the invasion of Heraclius Yet the Romans boldly advanced from the Araxes to the Tigris and the timid prudence of Rhazates was content to follow them by forced marches through a desolate country till he received a peremptory mandate to risk the fate of Persia in a decisive battle Eastward of the Tigris at the end of the bridge of Mosal the great Nineveh had formerly been erected l the city and even the ruins of the city had long since disappeared 2 the vacant space afforded a spacious field for the operations of the two armies But these opera tions are neglected by the Byzantine historians and like the authors of epic poe try and romance they ascribe the victory not to the military conduct but to the personal valour of their favourite hero On this memorable day Hera clius on his horse Phallus surpassed the bravest of his warriors his lip was pierced with a spear the steed was wounded in the thigh but he carried his master safe and victorious through the triple phalanx of the barbarians In the heat of the action three valiant chiefs were successively slain by the sword and lance of the emperor among these was Rhazates himself he fell like a soldier but the sight of his head scattered grief and despair through the fainting ranks of the Persians His armour of pure and massy gold the shield of one hundred and twenty plates the sword and belt the saddle and cuirass adorned the triumph of Heraclius and if he had not been faithful to Christ and his mother the champion of Rome might have offered the fourth ofiime spoils to the Jupiter of the capitoL 3 In the battle of Nineveh which was fiercely fought from day break to the ele venth hour twenty eight standards besides those which might be broken or torn were taken from the Persians the greatest part of their army was cut in pieces and the victors concealing their own loss passed the night on the field They acknowledged that on this occasion it was less difficult to kill than to discomfit the soldiers of Chosroes amidst the bodies of their friends no more than two bow shot from the enemy the remnant of the Persian cavalry stood firm till the seventh hour of the night about the eighth hour they retired to their unrifled camp col lected their baggage and dispersed on all sides from the want of orders rather than of resolution The diligence of

Romans By a just gradation of magnificent scenes they penetrated to the royal seat of Dastagerd and though much of the treasure had been removed and much had been expended the re maining wealth appears to have exceeded their hopes and even to have satiated their avarice Whatever could not be easily transported they consumed with fire that Chosroes might feel the anguish of those wounds which he had so often in flicted on the provinces of the empire and justice might allow the excuse if the desolation had been confined to the works of regal luxury if national hatred mi litary license and religious zeal had not wasted with equal rage the habitations and the temples of the guiltless subject The recovery of three hundred Roman standards and the deliverance of the numerous captives of Edessa and Alexan dria reflect a purer glory on the arms of Heraclius From the palace of Dasta gerd he pursued his march within a few miles of Modian or Ctesiphon till he was stopped on the banks of the Arba by the difficulty of the passage the rigour of the season and perhaps the fame of an impregnable capital The return of the emperor is marked by the modern name of the city of Sherhzour he fortunately passed mount Zara before the snow which fell incessantly thirty four days and the citizens of Gandzaca or Tauris were compelled to entertain his soldiers and their horses with a hospitable reception 1 When the ambition of Chosroes was reduced to the defence of his hereditary kingdom the love of glory or even the sense of shame should have urged him to meet his rival in the field In the battle of Nineveh his courage might have taught the Persians to vanquish or he might have fallen with honour by the lance of a Roman emperor The successor Â f Cyrus chose rather at a secure distance to expect the event to assemble the relics of the defeat and to retire by mea sured steps before the march of Heraclius till he beheld with a sigh the once loved mansions of Dastagerd Both his friends and enemies were persuaded that it was the intention of Chosroes to bury himself under the ruins of the city and pa lace and as both might have been equally adverse to his flight the monarch of Asia with Sira and three concubines escaped through a hole in the wall nine days before the arrival of the Romans The slow and stately procession in which he showed himself to the prostrate crowd was changed to a rapid and secret jour ney and the first evening he lodged in the cottage of a peasant whose humble door would scarcely give admittance to the great king 2 His superstition was sub dued by fear on the third day he entered with joy the fortifications of Ctesiphon yet he still doubted of his safety till he had opposed the river Tigris to the pursuit of the Romans The discovery of his flight agitated with terror and tumult the Ealace the city and the camp of Dastagerd the satraps hesitated whether they ad most to fear from their sovereign or the enemy and the females of the haram were astonished and pleased by the sight of mankind till the jealous husband of three thousand wives again confined them to a more distant castle At his com mand the army of Dastagerd retreated to a new camp the front was covered by the Arba and a line of two hundred elephants the troops of the more distant provinces successively arrived and the vilest domestics of the king and satraps were enrolled for the last defence of the throne It was still in the power of Chos roes to obtain a reasonable peace and he was repeatedly pressed by the messen gers of Heraclius to spare the blood of his subjects and to relieve a humane con queror from the painful duty of carrying fire and sword through the fairest coun tries of Asia But the pride of the Persian had not yet sunk to the level of his fortune he derived a momentary confidence from the retreat of the emperor he wept with impotent rage over the ruins of his Assyrian palaces and disregarded too long the rising murmurs of the nation who complained that their lives and fortunes were sacrificed to the obstinacy of an old man That unhappy old man was himself tortured with the sharpest pains both of mind and body and in the consciousness of his approaching end he resolved to fix the tiara on the head of Merdaza the most favoured of his sons But the will of Chosroes was no longer revered and Siroes who gloried in the rank

reign to the soldiers the heir of Chosroes pro mised an increase of pay to the Christians the free exercise of their religion to the captives liberty and rewards and to the nation an instant peace and the re duction of taxes It was determined by the conspirators that Siroes with the en signs of royalty should appear in the camp and if the enterprise should fail his escape was contrived to the imperial court But the new monarch was saluted with unanimous acclamations the flight of Chosroes yet where could he have fled was rudely arrested eighteen sons were massacred before his face and he was thrown into a dungeon where he expired on the fifth day The Greeks and modern Persians minutely describe how Chosroes was insulted and famished and tortured by the command of an inhuman son who so far surpassed the example of his father but at the time of his death what tongue would relate the story of the parricide what eye could penetrate into the loiver of darkness According to the faith and mercy of his Christian enemies he sunk without hope into a still deeper abyss 2 and it will not be denied that tyrants of every age and sect are the best entitled to such infernal abodes The glory of the house of Sassan ended â with the life of Chosroes his unnatural son enjoyed only eight months the fruit of his crimes and in the space of four years the regal title was assumed by nine can didates who disputed with the sword or dagger the fragments of an exhausted monarchy Every province and each city of Persia was the scene of independ ence of discord and of blood and the state of anarchy prevailed about eight years longer till the factions were silenced and united under the common yoke of the Arabian caliphs 3  As soon as the mountains became passable the emperor received the welcome news of the success of the conspiracy the death of Chosroes and the elevation of his eldest son to the throne of Persia The authors of the revolution eager to dis Elay their merits in the court or camp of Tauris preceded the ambassadors of iroes who delivered the letters of their master to his brother the emperor of the Romans 4 In the language of the usurpers of every age he imputes his own crimes to the Deity and without degrading his equal majesty he offers to recon cile the long discord of the two nations by a treaty of peace and alliance more du rable than brass or iron The conditions of the treaty were easily defined and faithfully executed In the recovery of the standards and prisoners which had fallen into the hands of the Persians the emperor imitated the example of Augus tus their care of the national dignity was celebrated by the poets of the times but the decay of genius may be measured by the distance between Horace and George of Pisidia the subjects and brethren of Heraclius were redeemed from persecu tion slavery and exile but instead of the Roman eagles the true wood of the holy cross was restored to the importunate demand of the successor of Constan tine The victor was not ambitious of enlarging the weakness of the empire the son of Chosroes abandoned without regret the conquests of his father the Per sians who evacuated the cities of Syria and Egypt were honourably conducted to the frontier and a war which had wounded the vitals of the two monarchies pro duced no change in their external and relative situation The return of Hera clius from Tauris to Constantinople was a perpetual triumph and after the ex ploits of six glorious campaigns he peaceably enjoyed the sabbath of his toils After a long impatience the senate the clergy and the people went forth to meet their hero with tears and acclamations with olive branches and innumerable lamps he entered the capital in a chariot drawn by four elephants and as soon as the emperor could disengage himself from the tumult of public joy he tasted more genuine satisfaction in the embraces of his mother and his son 5 1 The authentic narrative of the fall of Choiroes is

throne to receive the congratulations of the am bassadors of France and India and the fame of Moses Alexander and Hercu les 2 was eclipsed in the popular estimation by the superior merit and glory of the great Heraclius Yet the deliverer of the east was indigent and feeble Of the Persian spoils the most valuable portion had been expended in the war dis tributed to the soldiers or buried by an unlucky tempest in the waves of the Euxine The conscience of the emperor was oppressed by the obligation of re storing the wealth of the clergy which he had borrowed for their own defence a perpetual fund was required to satisfy these inexorable creditors the provinces already wasted by the arms and avarice of the Persians were compelled to a se cond payment of the same taxes and the arrears of a simple citizen the trea surer of Damascus were commuted to a fine of one hundred thousand pieces of gold The loss of two hundred thousand soldiers 3 who had fallen by the sword was of less fatal importance than the decay of arts agriculture and population in this long and destructive war and although a victorious army had been formed under the standard of Heraclius the unnatural effort appears to have exhausted rather than exercised their strength While the emperor triumphed at Constan tinople or Jerusalem an obscure town on the confines of Syria was pillaged by the Saracens and they cut in pieces some troops who advanced to its relief an ordi nary and trifling occurrence had it not been the prelude of a mighty revolution These robbers were the apostles of Mahomet their fanatic valour had emerged from the desert and in the last eight years of his reign Heraclius lost to the Arabs the same provinces which he had rescued from the Persians CHAPTER XLVII Theological

honour of the first proselytes has countenanced the belief the hope the wish that the Ebionites or at least the Nazarenes were distinguished only by their obstinate perseverance in the practice of the Mosaic rites Their churches have disappeared their books are obliterated their ob scure freedom might allow a latitude of faith and the softness of their infant creed would be variously moulded by the zeal or prudence of three hundred years Yet the most charitable criticism must refuse these sectaries any knowledge of the pure and proper divinity of Christ Educated in the school of Jewish prophecy and prejudice they had never been taught to elevate their hopes above a human and temporal Messiah 1 If they had courage to hail their king when he ap peared in a plebeian garb their grosser apprehensions were incapable of discern ing their God who had studiously disguised his celestial character under the name and person of a mortal 2 The familiar companions of Jesus of Nazareth con versed with their friend and countryman who in all the actions of rational and animal life appeared of the same species with themselves His progress from infancy to youth and manhood was marked by a regular increase in stature and wisdom and after a painful agony of mind and body he expired on the cross He lived and died for the service of mankind but the life and death of Socrates had likewise been devoted to the cause of religion and justice and although the stoic or the hero may disdain the humble virtues of Jesus the tears which he shed over his friend and country may be esteemed the purest evidence of his humanity The miracles of the gospel could not astonish a people who held with intrepid faith the more splendid prodigies of the Mosaic law The prophets of ancient days had cured diseases raised the dead divided the sea stopped the sun and ascend ed to heaven in a fiery chariot And the metaphorical style of the Hebrews might ascribe to a saint and martyr the adoptive title of Son of God Yet in the insufficient creed of the Nazarenes and the Ebionites a distinction is faintly noticed between the heretics who confounded the generation of Christ in the common order of nature and the less guilty schismatics who revered the vir ginity of his mother and excluded the aid of an earthly father The incredulity of the former was countenanced by the visible circumstances of his birth the le gal marriage of his reputed parents Joseph and Mary and his lineal claim to the kingdom of David and the inheritance of Judah But the secret and authentic history has been recorded in several copies of the gospel according to St Mat thew 3 which these sectaries long preserved in the original Hebrew 4 as the compress  If I persist in supporting each fact or reflection by its proper

pregnant of the Holy Ghost and as this distant and domestic prodigy could not fall under the personal observation of the historian he must have listened to the same voice which dictated to Isaiah the future conception of a virgin The son of a virgin generated by the ineffable operation of the Holy Spint was a creature without example or resemblance superior in every attribute of mind and body to the children of Adam Since the introduction of the Greek or Chaldean philo sophy 1 the Jews 2 were persuaded of the pre existence transmigration and immortality of souls and Providence was justified by a supposition that they were confined in their earthly prisons to expiate the stains which they had contracted in a former state 3 But the degrees of purity and corruption are almost immeasura ble It may be fairly presumed that the most sublime and virtuous of human spi rits was infused into the offspring of Mary and the Holy Ghost 4 that his abase ment was the result of his voluntary choice and that the object of his mission was to purify not his own but the sins of the world On his return to his native skies he received the immense reward of his obedience the everlasting kingdom of the Messiah which had been darkly foretold by the prophets under the carnal images of peace of conquest and of dominion Omnipotence could enlarge the human faculties of Christ to the extent of his celestial office In the language of antiquity the title of God has not been severely confined to the first parent and his incomparable minister his only begotten Son might claim without presump tion the religious though secondary worship of a subject world II The seeds of the faith which had slowly arisen in the rocky and ungrateful soil of Judea were transplanted in full maturity to the happier climes of the Gentiles and the strangers of Rome or Asia who never beheld the manhood were the more readily disposed to embrace the divinity of Christ The Polythe ist and the philosopher the Greek and the barbarian were alike accustomed to conceive a long succession an infinite chain of angels or demons or deities or sons or emanations issuing from the throne of light Nor could it seem strange or incredible that the first of these asons the Logos or Word of God of the same substance with the Father should descend upon earth to deliver the human race from vice and error and to conduct them in the paths of life and immortality But the prevailing doctrine of the eternity and inherent pravity of matter infected the primitive churches of the east Many among the Gentile proselytes refused to believe that a celestial spirit an undivided portion of the first essence had been personally united with a mass of impure and contaminated flesh and in their zeal for the divinity they piously abjured the humanity of Christ While his blood was still recent on mount Calvary 5 the Docetes a numerous and learned sect of Asi atics invented the fantastic system which was afterwards propagated by the Mar cionites the Manichaians and the various names of the Gnostic heresy 6 They de nied the truth and authenticity of the gospels as far as they relate the conception of protectant critics But

AND FALL Mary the birth of Christ and the thirty years that preceded the exercise of hi ministry He first appeared on the banks of the Jordan in the form of perfect manhood but it was a form only and not a substance a human figure created by the hand of Omnipotence to imitate the faculties and actions of a man and to im pose a perpetual illusion on the senses of his friends and enemies Articulate sounds vibrated on the ears of the disciples but the image which was impressed on their optic nerve eluded the more stubborn evidence of the touch and they enjoyed the spiritual not the corporeal presence of the Son of God The rage of the Jews was idly wasted against an impassive phantom and the mystic scenes of the passion and death and the resurrection of Christ were represented on the theatre of Jerusalem for the benefit of mankind If it were urged that such ideal mimicry such incessant deception was unworthy of the God of truth the Docetes agreed itit too many of their orthodox brethren in the justification of pious false hood In the system of the Gnostics the Jehovah of Israel the creator of this lower world was a rebellious or at least an ignorant spirit The Son of God de scended upon earth to abolish his temple and his law and for the accomplishment of this salutary end he dexterously transferred to his own person the hope and predictiori of a temporal Messiah One of the most subtle disputants of the Manichaean school has pressed the danger and the indecency of supposing that the God of the Christians in the state of a human fetus emerged at the end of nine months from a female womb The pious horror of his antagonists provoked them to disclaim all sensual circumstances of conception and delivery to maintain that the divinity passed through Mary like a sun beam through a plate of glass and to assert that the seal of her virginity re mained unbroken even at the moment when she became the mother of Christ But the rashness of these concessions has encouraged a milder sentiment of those of the Docetes who taught not that Christ was a phantom but that he was clothed with an impassable and incorruptible body Such indeed in the more orthodox system he has acquired since his resurrection and such he must have always pos sessed if it were capable of pervading without resistance or injury the density of intermedials matter Devoid of its most essential properties it might be ex empt from the attributes and infirmities of the flesh A foetus that could increase from an invisible point to its full maturity a child that could attain the stature of perfect manhood without deriving any nourishment from the ordinary sources might continue to exist without repairing a daily waste from a daily supply of ex ternal matter Jesus might share the repasts of his disciples without being sub ject to the calls of thirst or hunger and his virgin purity was never sullied by the involuntary stains of sensual concupiscence Of a body thus singularly constituted a question would arise by what means and of what materials it was originally framed and our sounder theology is startled by an answer which was not peculiar to the Gnostics that both the form and the substance proceeded from the divine essence The idea of pure and absolute spirit is a refinement of modern philoso phy the incorporeal essence ascribed by the ancients to human souls celestial beings and even the Deity himself does not exclude the notion of extended space and their imagination was satisfied with a subtle nature of air or fire or ether in comparably more perfect than the grossness of the material world If we define the place we must describe the figure of the Deity Our experience perhaps our vanity represents the power of reason and virtue under a human form

fleeting shadows of the Docetes A more substantial though less simple hypothesis was contrived by Cerinthus of Asia l who dared to oppose the last of the apostles Placed on the confines of the Jewish and Gen tile world he laboured to reconcile the Gnostic with the Ebionite by confessing in the same Messiah the supernatural union of a man and a God and this mystic doctrine was adopted with many fanciful improvements by Carpocrates Basihdes and Valentine 2 the heretics of the Egyptian school In their eyes Jesus of Nazareth was a mere mortal the legitimate son of Joseph and Mary but he was the best and wisest of the human race selected as the worthy instrument to restore upon earth the worship of the true and supreme Deity When he was baptized in the Jordan the Christ the first of the seons the son of God himself descended on Je sus in the form of a dove to inhabit his mind and direct his actions during the al lotted period of his ministry When the Messiah was delivered into the hands of the Jews the Christ an immortal and impassable being forsook his earthly ta bernacle flew back to the fileroma or world of spirits and left the solitary Jesus to suffer to complain and to expire But the justice and generosity of such a deser tion are strongly questionable and the fate or an innocent martyr at first impelled and at length abandoned by his divine companion might provoke the pity and indignation of the profane Their murmurs were variously silenced by the sec taries who espoused and modified the double system of Cerinthus It was alleged that when Jesus was nailed to the cross he was endowed with a miraculous apa thy of mind and body which rendered him insensible of his apparent sufferings It was affirmed that these momentary though real pangs would be abundantly repaid by the temporal reign of a thousand years reserved for the Messiah in his kingdom of the New Jerusalem It was insinuated that if he suffered he de served to suffer that human nature is never absolutely perfect and that the cross and passion might serve to expiate the venial transgressions of the son of Joseph before his mysterious union with the Son of God 3 IV All those who believe the immateriality of the soul a specious and noble tenet must confess from their present experience the incomprehensible union of mind and matter A similar union is not inconsistent with a much higher or even with the highest degree of mental faculties and the incarnation of an a on or arch angel the most perfect of created spirits does not involve any positive contradic tion or absurdity In the age of religious freedom which was determined by the council of Nice the dignity of Christ was measured by private judgment accord ing to the indefinite rule of Scripture or reason or tradition But wlien his pure and proper divinity had been established on the ruins of Arianism the faith of the catholics trembled on the edge of a precipice where it was impossible to re cede dangerous to stand dreadful to fall and the manifold inconveniences of their creed were aggravated by the sublime character of their theology They hesi tated to pronounce that God himself the second person of an equal and consub stantial trinity was manifested in the flesh 4 that a being who pervades the uni verse had been confined in the womb of Mary that his eternal duration had been marked by the days and months and years of human existence that the Al mighty had been scourged and crucified that his impassable essence had felt pain and anguish that his omniscience was not exempt from ignorance and that the 1 St John

Christ and Jesus were sons though of different degrees the one acting as the rational soul the other as the divine spirit of the Sa viour 3 At the time of the passion they both retired and left onlya sensitive soul and a human body 3 Even that body was etberial and perhaps apparent â Such are the lahorious conclusions of Mosheim But I much doubt whether the Latin translator understood Irenseus and

one of the luminaries of the church The son of a learned gram marian he was skilled in all the sciences of Greece eloquence erudition and philosophy conspicuous in the volumes of Apollinaris were humbly devoted to the service of religion The worthy friend of Athanasius the worthy antagonist of Julian he bravely wrestled with the Arians and polytheists and though he af fected the rigour of geometrical demonstration his commentaries revealed the li teral and allegorical sense of the Scriptures A mystery which had long floated in the looseness of popular belief was defined by his perverse diligence in a tech nical form and he first proclaimed the memorable words â One incarnate na ture of Christ which are still re echoed with hostile clamours in the churches of Asia Egypt and Ethiopia He taught that the Godhead was united or mingled with the body of a man and that the Logos the eternal Wisdom supplied in the flesh the place and office of a human soul Yet as the profound doctor had been terrified at his own rashness Apollinaris was heard to mutter some faint ac cents of excuse and explanation He acquiesced in the old distinction of the Greek philosophers between the rational and sensitive soul of man that he might reserve the Logos for intellectual functions and employ the subordinate human principle in the meaner actions of animal life With the moderate Docetes he revered Mary as the spiritual rather than as the carnal mother of Christ whose body either came from heaven impassable and incorruptible or was absorbed and as it were transformed into the essence of the Deity The system of Apol linaris was strenuously encountered by the Asiatics and Syrian divines whose schools are honoured by the names of Basil Gregory and Chrysostom and taint ed by those of Diodorus Theodoric and Nestorius But the person of the aged bishop of Laodicea his character and dignity remained inviolate and his rivals since we may not suspect them of the weakness of toleration were astonished perhaps by the novelty of the argument and diffident of the final sentence of the catholic church Her judgment at length inclined in their favour the heresy of Apollinaris was condemned and the separate congregations of his disciples were proscribed by the imperial laws But his principles were secretly entertained in the monasteries of Egypt and his enemies felt the hatred of Theophilus and Cy ril the successive patriarchs of Alexandria V The grovelling Ebionite and the fantastic Docetes were rejected and for gotten the recent zeal against the errors of Apollinaris reduced the catholics to a seeming agreement with the double nature of Cerinthus But instead of a tem porary and occasional alliance they established and we still embrace the substan tial indissoluble and everlasting union of a perfect God with a perfect man or the second person of the trinity with a reasonable soul and human flesh In the beginning of the fifth century the unity of the two natures was the prevailing doctrine of the church On all sides it was confessed that the mode of their co existence could neither be represented by our ideas nor expressed by our lan guage Yet a secret and incurable discord was cherished between those who were most apprehensive of confounding and those who were most fearful of sepa rating the divinity and the humanity of Christ Impelled by religious frenzy they fled with adverse haste from the error which they mutually deemed most destructive of truth and salvation On either hand they were anxious to guard they were jealous to defend the union and the distinction of the two natures and to invent such forms of speech such symbols of doctrine as were least susceptible of doubt or ambiguity The poverty of ideas and language tempted them to ransack art and nature for every possible comparison and each com parison misled their fancy in the explanation of an incomparable mystery In the polemic microscope an atom is enlarged to a monster and each party was skil ful to exaggerate the absurd or impious conclusions that might be extorted from the principles of their adversaries To escape from each other they wandered through many a dark and devious thicket till they were astonished by the horrid phantoms of Cerinthus and Apollinaris who guarded the opposite issues of the theological labyrinth As soon as they beheld the twilight ot

faith Yet a latent and almost invisible spark still lurked among the embers of controversy by the breath of prejudice and passion it was quickly kindled to a mighty flame and the verbal disputers l of the oriental sects have shaken the pillars of the church and state The name of Cyril of Alexandria is famous in controversial story and the ti tle of saint is a mark that his opinions and his party have finally prevailed In the house of his uncle the archbishop Theophilus he imbibed the orthodox les sons of zcal and dominion and five years of his youth were profitably spent in the adjacent monasteries of Nitria Under the tuition of the abbot Serapion he ap plied himself to ecclesiastical studies with such indefatigable ardour that in the course of one sleepless night he has perused the four gospels the catholic epis tles and the epistle to the Romans Origen he detested but the writings of Cle mens and Dionysius of Athanasius and Basil were continually in his hands by the theory and practice of dispute his faith was confirmed and his wit was sharpened he extended round his cell the cobwebs of scholastic theology and meditated the works of allegory and metaphysics whose remains in seven verbose folios now peaceably slumber by the side of their rivals 2 Cyril prayed and fasted in the desert but his thoughts it is the reproach of a friend 3 were still fixed on the world and the call of Theophilus who summoned him to the tumult of cities and synods was too readily obeyed by the aspiring hermit With the approbation of his uncle he assumed the office and acquired the fame of a popular preacher His comely person adorned the pulpit the harmony of his voice resounded in the cathedral his friends were stationed to lead or second the applause of the congre gation 4 and the hasty notes of the scribes preserved his discourses which in their effect though not in their composition might be compared with those of the Athenian orators The death of Theophilus expanded and realized the hopes of his nephew The clergy of Alexandria were divided the soldiers and their ge neral supported the claims of the archdeacon but a resistless multitude with voices and with hands asserted the cause of their favourite and after a period of thirty nine years Cyril was seated on the throne of Athanasius 5 The prize was not unworthy of his ambition At a distance from the court and at the head of an immense capital the patriarch as he was now styled of Alex andria had gradually usurped the state and authority of a civil magistrate The public and private charities of the city were managed by his discretion his voice inflamed or appeased the passions of the multitude his commands were blindly obeyed by his numerous and fanatic fiarabolani 6 familiarized in their daily of fice with scenes of death and the prefects of Egypt were awed or provoked by the temporal power of these Christian pontiffs Ardent in the prosecution of heresy Cyril auspiciously opened his reign by oppressing the Novatians the most innocent and harmless of the sectaries The interdiction of their religious wor ship appeared in his eyes a just and meritorious act and he confiscated their holy vessels without

remnant of the unbelieving nation Perhaps he might plead the insolence of their prosperity and their deadly hatred of the Christians whose blood they had recently shed in a malicious or accidental tumult Such crimes would have deserved the animadversion of the magistrate but in this pro miscuous outrage the innocent were confounded with the guilty and Alexandria was impoverished by the loss of a wealthy and industrious colony The zeal of Cyril exposed him to the penalties of the Julian law but in a feeble government and a superstitious age he was secure of impunity and even of praise Orestes complained but his just complaints were too quickly forgotten by the ministers of Theodosius and too deeply remembered by a priest who affected to pardon and continued to hate the prefect of Egypt As he passed through the streets his chariot was assaulted by a band of five hundred of the Nitrian monks his guards fled from the wild beasts of the desert his protestations that he was a Christian and a catholic were answered by a volley of stones and the face of Orestes was covered with blood The loyal citizens of Alexandria hastened to his rescue he instantly satisfied his justice and revenge against the monk by whose hand he had been wounded and Ammonius expired under the rod of the lictor At the com mand of Cyril his body was raised from the ground and transported in solemn procession to the cathedral the name of Ammonius was changed to that of Thau masius the wonderful his tomb was decorated with the trophies of martyrdom and the patriarch ascended the pulpit to celebrate the magnanimity of an assassin and a rebel Such honours might incite the faithful to combat and die under the banners of the saint and he soon prompted or accepted the sacrifice of a virgin who professed the religion of the Greeks and cultivated the friendship of Orestes Hypatia the daughter of Theon the mathematician l was initiated in her fa ther s studies her learned comments have elucidated the geometry of Apollonius and Diophantus and she publicly taught both at Athens and Alexandria the phi losophy of Plato and Aristotle In the bloom of beauty and in the maturity of wisdom the modest maid refused her lovers and instructed her disciples the per sons most illustrious for their rank or merit were impatient to visit the female phi losopher and Cyril beheld with jealous eye the gorgeous train of horses and slaves who crowded the door of her academy A rumour was spread among the Christians that the daughter of Theon was the only obstacle to the reconciliation of the prefect and the archbishop and that obstacle was speedily removed On a fatal day in the holy season of lent Hypatia was torn from her chariot stripped naked dragged to the church and inhumanly butchered by the hands of Peter the reader and a troop of savage and merciless fanatics her flesh was scraped from her bones with sharp oyster shells 2 and her quivering limbs were delivered to the flames The just progress of inquiry and punishment was stopped by sea sonable gifts but the murder of Hypatia has imprinted an indelible stain on the character and religion of Cyril of Alexandria 3 Superstition perhaps would more gently expiate the blood of a virgin than the banishment of a saint and Cyril had accompanied his uncle to the iniquitous synod of the oak When the memory of Chrysostom

world 1 His enmity to the Byzantine pontiffs 2 was a sense of interest not a sally of passion he envied their fortunate station in the sunshine of the imperial court and he dreaded their upstart ambition which oppressed the metropolitans of Europe and Asia invaded the provinces of Antioch and Alexandria and measured their diocess by the limits of the empire The long moderation of Atticus the mild usurper of the throne of Chrysostom suspended the animosities of the eastern patriarchs but Cyril was at length awakened by the exaltation of a rival more worthy of his esteem and ha tred After the short and troubled reign of Sisinnius bishop of Constantinople the factions of the clergy and people were appeased by the choice of the emperor who on this occasion consulted the voice of fame and invited the merit of a stranger Nestorius 3 a native of Germanicia and a monk of Antioch was re commended by the austerity of his life and the eloquence of his sermons but the first homily which he preached before the devout Theodosius betrayed the acri mony and impatience of his zeal  Give me O Csesar he exclaimed  give me the earth purged of heretics and I will give you in exchange the kingdom of heaven Exterminate with me the heretics and with you I will exterminate the Persians On the fifth day as if the treaty had been already signed the pa triarch of Constantinople discovered surprised and attacked a secret conventicle of the Arians they preferred death to submission the flames that were kindled by their despair soon spread to the neighbouring houses and the triumph of Nes torius was clouded by the name of incendiary On either side of the Hellespont his episcopal vigour imposed a rigid formulary of faith and discipline a chronolo gical error concerning the festival of Easter was punished as an offence against the church and state Lydia and Caria Sardes and Miletus were purified with the blood of the obstinate Quartodecimans and the edict of the emperor or ra ther of the patriarch enumerates three and twenty degrees and denominations in the guilt and punishment of heresy 4 But the sword of persecution which Nestorius so furiously wielded was soon turned against his own breast Religion was the pretence but in the judgment of a cotemporary saint ambition was the genuine motive of episcopal warfare 5 In the Syrian school Nestorius had been taught to abhor the confusion of the two natures and nicely to discriminate the humanity of his master Christ from the divinity of the Lord Jesus 6 The blessed Virgin he revered as the mother of Christ but his ears were offended with the rash and recent title of mother of God 7 which had been insensibly adopted since the origin of the Arian contro versy From the pulpit of Constantinople a friend of the patriarch and

clamour his authority and doctrine were renounced by separate congregations every wind scattered round the empire the leaves of controversy and the voice of the combatants on a sonorous theatre re echoed in the cells of Palestine and Egypt It was the duty of Cyril to enlighten the zeal and ignorance of his innumerable monks in tlie school of Alexandria he had imbibed and professed the incarnation of one nature and the successor of Atha nasius consulted his pride and ambition when he rose in arms against another Arius more formidable and more guilty on the second throne of the hierarchy After a short correspondence in which the rival prelates disguised their hatred in the hollow language of respect and charity the patriarch of Alexandria de nounced to the prince and people to the east and to the west the damnable er rors of the Byzantine pontiff From the east more especially from Antioch he obtained the ambiguous counsels of toleration and silence which were addressed to both parties while they favoured the cause of Nestorius But the Vatican re ceived with open arms the messengers of Egypt The vanity of Celestine was flattered by the appeal and the partial version of a monk decided the faith of the pope who with his Latin clergy was ignorant of the language the arts and the theology of the Greeks At the head of an Italian synod Celestine weighed the merits of the cause approved the creed of Cyril condemned the sentiments and person of Nestorius degraded the heretic from his episcopal dignity allowed a respite of ten days for recantation and penance and delegated to his enemy the execution of this rash and illegal sentence But the patriarch of Alexandria whilst he darted the thunders of a god exposed the errors and passions of a mortal and his twelve 3 anathemas still torture the orthodox slaves who adore the memory of a saint without forfeiting their allegiance to the synod of Chalce don These bold assertions are indelibly tinged with the colours of the Apollina rian heresy but the serious and perhaps the sincere professions of Nestorius have satisfied the wiser and less partial theologians of the present times 4 Yet neither the emperor nor the primate of the east were disposed to obey the mandate of an Italian priest and a synod of the catholic or rather of the Greek church was unanimously demanded as the sole remedy that could appease or de cide this ecclesiastical quarrel 5 Ephesus on all sides accessible by sea and land was chosen for the place the festival of Pentecost for the day of the meet ing a writ of summons was despatched to each metropolitan and a guard was sta tioned to protect and confine the fathers till they should settle the mysteries of heaven and the faith of the earth Nestorius appeared not as a criminal but

eloquence and liberality made a daily increase in the number of his adherents and the Egyptian soon computed that he might command the attendance and the voices of two hundred bishops 2 But the au

distant capital of the east Impatient of a delay which he stigmatized as voluntary and culpable 3 Cyril announced the opening of the synod sixteen days after the festival of Pentecost Nestorius who depended on the near approach of his eastern friends persisted like his prede cessor Chrysostom to disclaim the jurisdiction and to disobey the summons of his enemies they hastened his trial and his

transaction was crowded into the compass of a summer s day the bishops delivered their separate opinions but the uniformity of style reveals the influence or the hand of a master who has been accused of corrupting the public evidence of their acts and subscriptions 4 Without a dis senting voice they recognised in the epistles of Cyril the Nicene creed and the doctrine of the fathers but the partial extracts from the letters and homilies of Nestorius were interrupted by curses and anathemas and the heretic was de graded from his episcopal and ecclesiastical dignity The sentence

Virgin was defiled with rage and clamour with sedition and blood the rival synods darted anathemas and excom munications from their spiritual engines and the court of Theodosius was per plexed by the adverse and contradictory narratives of the Syrian and Egyptian factions During a busy period of three months the emperor tried every method except the most effectual means of indifference and contempt to reconcile this theological quarrel He attempted to remove or intimidate the leaders by a com mon sentence of acquittal or condemnation he invested his representatives at Ephesus with ample power and military force he summoned from either party eight chosen deputies to a free and candid conference in the neighbourhood of the capital far from the contagion of popular frenzy But the orientals refused to yield and the catholics proud of their numbers and of their Latin allies rejected all terms of union or toleration The patience of the meek Theodosius was pro voked and he

not the author of this confusion His providence will discern and punish the guilty Return to your provinces and may your private virtues repair the mischief and scandal of your meeting They returned to their provinces but the same passions which had distracted the synod of Ephesus were diffused over the eastern world After three obstinate and equal campaigns John of Antioch and Cyril of Alexandria condescended to explain and embrace but their seeming re union must be im puted rather to prudence than to reason to the mutual lassitude rather than to the Christian charity of the patriarchs The Byzantine pontiff had instilled into the royal ear a baleful prejudice against the character and conduct of his Egyptian rival An epistle of menace and in vective 2 which accompanied the summons accused him as a busy insolent and envious priest who perplexed the simplicity of the faith violated the peace of the church and state and by his artful and separate addresses to the wife and sister of Theodosius presumed to suppose or to scatter the seeds of discord in the imperial family At the stern command of his sovereign Cyril had repaired to Ephesus where he was resisted threatened and confined by the magistrates in the interest of Nestorius and the orientals who assembled the troops of Lydia and Ionia to suppress the fanatic and disorderly train of the patriarch Without ex pecting the royal license he escaped from his guards precipitately embarked deserted the imperfect synod and retired to his episcopal fortress of safety and independence But his artful emissaries both in the court and city successfully laboured to appease the resentment and to conciliate the favour of the emperor The feeble son of Arcadius was alternately swayed by his wife and sister by the eunuchs and women of the palace superstition and avarice were their ruling pas sions and the orthodox chiefs were assiduous in their endeavours to alarm the former and to gratify the latter Constantinople and the suburbs were sanctified with frequent monasteries and the holy abbots Dalmatius and Eutyches 3 had devoted their zeal and fidelity to the cause of Cyril the worship of Mary and the unity of Christ From the first moment of their monastic life they had never mingled with the world or trod the profane ground of the city But in this awful moment of the danger of the

the saints who boldly pronounced that none could hope for salvation unless they embraced the person and the creed of the orthodox successor of Athanasius At the same time every avenue of the throne was assaulted with gold Under the decent names of eulogies and benedictions the courtiers of both sexes were bribed according to the measure of their power and rapaciousness But their incessant demands despoiled the sanctuaries of Con stantinople and Alexandria and the authority of the patriarch was unable to si lence the just murmur of his clergy that a debt of 60 000 had already been con tracted to support the expense of this scandalous corruption l Pulcheria who relieved her brother from the weight of an empire was the firmest pillar of or thodoxy and so intimate was the alliance between the thunders of the synod and the whispers of the court that Cyril was assured of success if he could displace one eunuch and substitute another in the favour of Theodosius Yet the Egyptian could not boast of a glorious or decisive victory The emperor with unaccus tomed firmness adhered to his promise of protecting the innocence of the oriental bishops and Cyril softened his anathemas and confessed with ambiguity and re luctance a twofold nature of Christ before he was permitted to satiate his revenge against the unfortunate Nestorius 2 The rash and obstinate Nestorius before the end of the synod was oppressed by Cyril betrayed by the court and faintly supported by his eastern friends A sentiment of fear or indignation prompted him while it was yet time to affect the glory of a voluntary abdication his wish or at least his request was readily granted he was conducted with honour from Ephesus to his old monastery of An tioch and after a short pause his successors Maximian and Proclus were ac knowledged as the lawful bishops of Constantinople But in the silence of his cell the degraded patriarch could no longer resume the innocence and security of a private monk The

afford some colour to the scandalous report that his tongue the organ of blasphemy had been eaten by the worms He was buried in a city of Upper Egypt known by the names of Chemnis or Panapolis or Akmin 2 but the immortal malice of the Jacobites has persevered for ages to cast stones against his sepulchre and to propagate the fool ish tradition that it was never watered by the rain of heaven which equally de scends on the righteous and the ungodly 3 Humanity may drop a tear on the fate of Nestorius yet justice must observe that he suffered the persecution which he had approved and inflicted 4 The death of the Alexandrian primate after a reign of thirty two years aban doned the catholics to the intemperance of zeal and the abuse of victory 5 The Monofihysite doctrine one incarnate nature was rigorously preached in the churches of Egypt and the monasteries of the east the primitive creed of Apolli naris was protected by the sanctity of Cyril and the name of Eutyches his venera ble friend has been applied to the sect most adverse to the Syrian heresy of Nesto rius His rival Eutyches was the abbot or archimandrite or superior of three hun dred monks but the opinions of a simple and illiterate recluse might have expired in the cell where he had slept above seventy years if the resentment or indiscre tion of Flavian the Byzantine pontiff had not exposed the scandal to the eyes of the Christian world His domestic synod was instantly convened their proceed ings were sullied with clamour and artifice and the aged heretic was surprised into a seeming confession that Christ had not derived his body from the substance of the Virgin Mary From their partial decree Eutyches appealed to a general council and his cause was vigorously asserted by his godson Chrysaphius the reigning eunuch of the palace and his accomplice Dioscorus who had succeeded to the throne the creed the talents and the vices of the nephew of Theophilus By the special summons of Theodosius the second synod of Ephesus was judiciously composed of ton metropolitans and ten bishops from each of the six diocesses of the eastern empire some exceptions of favour or merit enlarged the number to one hundred and thirty five and the Syrian Barsumas as the chief and representative of the monks was invited to sit and vote with the successors of the apostles But the despotism of the Alexandrian patriarch again oppressed the freedom of de bate the same spiritual and carnal weapons were again drawn from the arsenals of Egypt the Asiatic veterans a band of archers served under the orders of Dioscorus and the more formidable monks whose minds were inaccessible to rea son or mercy besieged the doors of the cathedral The general and as it should seem the unconstrained voice of the fathers accepted the faith arid even the ana themas of Cyril and the heresy of the two natures was formally condemned in the persons and writings of the most learned orientals  May those who divide

a furious multitude of monks and soldiers with staves and swords and chains burst into the church the trembling bishops hid themselves behind the altar or under the benches and as they were not

and kicked and trampled his brother of Constantinople 1 it is certain that the vic tim before he could reach the place of his exile expired on the third day of the wounds and bruises which he had received at Ephesus This second synod has been justly branded as a gang of robbers and assassins yet the accusers of Di oscorus would magnify his violence to alleviate the cowardice and inconstancy of their own behaviour The faith of Egypt had prevailed but the vanquished party was supported by the same pope who encountered without fear the hostile rage of Attila and Gen seric The theology of Leo his famous tome or epistle on the mystery of the incar nation had been disregarded by the synod of Ephesus his authority and that of the Latin church was insulted in his legates who escaped from slavery and death to relate the melancholy tale of the tyranny of Dioscorus and the martyrdom of Flavian His provincial synod annulled the irregular proceedings of Ephesus but as this step was itself irregular he solicited the convocation of a general council in the free and orthodox provinces of Italy From his independent throne the Ro man bishop spoke and acted without danger as the head of the Christians and his dictates were obsequiously transcribed by Placidia and her son Valentinian who addressed their eastern colleague to restore the peace and unity of the church But the pageant of oriental royalty was moved with equal dexterity by the hand of the eunuch and Theodosius could pronounce without hesitation that the church was already peaceful and triumphant and that the recent flame had been extinguished by the just punishment of the Nestorians Perhaps the Greeks would be still involved in the heresy of the Monophysites if the emperor s horse had not fortunately stumbled Theodosius expired his orthodox sister Pulcheria with a nominal husband succeeded to the throne Chrysaphius was burnt Dios corus was disgraced the exiles were recalled and the tome of Leo was subscribed by the oriental bishops Yet the pope was disappointed in his favourite project of a Latin council he disdained to preside in the Greek synod which was speedily assem bled at Nice in Bithynia his legates required in a peremptory tone the presence of the emperor and the wary fathers were transported to Chalcedon under the im mediate eye of Marcian and the senate of Constantinople A quarter of a mile from the Thracian Bosphorus the church of St Euphemia was built on the sum mit of a gentle though lofty ascent the triple structure was celebrated as a pro digy of art and the boundless prospect of the land and sea might have raised the mind of a sectary to the contemplation of the God of the universe Six hundred and thirty bishops were ranged in order in the nave of the church but the patri archs of the east were preceded by the legates of whom the third was a simple priest and the place of honour was reserved for twenty laymen of consular or se natorian rank The gospel was ostentatiously displayed in the centre but the rule of faith was defined by the papal and imperial ministers who moderated the thirteen sessions of the council of Chalcedon 2 Their partial

THE DECLINE AND FALL fenced the intemperate shouts and execrations which degraded the episcopal gra vity but on the formal accusation of the legates Dioscorus was compelled to descend from his throne to the rank of a criminal already condemned in the opi nion of his judges The orientals less averse to Nestorius than to Cyril ac cepted the Romans as their deliverers Thrace and Pontus and Asia were exas perated against the murderer of Flavian and the new patriarchs of Constantinople and Antioch secured their places by the sacrifice of their benefactor The bi shops of Palestine Macedonia and Greece were attached to the faith of Cyril but in the face of the synod in the heat of the battle the leaders with their obse quious train passed from the right to the left wing and decided the victory by this seasonable desertion of the seventeen suffragans who sailed from Alexandria four were tempted from their allegiance and the thirteen falling prostrate on the ground implored the mercy of the council with sighs and tears and a pathetic declaration that if they yielded they should be massacred on their return to Egypt by the indignant people A tardy repentance was allotted to expiate the guilt or error of the accomplices of Dioscorus but their sins were accumulated on his head he neither asked nor hoped for pardon and the moderation of those who pleaded for a general amnesty was drowned in the prevailing cry of victory and revenge To save the reputation of his late adherents some personal offences were skilfully detectedâ his rash and illegal excommunication of the pope and his contumacious refusal while he was detained a prisoner to attend the summons of the synod Witnesses were introduced to prove the special facts of his pride ava rice and cruelty and the fathers heard with abhorrence that the alms of the church were lavished on the female dancers that his palace and even his bath â was open to the prostitutes of Alexandria and that the infamous Pansophia or Irene was publicly entertained as the concubine of the patriarch l For these scandalous offences Dioscorus was deposed by the synod and banished by the emperor but the purity of his faith was declared in the presence and with the tacit approbation of the fathers Their prudence supposed rather than pro nounced the heresy of Eutyches who was never summoned before their tribunal and they sat silent and abashed when a bold Monophysite casting at their feet a volume of Cyril challenged them to anathematize in his person the doctrine of the saint If we fairly peruse the acts of Chalcedon as they are recorded by the or thodox party 2 we shall find that a great majority of the bishops embraced the simple unity of Christ and the ambiguous concession that he was formed of or from two natures might imply either their previous existence or their subse quent confusion or some dangerous interval between the conception of the man and the assumption of the God The Roman theology more positive and precise adopted the term most offensive to the ears of the Egyptians that Christ existed in two natures and this momentous particle 3 which the memory rather than the understanding must retain had almost produced a schism among the catho lic bishops The tome of Leo had been respectfully perhaps sincerely subscribed but they protested in two successive debates that it was neither expedient nor lawful to transgress the sacred landmarks which had been fixed at Nice Constan tinople and Ephesus according to the rule of Scripture and tradition At length they yielded to the importunities of their masters but their infallible decree after it had been ratified with deliberate votes and vehement acclamations was over turned in the next session by the opposition of the legates and their oriental

was imposed on the reluctant assembly In the name of the fourth general council the Christ in one person but in two natures was announced to the catholic world an invisible line was drawn between the heresy of Apollinaris and the faith of St Cyril and the road to paradise a bridge as sharp as a razor was suspended over the abyss by the master hand of the theological artist During ten centuries of blindness and servitude Europe received her religious opinions from the oracle of the Vatican and the same doctrine already varnished with the rust of antiquity was admitted without dispute into the creed of the reformers who disclaimed the supremacy of the Roman pontiff The synod of Chalcedon still triumphs in the protestant churches but the ferment of controversy has subsided and the most pious Chris tians of the present day are ignorant or careless of their own belief concerning the mystery of the incarnation Far different was the temper of the Greeks and Egyptians under the orthodox reigns of Leo and Marcian Those pious emperors enforced with arms and edicts the symbol of their faith 2 and it was declared by the conscience or honour of five hundred bishops that the decrees of the synod of Chalcedon might be law fully supported even with blood The catholics observed with satisfaction that the same synod was odious both to the Nestorians and the Monophysites 3 but the Nestorians were less angry or less powerful and the east was distracted by the obstinate and sanguinary zeal of the Monophysites Jerusalem was occupied by an army of monks in the name of the one incarnate nature they pillaged they burnt they murdered the sepulchre of Christ was defiled with blood and the gates of the city were guarded in tumultuous rebellion against the troops of the emperor After the disgrace and exile of Dioscorus the Egyptians still re gretted their spiritual father and detested the usurpation of his successor who was introduced by the fathers of Chalcedon The throne of Proterius was supported by a guard of two thousand soldiers he waged a five years war against the people of Alexandria and on the first intelligence of the death of Marcian he became the victim of their zeal On the third day before the festival of Easter the patriarch was besieged in the cathedral and murdered in the baptistery The remains of his mangled corpse were delivered to the flames and his ashes to the wind and the deed was inspired by the vision of a pretended angel an ambitious monk who under the name of Timothy the Cat 4 succeeded to the place and opinions of Dioscorus This deadly superstition was inflamed on either side by the principle and the practice of retaliation in the pursuit of a meta physical quarrel many thousands 5 were slain and the Christians of every de gree were deprived of the substantial enjoyments of social life and of the invi sible gifts of baptism and the holy communion Perhaps an extravagant fable of the times may conceal an allegorical picture of these fanatics

DECLINE AND FALL  The disorders of thirty years at length produced the famous Henoticon 1 of the emperor Zeno which in his reign and in that of Anastasius was signed by all the bishops of the east under the penalty of degradation and exile if they rejected or infringed this salutary and fundamental law The clergy may smile or groan at the presumption of a layman who defines the articles of faith yet if he stoops to the humiliating task his mind is less infected by prejudice or interest and the authority of the magistrate can only be maintained by the concord of the people It is in ecclesiastical story that Zeno appears less contemptible and I am not able to discern any Manichsan or Eutychian guilt in the generous saying of Anastasius that it was unworthy of an emperor to persecute the worshippers of Christ and the citizens of Rome The Henoticon was most pleasing to the Egyptians yet the smallest blemish has not been described by the jealous and even the jaundiced eyes of our orthodox schoolmen and it accurately represents the ca tholic faith of the incarnation without adopting or disclaiming the peculiar terms or tenets of the hostile sects A solemn anathema is pronounced against Nestorius and Eutyches against all heretics by whom Christ is divided or confounded or reduced to a phantom Without defining the number or the article of the word nature the pure system of St Cyril the faith of Nice Constantinople and Ephe sus is respectfully confirmed but instead of bowing at the name of the fourth council the subject is dismissed by the censure of all contrary doctrines if any such have been taught either elsewhere or at Chalcedon Under this ambiguous expression the friends and enemies of the last synod might unite in a silent em brace The most reasonable Christians acquiesced in this mode of toleration but their reason was feeble and inconstant and their obedience was despised as timid and servile by the vehement spirit of their brethren On

been gradually adopted by the catholics of the east and west But it had been imagined by a Monophy site bishop l the gift of an enemy was at first rejected as a dire and dangerous blasphemy and the rash innovation had nearly cost the emperor Anastasius his throne and his life 2 The people of Constantinople were devoid of any rational principles of freedom but they held as a lawful cause of rebellion the colour of a livery in the races or the colour of a mystery in the schools The Trisagion with and without this ob noxious addition was chanted in the cathedral by two adverse choirs and when their lungs were exhausted they had recourse to the more solid arguments of sticks and stones the aggressors were punished by the emperor and defended by the patriarch and the crown and the mitre were staked on the event of this mo mentous quarrel The streets were instantly crowded with innumerable swarms of men women and children the legions of monks in regular array marched and shouted and fought at their head â Christians this is the day of martyr dom let us not desert our spiritual father anathema to the Manichscan tyrant he is unworthy to reign Such was the catholic cry and the galleys of Anastasius lay upon their oars before the palace till the patriarch had pardoned his penitent and hushed the waves of the troubled multitude The triumph of Macedonius was checked by a speedy exile but the zeal of his flock was again exasperated by the same question â Whether one of the Trinity had been crucified On this momentous occasion the blue and green factionsof Constantinople suspended their discord and the civil and military powers were annihilated in their presence The keys of the city and the standards of their guards were deposited in the forum of Constantine the principal station and camp of the faithful Day and night they were incessantly busied either in singing hymns to the honour of their god or in pillaging and murdering the servants of their prince The head of his fa vourite monk the friend as they styled him of the enemy of the holy Trinity was borne aloft on a spear and the fire brands which had been darted against he retical structures diffused the undistinguishing flames against the most orthodox buildings The statues of the emperor were broken and his person was concealed in a suburb till at the end of three days he dared to implore the mercy of his sub jects Without his diadem and in the posture of a suppliant Anastasius appeared on the throne of the circus The catholics before his face rehearsed their ge nuine Trisagion they exulted in the offer which he proclaimed by the voice of a herald of abdicating the purple they listened to the admonition that since all could not reign they should previously agree in the choice of a sovereign and they accepted the blood of two unpopular ministers whom their master without hesitation condemned to the lions These furious but transient seditions were en couraged by the success of Vitalian who with an army of Huns and Bulgarians for the most part idolaters declared himself the champion of the catholic faith In this pious rebellion he depopulated Thrace besieged Constantinople extermi nated sixty five thousand of his fellow Christians till he obtained the recall of the bishops the satisfaction of the pope and the establishment of the council of Chalcedon an

218 THE DECLINE AND FALL Justinian has been already seen in the various lights of a prince a conqueror and a law giver the theologian l still remains and it afl ords an unfavourable prejudice that his theology should form a very prominent feature of his portrait The sovereign sympathized with his subjects in their superstitious reverence for  living and departed saints his code and more especially his novels confirm and enlarge the privileges of the clergy and in every dispute between a monk and a layman the partial judge was inclined to pronounce that truth and innocence and justice were always on the side of the church In his public and private de votions the emperor was assiduous and exemplary his prayers vigils and fasts displayed the austere penance of a monk his fancy was amused by the hope or belief of personal inspiration he had secured the patronage of the Virgin and St Michael the archangel and his recovery from a dangerous disease was ascribed to the miraculous succour of the holy martyrs Cosmas and Damian The capital and the provinces of the east were decorated with themonuments of his religion 2 and though the far greater part of these costly structures may be attributed to his taste or ostentation the zeal of the royal architect was probably quickened by a genuine sense of love and gratitude towards his invisible benefactors Among the titles of imperial greatness the name of Pious was most pleasing to his ear to pro mote the temporal and spiritual interests of the church was the serious business of his life and the duty of father of his country was often sacrificed to that of de fender of the faith The controversies of the times were congenial to his temper and understanding and the theological professors must inwardly deride the dili gence of a stranger who cultivated their art and neglected his own  What can ye fear said a bold conspirator to his associates  from your bigoted tyrant Sleepless and unarmed he sits whole nights in his closet debating with reverend gray beards and turning over the pages of ecclesiastical volumes 3 The fruits of these lucubrations were displayed in many a conference where Justinian might shine as the loudest and most subtle of the disputants in many a sermon which under the name of edicts and epistles proclaimed to the empire the theology of their master While the barbarians invaded the provinces while the victorious legions marched under the banners of Belisarius and Narses the successor of Trajan unknown to the camp was content to vanquish at the head of a synod Had he invited to these synods a disinterested and rational spectator Justinian might have learned that re ligious controversy is the offspring of arrogance and folly that true piety is most laudably expressed by silence and submission that man ignorant of his own na ture should not presume to scrutinize the nature of his God and that it is suffi cient for us to know that power and benevolence are the perfect attributes of the Deity 4 Toleration was not the virtue of the times and indulgence to rebels has seldom been the virtue of princes But when the prince descends to the narrow and peevish character of a disputant he is easily provoked to supply the defect of ar gument by the plenitude of power and to chastise without mercy the perverse blindness of those who wilfully shut their eyes against the light of demonstration The reign of Justinian was a uniform yet various scene of persecution and he ap pears to have surpassed his indolent predecessors both in the contrivance of his laws and the rigour of their execution The insufficient term of three months was assigned for the conversion or exile of all heretics 5 and if he still connived at their precarious stay they were deprived under his iron yoke not only of the benefits of society but of the common birth right of men and Christians At the 1 Tlie strain of the Anecdotes of Prooopius c 11 13 18 27 28 with the learned remarks on Aleman jhiÂ

the special organs of the Paraclete On the approach of the catholic priests and soldiers they grasped with alacrity the crown of martyrdom the conventicle and the congregation perished in the flames but these primitive fanatics were not extinguished three hundred years after the death of their tyrant Under the protection of the Gothic confederates the church of the Arians of Constantinople had braved the severity of the laws their clergy equalled the wealth a l magnificence of the senate and the gold and silver which were seized by the rapacious hand of Justinian might perhaps be claimed as the spoils of the provinces and the trophies of the barbarians A second remnant of pagans who still lurked in the most refined and the most rustic conditions of mankind excited the indignation of the Christians who were perhaps unwilling that any strangers should be the witnesses of their intestine quarrels A bishop was named as the inquisitor of the faith and his diligence soon discovered in the court and city the magistrates lawyers physicians and sophists who still cherished the superstition of the Greeks They were sternly informed that they must choose without delay between the displeasure of Jupiter or Justinian and that their aversion to the gos pel could no longer be disguised under the scandalous mask of indifference or im piety The patrician Photius perhaps alone was resolved to live and to die like his ancestors he enfranchised himself with the stroke of a dagger and left his tyrant the poor consolation of exposing with ignominy the lifeless corpse of the fugitive His weaker brethren submitted to their earthly monarch underwent the cere mony of baptism and laboured by their extraordinary zeal to erase the suspicion or to expiate the guilt of idolatry The native country of Homer and the thea tre of the Trojan war still retained the last sparks of his mythology by the care of the same bishop seventy thousand pagans were detected and converted in Asia Phrygia Lydia and Caria ninety six churches were built for the new proselytes and linen vestments Bibles and liturgies and vases of gold and silver were sup plied by the pious munificence of Justinian 2 The Jews who had been gradually stripped of their immunities were oppressed by a vexatious law which compelled them to observe the festival of Easter the same day on which is was celebrated by the Christians 3 And they might complain with the more reason since the catholics themselves did not agree with the astronomical calculations of their so vereign the people of Constantinople delayed the beginning of their Lent a whole week after it had been ordained by authority and they had the pleasure of fasting seven days while meat was exposed for sale by the command of the emperor The Samaritans of Palestine 4 were a motley race an ambiguous sect rejected as Jews by the pagans by the Jews as schismatics and by the Christians as idola ters The abomination of the cross had already been planted on their holy mount of Garizim 5 but the persecution of Justinian offered only the alternative of bap tism or rebellion They chose the latter under the standard of a desperate leader they rose in arms and retaliated their wrongs on the lives the property and the temples of a defenceless people The Samaritans were finally subdued by the regular forces of the east twenty thousand were slain twenty thousand were sold by the Arabs to the infidels of Persia and India and the remains of that unhappy nation atoned for the crime of treason by the sin of hypocrisy It has been computed that one hundred thousand Roman subjects were extirpated in the Samaritan war 6 which converted the once fruitful province into a desolate and smoking wilderness But in the creed of Justinian the guilt of murder could

on either side to the double edge of persecution and the four synods of Nice Constantinople Ephesus and Chalcedony â were ratified by the code of a catholic lawgiver 2 But while Justinian strove to maintain the uniformity of faith and worship his wife Theodora whose vices were not incompatible with devotion had listened to the Monophysite teachers and the open or clandestine enemies of the church revived and multiplied at the smile of their gracious patroness The capital the palace the nuptial bed were torn by spiritual discord yet so doubtful was the sincerity of the royal consorts that their seeming disagreement was imputed by many to a secret and mischievous confederacy against the religion and happiness of their people 3 The famous dispute of the three chapters 4 which has filled more volumes than it de serves lines is deeply marked with this subtle and disingenuous spirit It was now three hundred years since the body of Origen 5 had been eaten by the worms his soul of which he held the pre existence was in the hands of its Cre ator but his writings were eagerly perused by the monks of Palestine In these writings the piercing eye of Justinian descried more than ten metaphysical errors and the primitive doctor in the company of Pythagoras and Plato was devoted by the clergy to the eternity of hell fire which he had presumed to deny Under the cover of this precedent a treacherous blow was aimed at the council of Chalcedon The fathers had listened without impatience to the praise of Theo dore of Mopsuestia 6 and their justice or indulgence had restored both Theo doret of Cyrrhus and Ibas of Edessa to the communion of the church But the characters of these oriental bishops were tainted with the reproach of heresy the first had been the master the two others were the friends of Nestorius their most suspicious passages were accused under the title of the three chapters and the condemnation of their memory must involve the honour of a synod whose name was pronounced with sincere or affected reverence by the catholic world If these bishops whether innocent or guilty were annihilated in the sleep of death they would not probably be awakened by the clamour which after a hundred years was raised over their grave If they were already in the fangs of the demon their torments could neither be aggravated nor assuaged by human industry If in the company of saints and angels they enjoyed the rewards of piety they must have smiled at the idle fury of the theological insects who still crawled on the surface of the earth The foremost of these insects the emperor of the Romans darted his sting and distilled his venom perhaps without discerning the true mo tives of Theodora and her ecclesiastical faction The victims were no longer subject to his power and the vehement style nf his edicts could only proclaim their damnation and invite the clergy of the east to join in a full chorus of curses and anathemas The east with some hesitation

of the ene my the throne of St Peter which had been disgraced by the simony was be trayed by the cowardice of Vigilius who yielded after a long and inconsistant struggle to the despotism of Justinian and the sophistry of the Greeks His apostacy provoked the indignation of the Latins and no more than two bishops could be found who would impose their hands on his deacon and successor Pela gius Yet the perseverance of the popes insensibly transferred to their adversa ries the appellation of schismatics the Illyrian African and Italian churches were oppressed by the civil and ecclesiastical powers not without some effort of military force l the distant barbarians transcribed the creed of the Vatican and in the period ot a century the schism of the three chapters expired in an obscure angle of the Venetian province 2 But the religious discontent of the Italians had already promoted the conquests of the Lombards and the Romans them selves were accustomed to suspect the faith and to detest the government of their Byzantine tyrant Justinian was neither steady nor consistent in the nice process of fixing his vola tile opinions and those of his subjects In his youth he was offended by the slightest deviation from the orthodox line in his old age he transgressed the mea sure of temperate heresy and the Jacobites not less than the catholics were scandalized oy his declaration that the body of Christ was incorruptible and that his manhood was never subject to any wants and infirmities the inheritance of our mortal flesh This fantastic opinion was announced in the last edicts of Justinian and at the moment of his seasonable departure the clergy had refused to tran scribe the prince was prepared to persecute and the people were resolved to suf fer or resist A bishop of Treves

cious enemy The orthodox the prevailing party devised new modes of speech and argument and interpretation to their nature of Christ they preciously ap plied a proper and distant energy but the difference was no longer visible when they allowed that the human and the divine will were invariably the same 1 The disease was attended with the customary symptoms but the Greek clergy as if satiated with the endless controversy of the incarnation instilled a healing coun sel into the ear of the prince and people They declared themselves monothe lites assertors of the unity of will but they treated the words as new the questions as superfluous and recommended a religious silence as the most agree able to the prudence and charity of the gospel This law of silence was suc cessively imposed by the ecthesis or exposition of Heraclius the type or model of his grandson Constans 2 and the imperfect edicts were subscribed with alacrity or reluctance by the four patriarchs of Rome Constantinople Alexandria and Antioch But the bishop and monks of Jerusalem sounded the alarm in the lan guage or even in the silence of the Greeks the Latin churches detected a latent heresy and the obedience of pope Honorius to the commands of his sovereign was retracted and censured by the bolder ignorance of his successors They condemned the execrable and abominable heresy of the Monothelites who re vived the errors of Manes Apollinaris Eutyches c they signed the sentence of excommunication on the tomb of St Peter the ink was mingled with the sacra mental wine the blood of Christ and no ceremony was omitted that could fill the superstitious mind with horror and affright As the representative of the western church pope Martin and his Lateran synod anathematized the perfidious and guilty silence of the Greeks one hundred and five bishops of Italy for the most part the subjects of Constans presumed to reprobate his wicked tyfie and the im pious ecthesis of his grandfather and to confound the authors and their adherents with the twenty one notorious heretics the apostates from the church and the or gans of the devil Such an insult under the tamest reign could not pass with im punity Pope Martin ended his days on the inhospitable shore of the Tauric Chersonesus and his oracle the abbot Maximus was inhumanly chastised by the amputation of his tongue and his right hand 3 But the same invincible spirit survived in their successors and the triumph of the Latins avenged their recent defeat and obliterated the disgrace of the three chapters The synods of Rome were confirmed by the sixth general council of Constantinople in the palace and the presence of a new Constantine a descendant of Heraclius The royal con vert converted the Byzantine pontiff and a majority of the bishops 4 the dis senters with their chief Macarius of Antioch were condemned to the spiritual and temporal pains of heresy the east condescended to accept the lessons of the west and the creed was finally settled which teaches the catholics of every age that two wills or energies are harmonized in the person of Christ The majesty of the pope and the Roman synod was represented by two priests one deacon and three bishops but these obscure Latins had neither arms to compel nor treasures to bribe nor language to persuade and I am ignorant by what arts they could de termine the lofty emperor

prelates assisted at the trial but the acknowledged failure may serve to indicate that the passions and prejudices of the multitude were not enlisted on the side of the Monothelites In the next generation when the son of Const an tine was deposed and slain by the disciple of Macarius they tasted the feast of revenge and dominion the image or monument of the sixth council was defaced and the original acts were committed to the flames But in the second year their patron was cast headlong from the throne the bishops of the east were released from their occasional conformity the Roman faith was more firmly replanted by the orthodox successors of Bardanes and the fine problems of the incarnation were forgotten in the more popular and visible quarrel of the worship of images 1 Before the end of the seventh century the creed of the incarnation which had been defined at Rome and Constantinople was uniformly preached in the remote islands of Britain and Ireland 2 the same ideas were entertained or rather the same words were repeated by all the Christians whose liturgy was performed in the Greek or the Latin tongue Their numbers and visible splendour bestowed an imperfect claim to the appellation of catholics but in the east they were marked with the less honourable name of Melchites or royalists 3 of men whose faith instead of resting on the basis of Scripture reason or tradition had been established and was still maintained by the arbitrary power of a temperal mo narch Their adversaries might allege the words of the fathers of Constanti nople who profess themselves the slaves of the king and they might relate with malicious joy how the decrees of Chalcedon had been inspired and re formed by the emperor Marcian and his virgin bride The prevailing faction will naturally inculcate the duty of submission nor is it less natural that dissenters should feel and assert the principles of freedom Under the rod of persecution the Nestorians and Monophysites degenerated into rebels and fugitives and the most ancient and useful allies of Rome were taught to consider the emperor not as the chief but as the enemy of the Christians Language the leading principle which unites or separates the tribes of mankind soon discriminated the sectaries of the east by a peculiar and perpetual badge which abolished the means of intercourse and the hope of reconciliation The long dominion of the Greeks their colonies and above all their eloquence had propagated a language doubtless the most Eerfect that has been contrived by the art of man Yet the body of the people oth in Syria and Egpyt still persevered in the use of their national idioms with this difference however that the Coptic was confined to the rude and illiterate Seasants of the Nile while the Syriac 4 from the mountains of Assyria to the ed Sea was adapted to the higher topics of poetry and argument Armenia and Abyssinia were infected by the speech or learning of the Greeks and

been revived in the studies of modern Europe were un intelligible to the inhabitants of the Roman empire The Syriac and the Coptic the Armenian and the Ethiopic are consecrated in the service of their respective churches and their theology is enriched by domestic versions l both of the Scriptures and of the most popular fathers After a period of thirteen hundred and sixty years the spark of controversy first kindled by a sermon of Nestorius still burns in the bosom of the east and the hostile communions still maintain the faith and discipline of their founders In the most abject state of ignorance po verty and servitude the Nestorians and Monophysites reject the spiritual supre macy of Rome and cherish the toleration of their Turkish masters which allows them to anathematise on one hand St Cyril and the synod of Ephesus on the other pope Leo and the council of Chalcedon The weight which they cast into the downfall of the eastern empire demands our notice and the reader may be amused with the various prospects of I The Nestorians II The Jacobites 2 III The Maronites IV The Armenians V The Copts and VI The Abyssinians To the three former the Syriac is common but of the latter each is discrimi nated by the use of a national idiom Yet the modern natives of Armenia and Abyssinia would be incapable of conversing with their ancestors and the Chris tians of Egypt and Syria who reject the religion have adopted the language of the Arabians The lapse of time has seconded the sacerdotal arts and in the east as well as in the west the Deity is addressed in an obsolete tongue unknown to the majority of the congregation I Both in his native and his episcopal province the heresy of the unfortunate Nestorius was speedily obliterated The oriental bishops who at Ephesus had resisted to his face the arrogance of Cyril were mollified by his tardy concessions The same prelates or their successors subscribed not without a murmur the de crees of Chalcedon the power of the Monophysites reconciled them with the catholics in the conformity of passion of interest and insensibility of belief and their last reluctant sigh was breathed in the defence of the three chapters Their dissenting brethren less moderate or more sincere were crushed by the penal laws and as early as the reign of Justinian it became difficult to find a church of Nestorians within the limits of the Roman empire Beyond those limits they had discovered a new world in which they might hope for liberty and aspire to con quest In Persia notwithstanding the resistance of the Magi Christianity had struck a deep root and the nations of the east reposed under its salutary shade The catholic or primate resided in the capital in his synods and in their dio cesses his metropolitans bishops and clergy represented the pomp and honour of a regular hierarchy they rejoiced in the increase of proselytes who were con verted from the Zendavesta to the gospel from the secular to the monastic life and their zeal was stimulated by the presence of an artful and formidable enemy The Persian church had been founded by the missionaries of Syria and their lan guage discipline and doctrine were closely interwoven with its original frame The catholics were elected and ordained by their own suffragans but their filial dependance on the patriarchs of Antioch is attested by the canons of the oriental church S In the Persian school of Edessa 4 the rising generations of the faith ful imbibed their theological idiom they studied in the Syriac version the ten thousand volumes of Theodore of Mopsuestia and they revered the apostolic faith 0 I shall not enrich ray ignorance with the spoilt of Simon Walton Mill Wetstein Assemannus LudoT phus La Croze whom I have consulted with some care It appears 1 That of all the versions which are ce lebrated by the fathers it is doubtful whether any are now extant in their pristine integrity 2 That the Sy riac has the best claim and that the consent of the oriental sects is a proof that it is more ancient than their schism 2 On the account of the Monophysites and Nestorians 1 am deeply indebted to the Bibliotheca Orientalis Clementino Vaticana of Joseph Simon Assemannus That learned Maronite was despatched in the year 1715 by pope Clement XI to visit the monasteries of Egypt and Syria in search of MSS His four folio volumes published at Rome

beyond the Tigris The first indelible lesson of Ibas bishop of Edessa taught them to execrate the Â gyfitiant who in the synod of Ephesus had impiously confounded the two natures of Christ The flight of the masters and scholars who were twice expelled from the Athens of Syria dis persed a crowd of missionaries inflamed by the double zeal of religion and revenge And the rigid unity of the Monophysites who under the reigns of Zeno and Anastasius had invaded the thrones of the east provoked their antagonists in a land of freedom to avow a moral rather than a physical union of the twO persons of Christ Since the first preaching of the gospel the Sassanian kings beheld with an eye of suspicion a race of aliens and apostates who had embraced the religion and who might favour the cause of the hereditary foes of their country The royal edicts had often prohibited their dangerous correspondence with the Syrian clergy the progress of the schism was grateful to the jealous pride of Pe rozes and he listened to the eloquence of an artful prelate who painted Nestorius as the friend of Persia and urged him to secure the fidelity of his Christian sub jects by granting a just preference to the victims and enemies of the Roman ty rant The Nestorians composed a large majority of the clergy and people they were encouraged by the smde and armed with the sword of despotism yet many of their weaker brethren were startled at the thought of breaking loose from the communion of the Christian world and the blood of seven thousand seven hundred Monophysites or catholics confirmed the uniformity of faith and discipline in the churches of Persia 1 Their ecclesiastical institutions are distinguished by a liberal principle of reason or at least of policy the austerity of the cloister was relaxed and gradually forgotten houses of charity were endowed for the educa tion of orphans and foundlings the law of celibacy so forcibly recommended to the Greeks and Latins was disregarded by the Persian clergy and the number of the elect was multiplied by the public and reiterated nuptials of the priests the bishops and even the patriarch himself To this standard of natural and religious freedom myriads of fugitives resorted from all the provinces of the eastern em pire the narrow bigotry of Justinian was punished by the emigration of his most industrious subjects they transported into Persia the arts both of peace and war and those who deserved the favour were promoted in the service of a discerning monarch The arms of Nushirvan and his fiercer grandson were assisted with ad vice and money and troops by the desperate sectaries who still lurked in their native cities of the east their zeal was rewarded with the gift of the catholic churches but when those cities and churches were recovered by Heraclius their open profession of treason and heresy compelled them to seek a refuge in the realm of their foreign ally But the seeming tranquillity of the Nestorians was often endangered and sometimes overthrown They were involved in the com mon evils of oriental despotism their enmity to Rome could not always atone for their attachment to the gospel and a colony of three hundred thousand Jacobites the captives of Apamea and Antioch was permitted to erect a hostile altar in the face of the catholic and in the sunshine of the court In his last treaty Justinian introduced some conditions which tended to enlarge and fortify the toleration of Christianity in Persia The emperor ignorant of the rights of conscience was incapable of pity or esteem for the heretics who denied the authority of the holy synods but he flattered himself that they would gradually perceive the temporal benefits of union with the empire and the church of Rome and if he failed in ex citing their gratitude he might hope to provoke the jealousy of their sovereign In a later age the Lutherans have been burnt at Paris and protected in Germa ny by the superstition and policy of the most Christian king The desire of gaining souls for God and subjects for the church has excited in every age the diligence of the Christian priests From the conquest of Persia they carried their spiritual arms to the north the east and the south and the sim plicity of the gospel was fashioned and painted with the colours of the Syriac the ology In the sixth century

Medes and the Elamites the barbaric churches from the gulf of Persia to the Caspian sea were almost infinite and their recent faith was conspicuous in the number and sanctity of their monks and martyrs The pepper coast of Malabar and the isles of the ocean Socotora and Ceylon were peopled with an increasing multitude of Christians and the bishops and clergy of those sequestered regions derived their ordination from the catholic of Babylon In a subsequent age the zeal of the Nestorians overleaped the limits which had confined the ambition and curiosity both of the Greeks and Persians The missionaries of Balch and Samarcand pursued without fear the footsteps of the roving Tartar and insinuated themselves into the camps of the valleys of Imaus and the banks of the Selinga They exposed a metaphysical creed to those illite rate shepherds to those sanguinary warriors they recommended humanity and re pose Yet a Khan whose power they vainly magnified is said to have received at their hands the rites of baptism and even of ordination and the fame of fires tor or firesbyter John l has long amused the credulity of Europe The royal convert was indulged in the use of a portable altar but he despatched an embassy to the patriarch to inquire how in the season of lent he should abstain from ani mal food and how he might celebrate the Eucharist in a desert that produced nei ther corn nor wine In their progress by sea and land the Nestorians entered China by the port of Canton and the northern residence of Sigan Unlike the senators of Rome who assumed with a smile the characters of priests and augurs the man darins who affect in public the reason of philosophers are devoted in private to every mode of popular superstition They cherished and they confounded the gods of Palestine and of India but the propagation of Christianity awakened the jealousy of the state and after a short vicissitude of favour and persecution the foreign sect expired in ignorance and oblivion 2 Under the reign of the caliphs the Nestorian church was diffused from China to Jerusalem and Cyprus and their numbers with those of the Jacobites were computed to surpass the Greek and Latin communions 3 Twenty five metropolitans or archbishops composed their hierarchy but several of these were dispensed by the distance and danger of the way from the duty of personal attendance on the easy condition that every six years they should testify their faith and obedience to the catholic or patriarch of Babylon a vague appellation which has been successively applied to the royal seats

of eastern antiquity According to the legend of antiquity the gospel was preached in India by St Thomas 1 At the end of the ninth century his shrine perhaps in the neigh bourhood of Madras was devoutly visited by the ambassadors of Alfred and their return with a cargo of pearls and spices rewarded the zeal of the English monarch who entertained the largest projects of trade and discovery 2 When the Por tuguese first opened the navigation of India the Christians of St Thomas had been seated for ages on the coast of Malabar and the difference of their character and colour attested the mixture of a foreign race In arms in arts and possibly in vir tue they excelled the natives of Hindostan the husbandman cultivated the palm tree the merchants were enriched by the pepper trade the soldiers preceded the naira or nobles of Malabar and their hereditary privileges were respected by the gratitude or the fear of the king of Cochin and the Zamorin himself They ac knowledged a Gentoo sovereign but they were governed even in temporal con cerns by the bishop of Angamala He still asserted his ancient title of Metropo litan of India but his real jurisdiction was exercised in fourteen hundred churches and he was intrusted with the care of two hundred thousand souls Their reli gion would have rendered them the firmest and most cordial allies of the Portu guese but the inquisitors soon discerned in the Christians of St Thomas the unpardonable guilt of heresy and schism Instead of owning themselves the sub jects of the Roman pontiff the spiritual and temporal monarch of the globe they adhered like their ancestors to the communion of the Nestorian patriarch and the bishops whom he ordained at Mosul traversed the dangers of the sea and land to reach their diocesses on the coast of Malabar In their Syriac liturgy the names of Theodore and Nestorius were piously commemorated they united their adoration of the two persons of Christ the title of Mother of God was offen sive to their ear and they measured with scrupulous avarice the honours of the Virgin Mary whom the superstition of the Latins had almost exalted to the rank of a goddess When her image was first presented to the disciples of St Thomas they indignantly exclaimed We are Christians not ido laters and their simple devotion was content with the veneration of the cross Their separation from the western world had left them in ignorance of the im provements or corruptions of a thousand years and their conformity with the faith and practice of the fifth century would equally disappoint the preju dices of a papist or a protestant It was the first care of the ministers of Rome to intercept all correspondence with the Nestorian patriarch and several of his bishops expired in the prisons of the holy office The flock without a shep herd was assaulted by the power of the Portuguese the arts of the Jesuits and the zeal of Alexes de Menezes archbishop of Goa in his personal visitation of the coast of Malabar The synod of Diamper at which he presided consummated the pious work of the reunion and rigorously imposed the doctrine and discipline of the Roman church without forgetting auricular confession the strongest engine of ecclesiastical torture The memory of Theodore and Nestorius was condemned and Malabar was reduced under the dominion of the pope of the primate and of the Jesuits who invaded the see of Angamala or Cranganor Sixty years of ser vitude and hypocrisy were patiently endured but as soon as the Portuguese empire was shaken by the courage and industry of the Dutch the Nestorians asserted â with vigour and effect the religion of their fathers The Jesuits were incapable of defending the power which they had abused the arms of forty thousand Chris tians were pointed

liar who spoke the truth 2 But the approxima tion of ideas could not abate the vehemence of passion each party was the more astonished that their blind antagonist could dispute on so trifling a

ambiguous favour of Theodora the oriental flocks deprived of their shepherds must insensibly have been either famished or poisoned In this spiritual distress the expiring faction was revived and united and perpetuated by the labours of a monk and the name of James Baradseus 6 has been preserved in the appellation of Jacobites a familiar sound which may startle the ear of an English reader From the holy confessors in their prison of Constantinople he received the powers of bishop of Edessa and apostle of the east and the ordination of fourscore thousand bishops priests and deacons is de

Orontes On the controversies of the incarnation they nicely threaded the orthodox line between the sects of Nestorius and Eutyches but the unfortunate question of one will or operation in the two natures of Christ was ge nerated by their curious leisure Their proselyte the emperor Heraclius was rejected as a Maronite from the walls of Emesa he found a refuge in the monas tery of his brethren and their theological lessons were repaid with the gift of a spacious and wealthy domain The name and doctrine of this venerable school were propagated among the Greeks and Syrians and their zeal is expressed by Macarius patriarch of Antioch who declared before the synod of Constantinople that sooner than subscribe the two wills of Christ he would submit to be hewn piecemeal and cast into the sea

orthodox Constantino pursued with pious hatred a people of soldiers who might have stood the bulwark of his empire against the common foes of Christ and of Rome An army of Greeks invaded Syria the monastery of St Maron was destroyed with fire the bravest chieftains were be trayed and murdered and twelve thousand of their followers were transplanted to the distant frontiers of Armenia and Thrace Yet the humble nation of the Ma ronites has survived the empire of Constantinople and they still enjoy under their Turkish masters a free religion and a mitigated servitude Their domestic go vernors

Maronites abjuring the Mono thelite error were reconciled to the Latin churches of Antioch and Rome 2 and the same alliance has been frequently renewed by the ambition of the popes and the distress of the Syrians But it may reasonably be questioned whether their union has ever been perfect or sincere and the learned Maronites of the college of Rome havei vainly laboured to absolve their ancestors from the guilt of heresy and schism 3 IV Since the age of Constantine the Armenians 4 had signalized their at tachment to the religion and empire of the Christian s The disorders of their country and their ignorance of the Greek tongue prevented their clergy from as sisting at the synod of Chalcedon and they floated eighty four years 5 in a state of indifference or suspense till their vacant faith was finally occupied by the mis sionaries of Julian of Halicarnassus 6 who in Egypt their common exile had been vanquished by the arguments or the influence of his rival Severus the Mo nephysite

present hour Armenia has been the theatre of perpetual war the lands between Taurus and Erivan were dispeopled by the cruel policy of the So phies and myriads of Christian families were transplanted to perish or to propa gate in the distant provinces of Persia Under the rod of oppression the zeal of the Armenians is fervent and intrepid they have often preferred the crown of martyrdom to the white turban of Mahomet they devoutly hate the error and idolatry of the Greeks and their transient union with the Latins is not less devoid of truth than the thousand bishops whom their patriarch offered at the feet of the Roman pontiff 1 The catholic or patriarch of the Armenians resides in the monastery of Ekmiasin three leagues from Erivan Forty seven archbishops each of whom may claim the obedience of four or five suffragans are consecrated by his hand but the far greater part are only titular prelates who dignify with their presence and service the simplicity of his court As soon as they have per formed the liturgy they cultivate the garden and our bishops will hear with sur prise that the austerity of their life increases in just proportion to the elevation of their rank In the fourscore thousand towns or villages of his spiritual empire the patriarch receives a small and voluntary tax from each person above the age of fif teen but the annual amount of six hundred thousand crowns is insufficient to sup ply the incessant demands of charity and tribute Since the beginning of the last century the Armenians have obtained a large and lucrative share of the com merce of the east in their return from Europe the caravan usually halts in the neighbourhood of Erivan the altars are enriched with the fruits of their patient industry and the faith of EutycheS is preached in their recent congregations of Barbary and Poland 2 V In the rest of the Roman empire the despotism of the prince might eradi cate or silence the sectaries of an obnoxious creed But the stubborn temper of the Egyptians maintained their opposition to the synod of Chalcedon and the policy of Justinian condescended to expect and to seize the opportunity of discord The Mo nophysite church of Alexandria 3 was torn by the disputes of the corrufitibles and incorrufitibles and on the death of the patriarch the two factions upheld their respective candidates 4 Gaian was the disciple of Julian Theodosius had been the pupil of Severus the claims of the former were supported by the consent of the monks and senators of the city and the province the latter depended on the priority of his ordination the favour of the empress Theodora and the arms of the eunuch Narses which might have been used in more honourable warfare The exile of the popular candidate to Carthage and Sardinia inflamed the ferment of Alexandria and after a schism of one hundred and seventy years the Gaian ites still revered the memory and doctrine of their founder The strength of num bers and of discipline was tried in a desperate and bloody conflict the streets were filled with the dead bodies of citizens and soldiers the pious women ascending the roofs of the houses showered down every sharp or ponderous utensil on the heads of the enemy and the final victory of Narses was owing to the flames with which he wasted the third capital of the Roman world But the lieutenant of Justinian  had not conquered in the cause of a heretic Theodosius himself was speedily though gently removed and Paul of Tanis an orthodox monk was raised to the throne of Anastasius The powers of government were strained in his support he might appoint or displace the dukes and tribunes of Egypt the allowance of bread which Diocletian had granted was suppressed the churches were shut and a nation of schismatics was deprived at once of their spiritual and carnal food In his turn the tyrant was excommunicated by the zeal and revenge of the people and none except his servile Melchites would salute him as a man a Christian or a bishop Yet such is the blindness of ambition that when Paul was expelled on a charge of murder he solicited with a bribe of seven hundred pounds of gold his restoration to the same station of hatred and

tome of St Leo than a volley of curses and invectives and stones assaulted the odious minister of the emperor and the synod A charge was instantly sounded by the successor of the apostles the soldiers waded to their knees in blood and two hundred thousand Christians are said to have fallen by the sword an incredible account even if it be extended from the slaughter of a day to the eighteen years of the reign of Apollinaris Two suc ceeding patriarchs Eulogius l and John 2 laboured in the conversion of heretics with arms and arguments more worthy of their evangelical profession The theo logical knowledge of Eulogius was displayed in many a volume which magnified the errors of Eutyches and Severus and attempted to reconcile the ambiguous lan guage of St Cyril with the orthodox creed of pope Leo and the fathers of Chal cedon The bounteous alms of John the eleemosynary were dictated by super stition or benevolence or policy Seven thousand five hundred poor were main tained at his expense on his accession he found eight thousand pounds of gold in the treasury ot the church he collected ten thousand for the liberality of the faithful yet the primate could boast in his testament that he left behind him no more than the third part of the smallest of the silver coins The churches of Alexandria were delivered to the catholics the religion of the Monophysites was proscribed in Egypt and a law was revived which excluded the natives from the honours and emoluments of the state A more important conquest still remained of the patriarch the oracle and leader of the Egyptian church Theodosius had resisted the threats and promises of Justinian with the spirit of an apostle or an enthusiast  Such replied the pa triarch were the offers of the tempter when he showed the kingdoms of

now and for evermore Naked came I out of my mother s womb naked shall I descend into the grave Let those who love God follow me and seek their salvation After comforting his brethren he embarked for Constantinople and sustained in six successive interviews the almost irresistible weight of the royal presence His opinions were favourably entertained in the palace and the city the influence of Theodora assured him a safe conduct and honourable dismission and he ended his days though not on the throne yet in the bosom of his native country On the news of his death Apollinaris indecently feasted the nobles and clergy but his joy was checked by the intelligence of a new election and while he enjoyed the wealth of Alexandria his rivals reigned in the monasteries of The bais and were maintained by the voluntary oblations of the people A perpetual succession of patriarchs arose from the ashes of Theodosius and the Monophy site churches of Syria and Egypt were united by the name of Jacobites and the communion of the faith But the same faith which has been confined to a nar row sect of the Syrians was diffused over the mass of the Egyptian or Coptic na tion who almost unanimously rejected the decrees of the synod of Chalcedon A thousand years were now elapsed since Egypt had ceased to be a kingdom since the conquerors of Asia and Europe had trampled on the ready necks of a people whose ancient wisdom and power ascend beyond the records of history The con flict of zeal and persecution rekindled some sparks of their national spirit They abjured with a foreign heresy the

comfort or delight But experience has proved the distinction of active and passive courage the fanatic who endures without a groan the torture of the rack or the stake would tremble and fly before the face of an armed enemy The pusillanimous temper of the Egyptians could only hope for a change of masters the arms of Chosroes depopulated the land yet under his reign the Jacobites enjoyed a short and precarious respite The vic tory of Heraclius renewed and aggravated the persecution and the patriarch again escaped from Alexandria to the desert In his flight Benjamin was encouraged by a voice which bade him expect at the end of ten years the aid of a foreign nation marked like the Egyptians themselves with the ancient rite of circumci sion The character of these deliverers and the nature of the deliverance will be hereafter explained and I shall step over the interval of eleven centuries to observe the present misery of the Jacobites of Egypt The populous city of Cairo affords a residence or rather a shelter for their indigent patriarch and a remnant of ten bishops forty monasteries have survived the inroads of the Arabs and the Erogress of servitude and apostacy has reduced the Coptic nation to the despica le number of twenty five or thirty thousand families l a race of illiterate beg gars whose only consolation is derived from the superior wretchedness of the Greek patriarch and his diminutive congregation 2 VI The Coptic patriarch a rebel to the Cicsars or a slave to the khalifs still gloried in the filial obedience of the kings of Nubia and Ethiopia He repaid their â homage by magnifying their greatness and it was boldly asserted that they could bring into the field a hundred thousand horse with an equal number of camels 3 that their hand could pour out or restrain the waters of the Nile 4 and the peace and plenty of Egypt was obtained even in this world by the intercession of the patriarch In exile at Constantinople Theodosius recommended to his patroness the conversion of the black nations of Nubia 5 from the tropic of Cancer to the confines of Abyssinia Her design was suspected and emulated by the more or thodox emperor The rival missionaries a Melchite and a Jacobite embarked at the same time but the empress from a motive of love or fear was more effect ually obeyed and the catholic priest was detained by the president of Thebais while the king of Nubia and his court were hastily baptized in the faith of Diosco rus The tardy envoy of Justinian was received and dismissed with honour but when he accused the heresy and treason of the Egyptians the negro convert was instructed to reply that he would never abandon his brethren the true believers to the persecuting ministers of the synod of Chalcedon 6 During several ages the bishops of Nubia were named and consecrated by the Jacobite patriarch of Alexandria as late as the twelfth century Christianity prevailed and some rites some ruins are still visible in the savage towns of Sennaar and

Justinian and Theodora strove to outstrip each other in the conquest of a remote and independent province The industry of the empress was again victorious and the pious Theodora haB esta lished in that sequestered church the faith and discipline of the Jacobites 2 Encompassed on all sides by the enemies of their religion the Ethiopians slept near a thousand years forgetful of the world by whom they were forgotten They were awakened by the Portuguese who turning the southern promontory of Africa appeared in India and the Red Sea as if they had descended through the air from a distant planet In the first moments of their interview the subjects of Rome and Alexandria observed the resemblance rather than the difference of their faith and each nation expected the most important benefits from an alliance with their Christian brethren In their lonely situation the Ethiopians had almost relapsed into the savage life Their vessels which had traded to Ceylon scarcely presumed to navigate the rivers of Africa the ruins of Axume were deserted the nation was scattered in villages and the emperor a pompous name was content both in peace and war with the immoveable residence of a camp Conscious of their own indigence the Abyssinians had formed the rational project of importing the arts and ingenuity of Europe 3 and their ambassadors at Rome and Lisbon were instructed to solicit a colony of smiths carpenters tilers masons printers surgeons and physicians for the use of their country But the public danger soon called for the instant and effectual aid of arms and soldiers to defend an unwarlike people from the barbarians who ravaged the inland country and the Turks and Arabs who advanced from the sea coast in more formidable array Ethiopia was saved by four hundred and fifty Portuguese who displayed in the field the native valour of the Europeans and the artificial powers of musket and cannon In a moment of terror the emperor hadSpromised to reconcile himself and his subjects to the catholic faith a Latin patriarch represented the supremacy of the pope 4 the empire enlarged in a tenfold proportion was supposed to contain more gold than the mines of America and the wildest hopes of avarice and seal were built on the willing submission of the Christians of Africa But the vows which pain had extorted were foresworn on the return of health The Abyssinians still

death the enemies of Rome But the victorious monarch was finally subdued by the constancy of the nation of his mother of his son and of his most faithful friends Segued listened to the voice of pity

Succession and characters of the Greek emperors of Constantinople from the time of Heraclius to the Latin conquest I have now deduced from Trajan to Constantine from Constantine to Hera clius the regular series of the Roman emperors and faithfully exposed the pros perous and adverse fortunes of their reigns Five centuries of the decline and fall 6f the empire have already elapsed but a period of more than eight hundred years still separates me from the term of my labours the taking of Constantinople by the Turks Should I persevere in the same course should I observe the same measure a prolix and slender thread would be spun through many a volume nor would the patient reader find an adequate reward of instruction or amusement At every step as we sink deeper in the decline and fall of the eastern empire the annals of each succeeding reign would impose a more ungrateful and melancholy task These annals must continue to repeat a tedious and uniform tale of weak ness and misery the natural connexion of causes and events would be broken by frequent and hasty transitions and a minute accumulation of circumstances must destroy the light and effect of those general pictures which compose the use and ornament of a remote history From the time of Heraclius the Byzantine thea tre is contracted and darkened the line of empire which had been defined by the laws of Justinian and the arms of Belisarius recedes on all sides from our view the Roman name the proper subject of our inquiries is reduced to a narrow cor ner of Europe to the lonely suburbs of Constantinople and the fate of the Greek empire has been compared to that of the Rhine which loses itself in the sands before its waters can mingle with the ocean The scale of dominion is dimi nished to our view by the distance of time and place nor is the loss of external splendour compensated by the nobler gifts of virtue and genius In the last mo 4 ments of her decay Constantinople was doubtless more opulent and populous than Athens at her most flourishing era when a scanty sum ot six thousand talents or twelve hundred thousand pounds sterling was possessed by twenty one thousand male citizens of an adult age But each of these citizens was a freeman who dared to assert the liberty of his thoughts words and actions whose person and proper ty were guarded by equal law and who exercised his independent vote in the government of the republic Their numbers seem to be multiplied by the strong and various discriminations of character under the shield of freedom on the wings of emulation and vanity each Athenian aspired to the level of the national dignity from this commanding eminence some chosen spirits soared beyond the reac i of a vulgar eye and the chances of superior merit in a great and populous kingdom as they are proved by experience would excuse the computation of imaginary millions The territories of Athens Sparta and their allies do not exceed a moderate province of France or England but after the trophies of Sa lamis and Platiea they expand in our fancy to the gigantic size of Asia which had been trampled under the feet of the victorious Greeks But the subjects of the Byzantine empire who assume and dishonour the names both of Greeks and Romans present a dead uniformity of abject vices which are neither soft ened by the weakness of humanity nor animated by the vigour of memorable crimes The freemen of antiquity might repeat with generous enthusiasm the sentence of Homer that on the first day of his servitude the captive is deprived of one half of his manly virtue But the poet had only seen the effects of civil or domestic slavery nor could he foretel that the second moiety of manhood must be annihilated by the spiritual despotism which shackles not only the actions but even the thoughts of the prostrate votary By this double yoke the Greeks were oppressed under the successors of Heraclius the tyrant a law of eternal justice was degraded by the vices of his subjects and on the throne in the camp in the schools we search perhaps with fruitless diligence the names and charac ters that may deserve to be rescued from oblivion Nor are the defects of the subjects compensated by the skill and variety of the painters Of a space of eight hundred years the four first centuries are overspread with a cloud inter rupted by some faint and broken rays of historic light in the lives of the empe OF THE ROMAN EMfilRE X 37 rcrs from Maurice to Alexius Basil the Macedonian has alone been the theme of a separate work and the absence or loss or imperfection of cotemporary evi dence must be poorly supplied by the doubtful authority of more recent compilers The four last centuries are exempt from the reproach of penury and with the the Comnenian family the historic muse of Constantinople again revives but her apparel is gaudy her motions are without elegance or grace A succession of priests or courtiers treads in each other s footsteps in the same path of servitude and superstition their views are narrow their judgment is feeble or corrupt and we close the volume of copious barrenness still ignomnt of the causes of events the characters of the actors and the manners of the times which they celebrate or deplore The observation which has been applied to a man may be extended to a whole people that the energy of the sword is communicated to the pen and it will be found by experience that the tone of history will rise or fall with the spirit of the age From these considerations I should have abandoned without regret the Greek slaves and their servile historians had I not reflected that the fate of the Byzan tine monarchy is passively connected with the most splendid and important revo lutions which have changed the state of the world The space of the lost pro vinces was immediately replenished with new colonies and rising kingdoms the active virtues of peace and war deserted from the vanquished to the victorious nations and it is in their origin and conquests in their religion and government that we must explore the causes and effects of the decline and fall of the eastern empire Nor will this scope of narrative the riches and variety of these mate rials be incompatible with the unity of design and composition As in his daily prayers the Mussulman of Fez or Delhi still turns his face towards the temple of Mecca the historian s eye shall be always fixed on the city of Constantinople The excursive line may embrace the wilds of Arabia and Tartary but the circle will be ultimately reduced to the decreasing limit of the Roman monarchy On this principle I shall establish the plan of the two last volumes of the pre sent work The first chapter will contain in a regular series the emperors who reigned at Constantinople during a period of six hundred years from the days of Heraclius to the Latin conquest a rapid abstract which may be supported by a general appeal to the order and text of the original historians In this introduc tion L shall confine myself to the revolutions of the throne the succession of fami lies the personal characters of the Greek princes the mode of their life and death the maxims and influence of their domestic governments and the tendency of their reign to accelerate or suspend the downfal of the eastern empire Such a chronological review will serve to illustrate the various arguments of the subse quent chapters and each circumstance of the eventful story of the barbarians will adapt itself in a proper place to the Byzantine annals The internal state of the empire and the dangerous heresy of the Paulicians which shook the east and en lightened the west will be the subject of two separate chapters but these inqui ries must be postponed till our farther progress shall have opened the view Of the world in the ninth and tenth centuries of the Christian era After this foundation of Byzantine history the following nations will pass before our eyes and each will occupy the space to which it may be entitled by greatness or merit or the degree of connexion with the Roman world and the present age I The Franks a ge neral appellation which includes all the barbarians of France Italy and Ger many who were united by the sword and sceptre of Charlemagne The perse cution of images and their votaries separated Rome and Italy from the Byzantine throne and prepared the restoration of the Roman empire in the west II The Arabs or Saracens Three ample chapters will be devoted to this curious and interesting object In the first after a picture of the country and its inhabitants I shall investigate the character of Mahomet the character religion and success of the prophet In the second I shall lead the Arabs to the conquest of Syria Egypt and Africa the provinces of the Roman empire nor can I check their victorious career till they have overthrown the monarchies of Persia and Spain In the third I shall inquire how Constantinople and Europe were saved by the luxury and arts the division and decay of the empire of the caliphs A single chapter will include III The Bulgarians IV Hungarians and V Rus sians who assaulted bv sea or by land the provinces and the capital but the last of these so important in their present greatness will excite some curiosity in their origin and infancy VI The Normans or rather the private adventures of that warlike people who founded a powerful kingdom in Apulia and Sicily shook the 2Z8 THE DECLINE AND FALL throne of Constantinople displayed the trophies of chivalry and almost realized the wonders of romance VII The Latins the subjects of the pope the nations of the west who enlisted under the banner of the cross for the recovery and relief of the holy sepulchre The Greek emperors were terrified and preserved by the myriads of pilgrims who marched to Jerusalem with Godfrey of Bouillon and the peers of Christendom 1 he second and third crusades trod on the footsteps of the first Asia and Europe were mingled in a sacred war of two hundred years and the Christian powers were bravely resisted and finally expelled by Saladin and the mamalukes of Egjpt In these memorable crusades a fleet and army of French and Venetians were diverted from Syria to the Thracian Bosphorus they assaulted the capital they subverted the Greek monarchy and a dynasty of La tin princes was seated near threescore years on the throne of Constantine VIII The Greeks themselves during this period of captivity and exile must be con sidered as a foreign nation the enemies and again the sovereigns of Constantino ple Misfortune had rekindled a spark of national virtue and the imperial series may be continued with some dignity from their restoration to the Turkish conquest IX The Moguls and Tartars By the arms of Zingis and his descendants the globe was shaken from China to Poland and Greece the sultans were over thrown the caliphs fell and the Caesars trembled on their throne The victories of Timour suspended above fifty years the final ruin of the Byzantine empire X I have already noticed the first appearance of the Turks and the names of the fathers of Seljuk and Othman discriminate the two successive dynasties of the nations which emerged in the eleventh century from the Scythian wilderness The former established a potent and splendid kingdom from the banks of the Oxus to Antioch and Nice and the first crusade was provoked by the violation of Jerusalem and the danger of Constantinople From an humble origin the Otto mans arose the scourge and terror of Christendom Constantinople was besieged and taken by Mahomet II and his triumph annihilates the remnant the image the title of the Roman empire in the east The schism of the Greeks will be con nected with their last calamities and the restoration of learning in the western world I shall return from the captivity of the new to the ruins of Ancient Rome and the venerable name the interesting theme will shed a ray of glory on the conclusion of my labours The emperor Heraclius had punished a tyrant and ascended his throne and the memory of his reign is perpetuated by the transient conquest and irreparable loss of the eastern provinces After the death of Eudocia his first wife he disobeyed the patriarch and violated the laws by his second marriage with his niece Marti na and the superstition of the Greeks beheld the judgment of heaven in the dis eases of the father and the deformity of his offspring But the opinion of an il legitimate birth is sufficient to distract the choice and loosen the obedience of the people the ambition of Martina was quickened by maternal love and perhaps by the envy of a step mother and the aged husband was too feeble to withstand the arts of conjugal allurements Constantine his eldest son enjoyed in a mature age the title of Augustus but the weakness of his constitution required a colleague and a guardian and he yielded with secret reluctance to the partition of the em pire The senate was summoned to the palace to ratitify or attest the association of Heracleonas the son of Martina the imposition of the diadem was consecrated by the prayer and blessing of the patriarch the senators and patricians adored the majesty of the great emperor and the partners of his reign and as soon as the doors were thrown open they were hailed by the tumultuary but important voice of the soldiers After an interval of five months the pompous ceremonies which formed the essence of the Byzantine state were celebrated in the cathedral and the hippodrome the concord of the royal brothers was affectedly displayed by the younger leaning on the arm of the elder and the name of Martina was mingled in the reluctant or venal acclamations of the people Heraclius survived this association about two years his last testimony declared his two sons the equal heirs of the eastern empire and commanded them to honour his widow Martina as their mother and their sovereign When Martina first appeared on the throne with the name and attributes of royalty she was checked by a firm though respectful opposition and the dying embers of freedom were kindled by the breath of superstitious prejudice â We reverence exclaimed the voice of a citizen we reverence the mother of our OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 239  princes but to those princes alone our obedience is due and Constantine the el der emperor is of an age to sustain in his own hands the weight of the sceptre Your sex is excluded by nature from the toils of government How could you combat how could you answer the barbarians who with hostile or friendly in tentions may approach the royal city May heaven avert from the Roman re public this national disgrace which would provoke the patience of the slaves of Persia Martina descended from the throne with indignation and sought a re fuge in the female apartment of the palace The reign of Constantine ifi lasted only one hundred and three days he expired in the thirtieth year of his age and although his life had been a long malady a belief was entertained that poison had been the means and his cruel step mother the author of his untimely fate Mar tina reaped indeed the harvest of his death and assumed the government in the name of the surviving emperor but the incestuous widow of Heraclius was uni versally abhorred the jealousy of the people was awakened and the two orphans whom Constantine had left became the objects of the public care It was in vain that the son of Martina who was no more than fifteen years of age was taught to declare himself the guardian of his nephews one of whom he had presented at the baptismal font it was in vain that he swore on the wood of the true cross to defend them against all their enemies On his death bed the late emperor des patched a trusty servant to arm the troops and provinces of the east in the defence of his helpless children the eloquence and liberality of Valentin had been success ful and from his camp of Chalcedon he boldly demanded the punishment of the assassins and the restoration of the lawful heir The license of the soldiers who devoured the grapes and drank the wine of their Asiatic vineyards provoked the citizens of Constantinople against the domestic authors of their calamities and the dome of St Sophia re echoed not with prayers and hymns but with the cla mours and imprecations of an enraged multitude At their imperious command Heracleonas appeared in the pulpit with the eldest of the royal orphans Constans alone was saluted as emperor of the Romans and a crown of gold which had been taken from the tomb of Heraclius was placed on his head with the solemn bene diction of the patriarch But in the tumult of joy and indignation the church was pillaged the sanctuary was polluted by a promiscuous crowd of Jews and barba rians and the Monothelite Pyrrhus a creature of the empress after dropping a protestation on the altar escaped by a prudent flight from the zeal of the catho lics A more serious and bloody task was reserved for the senate who derived a temporary strength from the consent of the soldiers and people The spirit of Roman freedom revived the ancient and awful examples of the judgment of ty rants and the imperial culprits were deposed and condemned as the authors of the death of Constantine But the severity of the conscript fathers was stained by the indiscriminate punishment of the innocent and the gulity Martina and Heracleo â nas were sentenced to the amputation the former of her tongue the latter of hit nose and after this cruel execution they consumed the remainder of their days in exile and oblivion The Greeks who were capable of reflection might find some consolation for their servitude by observing the abuse of power when it was lodged for a moment in the hands of an aristocracy We shall imagine ourselves transported five hundred years backwards to the age of the Antonines if we listen to the oration which Constans II pronounced in the twelfth year of his age before the Byzantine senate After returning his thanks for the just punishment of the assassins who had intercepted the fairest hopes of his father s reign â By the Divine Providence said the young empe ror  and by your righteous decree Martina and her incestuous progeny have been cast headlong from the throne Your majesty and wisdom have prevented the Roman state from degenerating into lawless tyranny I therefore exhort and beseech you to stand forth as the counsellors and judges of the common safety The senators were gratified bv the respectful address and liberal donative of their sovereign but these servile Greeks were unworthy and regardless of freedom and in his mind the lesson of an hour was quickly erased by the prejudices of the age and the habits of despotism He retained only a jealous fear lest the senate or people should one day invade the right of primogeniture and seat his brother Theodosius on an equal throne By the imposition of holy orders the grandson of Heraclius was disqualified for the purple but this ceremony which seemed to profane the sacraments of the church was insufficient to appease the suspicions of the tyrant and the death of the deacon Theodosius could alone expiate the crime of his royal birth His murder was avenged by the imprecations of the   THE DECLINE AND FALL people and the assassin in the fulness of power was driven from his capital into voluntary and perpetual exile Constans embarked for Greece and as if he meant to retort the abhorrence which he deserved he is said from the imperial galley to have spit against the walls of his native city After passing the winter at Athens he sailed to Tarentum in Italy visited Rome and concluded a long pilgrimage of disgrace and sacrilegious rapine by fixing his residence at Syra cuse But if Constans would fly from his people he could not fly from himself The remorse of his conscience created a phantom who pursued him by land and sea by day and by night and the visionary Theodosius presented to his lips a cup of blood said or seemed to say Drink brother drink a sure emblem of the ag gravation of his guilt since he had received from the hands of the deacon the mys tic cup of the blood of Christ Odious to himself and to mankind Constans pe rished by domestic perhaps by episcopal treason in the capital of Sicily A ser vant who waited in the bath after pouring warm water on his head struck him violently with the vase He fell stunned by the blow and suffocated by the wa ter and his attendants who wondered at the tedious delay beheld with indiffer ence the corpse of their lifeless emperor The troops of Sicily invested with the purple an obscure youth whose inimitable beauty eluded and it might easily elude the declining art of the painters and sculptors of the age Constans had left in the Byzantine palace three sons the eldest of whom had been clothed in his infancy with the purple When the father summoned them to attend his person in Sicily these precious hostages were detained by the Greeks and a firm refusal informed him that they were the children of the state The news of his murder was conveyed with almost supernatural speed from Syracuse to Constantinople and Constantine the eldest of his sons inherited his throne without being the heir of the public hatred His subjects contributed with zeal and alacrity to chastise the guilt and presumption of a province which had usurped the rights of the senate and people the young emperor sailed from the Hellespont with a powerful fleet and the legions of Rome and Carthage were assembled un der his standard in the harbour of Syracuse The defeat of the Sicilian tyrant was easy his punishment just and his beauteous head was exposed in the hippodrome but I cannot applaud the clemency of a prince who among a crowd of victims condemned the son of apatrician for deploring with some bitterness the execution of a virtuous father The youth was castrated he survived the operation and the memory of this indecent cruelty is preserved by the elevation of Germanus to the rank of a patriarch and saint After pouring this bloody libation on his father s tomb Constantine returned to his capital and the growth of his young beard during the Sicilian voyage was announced by the familiar surname of Po gonatus to the Grecian world But his reign like that of his predecessor was stained with fraternal discord On his two brothers Heraclius and Tiberius he had bestowed the title of Augustus an empty title for they continued to languish without trust or power in the solitude of the palace At their secret instigation the troops of the Anatolian theme or province approached the city on the Asiatic side demanded for the royal brothers the partition or exercise of sovereignty and supported their seditious claim by a theological argument They were Chris tians they cried and orthodox catholics the sincere votaries of the holy and un divided Trinity Since there are three equal persons in heaven it is reasonable there should be three equal persons upon earth The emperor invited these learned divines to a friendly conference in which they might propose their arguments to the senate they obeyed the summons but the prospect of their bodies hanging on a gib bet in the suburb of Galata reconciled their companions to the unity of the reign of Constantine He pardoned his brothers and their names were still pronounced in the public acclamations but on the repetition or suspicion of a similar offence the obnoxious princes were deprived of their titles and noses in the presence of the catholic bishops who were assembled at Constantinople in the sixth general synod In the close of his life Pogonatus was anxious only to establish the right of primogeniture the hair of his two sons Justinian and Heraclius was offered on the shrine of St Peter as a symbol of their spiritual adoption by the pope but the elder was alone exalted to the rank of Augustus and the assurance of the em pire After the decease of his father the inheritance of the Roman world devolved to Justinian II and the name of a triumphant lawgiver was dishonoured by the vices of a boy who imitated his namesake onlv in the expensive luxury of build ing His passions were strong his understanding was feeble and he was intoxi OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 241 cated with a foolish pride that his birth had given him the command of millions of whom the smallest community would not have chosen him for their local ma gistrate His favourite ministers were two beings the least susceptible of human sympathy a eunuch and a monk to the one he abandoned the palace to the other the finances the former corrected the emperor s mother with a scourge the lat ter suspended the insolvent tributaries with their heads downward over a slow and smoky fire Since the days of Commodus and Caracalla the cruelty of the Roman princes had most commonly been the effect of their fear but Justinian who possessed some vigour of character enjoyed the sufferings and braved the revenge of his subjects about ten years till the measure was full of his crimes and of their patience In a dark dungeon Leontius a general of reputation had groaned above three years with some of the noblest and most deserving of the pa tricians he was suddenly drawn forth to assume the government of Greece and this promotion of an injured man was a mark of the contempt rather than of the confidence of his prince As he was followed to the port by the kind offices of his friends Leontius observed with a sigh that he was a victim adorned for sa crifice and that inevitable death would pursue his footsteps They ventured to reply that glory and empire might be the recompense of a generous resolution that every order of men abhorred the reign of a monster and that the hands of two hundred thousand patriots expected only the voice of a leader The night was chosen for their deliverance and in the first effort of the conspirators the prefect was slain and the prisons were forced open the emissaries of Leontius proclaimed in every street â Christians to St Sofihia and the seasonable text of the patri arch This is the day of the Lord was the prelude of an inflammatory sermon From the church the people adjourned to the hippodrome Justinian in whose cause not a sword had been drawn was dragged before these tumultuary judges and their clamours demanded the instant death of the tyrant But Leontius who was already clothed with the purple cast an eye of pity on the prostrate son of his own benefactor and of so many emperors The life of Justinian was spared the amputation of his nose perhaps of his tongue was imperfectly performed the happy flexibility of the Greek language could impose the name of Rhinotmetus and the mutilated tyrant was banished to Chersonse in Crim Tartary a lonely settlement where corn wine and oil were imported as foreign luxuries On the edge of the Scythian wilderness Justinian still cherished the pride of his birth and the hope of his restoration After three years exile he received the pleasing intelligence that his injury was avenged by a second revolution and that Leontius in his turn had been dethroned and mutilated by the rebel Apsimar who assumed the more respectable name of Tiberius But the claim of lineal suc cession was still formidable to a plebeian usurper and his jealousy was stimulated by the complaints and charges of the Chersonites who beheld the vices of the ty rant in the spirit of the exile With a band of followers attached to his person by common hope or common despair Justinian fled from the inhospitable shore to the horde of the Chozars who pitched their tents between the Tanais and Bo rysthenes The khan entertained with pity and respect the royal suppliant Phana goria once an opulent city on the Asiatic side of the lake Moeotis was assigned for his residence and every Roman prejudice was stifled in his marriage with the sister of the barbarian who seems however from the name of Theodora to have received the sacrament of baptism But the faithless Chozar was soon tempted by the gold of Constantinople and had not the design been revealed by the conjugal love of Theodora her husband must have been assassinated or be trayed into the power of his enemies After strangling with his own hands the two emissaries of the khan Justinian sent back his wife to her brother and em barked on the Euxine in search of new and more faithful allies His vessel was assaulted by a violent tempest and one of his pious companions advised him to deserve the mercy of God by a vow of general forgiveness if he should be re stored to the throne  Of forgiveness replied the intrepid tyrant  may I pe rish this instantâ may the Almighty whelm me in the wavesâ if I consent to spare a single head of my enemies He survived this impious menace sailed into the mouth of the Danube trusted his person in the royal village of the Bulgarians and purchased the aid of Terbelis a pagan conqueror by the promise of his daughter and a fair partition of the treasures of the empire The Bulgarian kingdom extended to the confines of Thrace and the two princes besieged Con stantinople at the head of fifteen thousand horse Apsimar was dismayed by the sudden and hostile apparition of his rival whose head had been promised by the Vox nr n 242 THE DECLINE AND FALL Chozar and of whose evasion he was yet ignorant After an absence of ten years the crimes of Justinian were faintly remembered and the birth and misfortunes of their hereditary sovereign excited the pity of the multitude ever discontented with the ruling powers and by the active diligence of his adherents he was intro duced into the city and palace of Constantine In rewarding his allies and recalling his wife Justinian displayed some sense of honour and gratitude and Terbelis retired after sweeping away a heap of gold coin which ne measured with his Scythian whip But never was vow more reli giously performed than the sacred oath of revenge which he had sworn amidst the storms of the Euxine The two usurpers for I must reserve the name of tyrant for the conqueror were dragged into the hippodrome the one from his prison the other from his palace Before their execution Leontius and Apsimar were cast prostrate in chains beneath the throne of the emperor and Justinian planting a foot on each of their necks contemplated above an hour the chariot race while  the inconstant people shouted in the words of the psalmist â Thou shalt tram ple on the asp and basilisk and on the lion and dragon shalt thou set thy foot The universal defection which he had once experienced might provoke him to re peat the wish of Caligula that the Roman people had but one head Yet I shall presume to observe that such a wish is unworthy of an ingenious tyrant since his revenge and cruelty would have been extinguished by a single blow instead of the slow variety of tortures which Justinian inflicted on the victims of his anger His pleasures were inexhaustible neither private virtue nor pujlic service could ex piate the guilt of active or even passive obedience to an established government and during the six years of his new reign he considered the axe the cord and the rack as the only instruments of royalty But his most implacable hatred was pointed against the Chersonites who had insulted his exile and violated the laws of hospitality Their remote situation afforded some means of defence or at least of escape and a grievous tax was imposed on Constantinople to supply the preparations of a fleet and army All are guilty and all must perish was the mandate of Justinian arid the bloody execution was intrusted to his favourite Ste Ehen who was recommended by the epithet of the savage Yet even the savage tephen imperfectly accomplished the intentions of his sovereign The slowness of his attack allowed the greater part of the inhabitants to withdraw into the country and the minister of vengeance contented himself with reducing the youth of both sexes to a state of servitude with roasting alive seven of the principal citizens with drowning twenty in the sea and with reserving forty two in chains to receive their doom from the mouth of the emperor In their return the fleet was driven on the rocky shores of Anatolia and Justinian applauded the obedience of the Euxine which had involved so many of his subjects and enemies in a com mon shipwreck but the tyrant was still insatiate of blcod and a second expedition was commanded to extirpate the remains of the proscribed colony In the short interval the Chersonites had returned to their city and were prepared to die in arms the khan of the Chozars had renounced the cause of his odious brother the exiles of every province were assembled in Tauris and Bardanes under the name of Philippicus was invested with the purple The imperial troops unwill ing and unable to perpetuate the revenge of Justinian escaped his displeasure by abjuring his allegiance the fleet under their new sovereign steered back a more auspicious course to the harbours of Synope and Constantinople and every tongue was prompt to pronounce every hand to execute the death of the tyrant Destitute of friends he was deserted by his barbarian guards and the stroke of the assassin was praised as an act of patriotism and Roman virtue His son Tiberius had taken refuge in a church his aged grandmother guarded the door and the innocent youth suspending round his neck the most formidable relics embraced with one hand the altar with the other the wood of the true cross But the popular fury that dares to trample on superstition is deaf to the cries of humanity and the race of Heraclius was extinguished after a reign of one hundred years Between the fall of Heraclian and the rise of the Isaurian dynasty a short in terval of six years is divided into three reigns Bardanes or Philippicus was hailed at Constantinople as a hero who had delivered his country from a tyrant and he might taste some moments of happiness in the first transports of sincere and universal joy Justinian had left behind him an ample treasure the fruit of cruelty and rapine but this useful fund was soon and idly dissipated by his succes sor On the festival of his birth day Philippicus entertained the multitude with OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 243 the games of the hippodrome from thence he paraded through the streets with a thousand banners and a thousand trumpets refreshed himself in the baths of Zeuxippus and returning to the palace entertained his nobles with a sumptuous banquet At the meridian hour he withdrew to his chamber intoxicated with flattery and wine and forgetful that his example had made every subject ambi tious and that every ambitious subject was his secret enemy Some bold conspi rators introduced themselves into the disorder of the feast and the slumbering monarch was surprised bound blinded and deposed before he was sensible of his danger Yet the traitors were deprived of their reward and the free voice of the senate and people promoted Artemius from the office of secretary to that of emperor he assumed the title of Anastasius II and displayed in a short and trou bled reign the virtues both of peace and war But after the extinction of the im perial line the rule of obedience was violated and every change diffused the seeds of new revolutions In a mutiny of the fleet an obscure and reluctant officer of the revenue was forcibly invested with the purple after some months of a naval war Anastasius resigned the sceptre and the conqueror Theodosius III submitted in his turn to the superior ascendant of Leo the general and emperor of the oriental troops His two predecessors were permitted to embrace the ecclesiastical pro fession the restless impatience of Anastasius tempted him to risk and to lose his life in a treasonable enterprise but the last days of Theodosius were honourable and secure The single and sublime word  health which he inscribed on his tomb expresses the confidence of philosophy or religion and the fame of his mi racles was long preserved among the people of Ephesus This convenient shel ter of the church might sometimes impose a lesson of clemency but it may be questioned whether it is for the public interest to diminish the perils of unsuccess ful ambition I have dwelt on the fall of a tyrant I shall briefly represent the founder of a new dynasty who is known to posterity by the invectives of his enemies and whose public and private life is involved in the ecclesiastical story of the Iconoclasts Yet in spite of the clamours of superstition a favourable prejudice for the character of Leo the Isaurian may be reasonably drawn from the obscurity of his birth and the duration of his reign â I In an age of manly spirit the prospect of an impe perial reward would have kindled every energy of the mind and produced a crowd of competitors as deserving as they were desirous to reign Even in the corruption and debility of the modern Greeks the elevation of a plebeian from the last to the first rank of society supposes some qualifications above the level of the multitude He would probably be ignorant and disdainful of speculative sci ence and in the pursuit of fortune he might absolve himself from the obligations of benevolence and justice but to his character we may ascribe the useful virtues of prudence and fortitude the knowledge of mankind and the important art of gaining their confidence and directing their passions It is agreed that Leo was a native of Isauria and that Conon was his primitive name The writers whose awkward satire is praise describe him as an itinerant pedlar who drove an ass with some paltry merchandise to the country fairs and foolishly relate that he met on the road some Jewish fortune tellers who promised him the Roman empire on condition that he should abolish the worship of idols A more probable account relates the migration of his father from Asia Minor to Thrace where he exer cised the lucrative trade of a grazier and he must have acquired considerable wealth since the first introduction of his son was procured by a supply of five hun dred sheep to the imperial camp His first service was in the guards of Justinian where he soon attracted the notice and by degrees the jealousy of the tyrant His valour and dexterity were conspicuous in the Colchian war from Anastasius he received the command of the Anatolian legions and by the suffrage of the sol diers he was raised to the empire With the general applause of the Roman world II In this dangerous elevation Leo III supported himself against the envy of his equals the discontent of a powerful faction and the assaults of his foreign and do mestic enemies The catholics who accuse his religious innovations are obliged to confess that they were undertaken with temper and conducted with firmness Their silence respects the wisdom of his administration and the purity of his man ners After a reign of twenty four years he peaceably expired in his palace of Constantinople and the purple which he had acquired was transmitted by the right of inheritance to the third generation In the long reign of thirty four years the son and successor of Leo Constantine V surnamedCopronymus attacked with less temperate zeal the images or idols MA THE DECLINE AND FALL of the church Their votaries have exhausted the bitterness of religious gall ih their portrait of this spotted panther this antichrist this flying dragon of the ser pent s seed who surpassed the vices of Elagabalus and Nero His reign was a long butchery of whatever was most noble or holy or innocent in his empire In person the emperor assisted at the execution of his victims surveyed their ago nies listened to their groans and indulged without satiating his appetite for blood a plate of noses was accepted as a grateful offering and his domestics were often pollution of his baptismal font The infant might be excused but the manly pleasures of Copronymus degraded him below the level of a brute his lust con founded the eternal distinctions of sex and species and he seemed to extract some unnatural delight from the objects most offensive to human sense In his religion the Iconoclast was a heretic a Jew a Mahometan a pagan and an atheist and his belief of an invisible power could be discovered only in his magic rites human vic tims and nocturnal sacrifices to Venus and the demons of antiquity His life was stained with the most opposite vices and the ulcers which covered his body anti cipated before his death the sentiment of hell tortures Of these accusations which I have so patiently copied a part is refuted by its own absurdity and in the private anecdotes of the life of princes the lie is more easy as the detection is more difficult Without adopting the pernicious maxim that were much is al leged something must be true I can however discern that Constantine V was dissolute and cruel Calumny is more prone to exaggerate than to invent and her licentious tongue is checked in some measure by the experience of the age and country to which she appeals Of the bishops and monks the generals and ma gistrates who are said to have suffered under his reign the numbers are recorded the names were conspicuous the execution was public the mutilation visible and permanent The catholics hated the person and government of Copronymus but even their hatred is a proof of their oppression They dissemble the provo cations which might excuse or justify his rigour but even these provocations must gradually inflame his resentment and harden his temper in the use or the abuse of despotism Yet the character of the fifth Constantine was not devoid of merit nor did his government always deserve the curses or the contempt of the Greeks From the confession of his enemies I am informed of the restoration of an ancient aqueduct of the redemption of two thousand five hundred captives of the uncom mon plenty of the times and of the new colonies with which he repeopled Constan tinople and the Thracian cities They reluctantly praise his activity and courage he was on horseback in the field at the head of his legions and although the fortune of his arms was various he triumphed by sea and land on the Euphrates and the Danube in civil and barbarian war Heretical praise must be cast into the scale to counterbalance the weight of orthodox invective The Iconoclasts revered the virtues of the prince forty years after his death they still prayed before the tomb of the saint A miraculous vision was propagated by fanaticism or fraud and the Christian hero appeared on a milk white steed brandishing his lance against the pagans of Bulgaria  an absurd fable says the catholic histo rian  since Copronymus is chained with the demons in the abyss of hell Leo IV the son of the fifth and the father of the sixth Constantine was of a feeble constitution both of mind and body and the principal care of his reign was the settlement of the succession The association of the young Constantine was urged by the officious zeal of his subjects and the emperor conscious of his de cay complied after a prudent hesitation with their unanimous wishes The royal infant at the age of five years was crowned with his mother Irene and the national consent was ratified by every circumstance of pomp and solemnity that could dazzle the eyes or bind the conscience of the Greeks An oath of fidelity was administered in the palace the church and the hippodrome to the several orders of the state who abjured the holy names of the son and mother of God  Be witness u Christ that we will watch over the safety of Constantine the son of Leo expose our lives in his service and bear true allegiance to his person and posterity They pledged their faith on the wood of the true cross and the act of their engagement was deposited on the altar of St Sophia The first to swear and the first to violate their oath were the five sons of Copronymus by a second marriage and the story of these princes is singular and tragic The tight of pri mogeniture excluded them from the throne the injustice of their elder brother defrauded them of a legacy of about two millions sterling some vain titles were not deemed a sufficient compensation for wealth and power and they repeatedly  surname was derived from his OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 245 conspired against their nephew before and after the death of his father Their first attempt was pardoned for the second offence they were condemned to the ecclesiastical state and for the third treason Nicephorus the eldest and most guilty was deprived of his eyes and his four brothers Christopher Nicetas Anthemeus and Eudoxas were punished as a milder sentence by the amputation of their tongues After five years confinement they escaped to the church of St Sophia and displayed a pathetic spectacle to the people Countrymen and Christians cried Nicephorus for himself and his mute brethren behold the sons of your emperor if you can still recognize our features in this miserable state A life an imperfect life is all that the malice of our enemies has spared It is now threatened and we now throw ourselves on your compassion The rising murmur might have produced a revolution had it not been checked by the pre sence of a minister who soothed the unhappy princes with flattery and hope and gently drew them from the sanctuary to the palace They were speedily em barked for Greece and Athens was allotted for the place of their exile In this calm retreat and in their helpless condition Nicephorus and his brothers were tormented by the thirst of power and tempted by a Sclavonian chief who offered to break their prison and to lead them in arms and in the purple to the gates of Constantinople But the Athenian people ever zealous in the cause of Irene prevented her justice or cruelty and the five sons of Copronymus were plunged in eternal darkness and oblivion For himself that emperor had chosen a barbarian wife the daughter of the khan of the Chozars but in the marriage of his heir he preferred an Athenian virgin an orphan seventeen years old whose sole fortune must have consisted in her personal accomplishments The nuptials of Leo and Irene were celebrated with royal pomp she soon acquired the love and confidence of a feeble husband and in his testament he declared the empress guardian of the Roman world and of their son Constantine VI who was no more than ten years of age During his childhood Irene most ably and assiduously discharged in her public administration the duties of a faithful mother and her zeal in the restoration of images has de served the name and honours of a saint which she still occupies in the Greek ca lendar But the emperor attained the maturity of youth the maternal yoke be came more grievous and he listened to the favourites of his own age who shared his pleasures and were ambitious of sharing his power Their reasons convinced him of his right their praises of his ability to reign and he consented to reward the services of Irene by a perpetual banishment to the isle of Sicily But her vigilance and penetration easily disconcerted their rash projects a similar or more severe punishment was retaliated on themselves and their advisers and Irene inflicted on the ungrateful prince the chastisement of a boy After this contest the mother and the son were at the head of two domestic factions and instead of mild influence and voluntary obedience she held in chains a captive and an enemy The empress was overthrown by the abuse of victory the oath of fidelity which she exacted to herself alone was pronounced with reluctant mur murs and the bold refusal of the Armenian guards encouraged a free and general declaration that Constantine VI was the lawful emperor of the Romans In this character he ascended his hereditary throne and dismissed Irene to a life of soli tude and repose But her haughty spirit condescended to the arts of dissimulation  she flattered the bishops and eunuchs revived the filial tenderness of the prince regained his confidence and betrayed his credulity The character of Constan tine was not less destitute of sense or spirit but his education had been studiously neglected and his ambitious mother exposed to the public censure the vices which she had nourished and the actions which she had secretly advised his divorce and second marriage offended the prejudices of the clergy and by his imprudent rigour he forfeited the attachment of the Armenian guards A powerful conspi racy was formed for the restoration of Irene and the secret though widely dif fused was faithfully kept above eight months till the emperor suspicious of his clanger escaped from Constantinople with the design of appealing to the pro vinces and armies By this hasty flight the empress was left on the brink of the precipice yet before she implored the mercy of her son Irene addressed a private epistle to the friends whom she had placed about his person with a menace that unless they accomplished she would reveal their treason Their fear rendered them intrepid they seized the emperor on the Asiatic shore and he was transport ed to the Pophyry apartment of the palace where he had first seen the light In the mind of Irene ambition had stifled every sentiment of humanity and nature 24f THE DECLINE AND FALL and it was decreed in her bloody council that Constantine should be rendered in capable of the throne her emissaries assaulted the sleeping prince and stabbed their daggers with such violence and precipitation into his eyes as if they meant to execute a mortal sentence An ambiguous passage of Theophanes persuaded the annalist of the church that death was the immediate consequence of this bar barous execution The catholics have been deceived or subdued by the authority of Baronius and protestant zeal has re echoed the words of a cardinal desirous as it should seem to favour the patroness of images Yet the blind son of Irene survived many years oppressed by the court and forgotten by the world the Isaurian dynasty was silently extinguished and the memory of Constantine was recalled only by the nuptials of his daughter Euphrosyne with the emperor Mi chael II The most bigoted orthodoxy has justly execrated the unnatural mother who may not easily be paralleled in the history of crimes To her bloody deed superstition has attributed a subsequent darkness of seventeen days during which many vessels in mid day were driven from their course as if the sun a globe of fire so vast and so remote could sympathise with the atoms of a revolving planet On earth the crime of Irene was left five years unpunished her reign was crowned with exter nal splendour and if she could silence the voice of conscience she neither heard nor regarded the reproaches of mankind The Roman world bowed to the govern ment of a female and as she moved through the streets of Constantinople the reins of her four milk white steeds were held by as many patricians who marched on foot before the golden chariot of their queen But these patricians were for the most part eunuchs and their black ingratitude justified on this occasion the popular hatred and contempt Raised enriched intrusted with the first dignities of the empire they basely conspired against their benefactress the great treasu rer Nicephorus was secretly invested with the purple her successor was intro duced into the palace and crowned at St Sophia by the venal patriarchs In their first interview she recapitulated with dignity the revolutions of her life gently ac cused the perfidy of Nicephorus insinuated that he owed his life to her unsuspi cious clemency and for the throne and treasures which she resigned solicited a de cent and honourable retreat His avarice refused this modest compensation and in her exile to the isle of Lesbos the empress earned a scanty subsistence by the labours of her distaff Many tyrants have reigned undoubtedly more criminal than Nicephorus but none perhaps have more deeply incurred the universal abhorrence of their people His character was stained with the three odious vices of hypocrisy ingratitude and avarice his want of virtue was not redeemed by any superior talents nor his want of talents by any pleasing qualifications Unskilful and unfortunate in war Nicephorus was vanquished by the Saracens and slain by the Bulgarians and the advantage of his death overbalanced in the public opinion the destruction of a Roman army His son and heir Stauracius escaped from the field with a mortal wound yet six months of an expiring life were sufficient to refute his indecent though popular declaration that he would in all things avoid the example of his father On the near prospect of his decease Michael the great master of the palace and the husband of his sister Procopia was named by every person of the palace and city except by his envious brother Tenacious of a sceptrer now fall ing from his hand he conspired against the life of his successor and cherished the idea of changing to a democracy the Roman empire But these rash projects served only to inflame the zeal of the people and to remove the scruples of the candidate Michael L accepted the purple and before he sunk into the grave the son of Ni cephorus implored the clemency of his new sovereign Had Michael in an age of peace ascended an hereditary throne he might have reigned and died the father of his people but his mild virtues were adapted to the shade of private life nor was he capable of controlling the ambition of his equals or of resisting the arms of the victorious Bulgarians While his want of ability and success exposed him to the contempt of the soldiers the masculine spirit of his wife Procopia awakened their indignation Even the Greeks of the ninth century were provoked by the insolence of a female who in the front of the standards presumed to direct their discipline and animate their valour and their licentious clamours advised the new Semiramis to reverence the majesty of a Roman camp After an unsuccessful taimpaign the emperor left in their winter quarters of Thrace a disaffected army under the command of his enemies and their artful eloquence persuaded the sol fliers to break the dominion of the eunuchs to degrade the husband of Procopia THE ROMAN EMPIRE 24 and to assert the right of a military election They marched towards the capital yet the clergy the senate and the people of Constantinople adhered to the cause of Michael and the troops and treasures of Asia might have protracted the mis chiefs of civil war But his humanity by the ambitious it will be termed his weakness protested that not a drop of Christian blood should be shed in his quar rel and his messengers presented the conquerors with the keys of the city and the palace They were disarmed by his innocence and submission his life and his eyes were spared and the imperial monk enjoyed the comforts of solitude and reli gion above thirty two years after he had been stripped of the purple and separated from his wife A rebel in the time of Nicephorus the famous and unfortunate Bardanes had once the curiosity to consult an Asiatic prophet who after prognosticating his fall announced the fortunes of his three principal officers Leo the Armenian Michael the Phrygian and Thomas the Cappadocian the successive reigns of the two for mer the fruitless and fatal enterprise of the third This prediction was verified or rather was produced by the event Ten years afterwards when the Thracian camp rejected the husband of Procopia the crown was presented to the same Leo the first in military rank and the secret author of the mutiny As he affected to hesitate â With this sword said his companion Michael I will open the gates of Constantinople to your imperial sway or instantly plunge it into your bosom if you obstinately resist the just desires of your fellow soldiers The compli ance of the Armenian was rewarded with the empire and he reigned seven years and a half under the name of Leo V Educated in a camp and ignorant both of laws and letters he introduced into his civil government the rigour and even cru elty of military discipline but if his severity was sometimes dangerous to the in nocent it was always formidable to the guilty â His religious inconstancy was taxed by the epithet of Chameleon but the catholics have acknowledged by the voice of a saint and confessors that the life of the Iconoclast was useful to the republic The zeal of his companion Michael was repaid with riches honours and military command and his subordinate talents were beneficially employed in the public service Yet the Phrygian was dissatisfied at receiving as a favour a scanty por tion of the imperial prize which he had bestowed on his equal and his discontent which sometimes evaporated in a hasty discourse at length assumed a more threat ening and hostile aspect against a prince whom he represented as a cruel tyrant That tyrant however repeatedly detected warned and dismissed the old com panion of his arms till fear and resentment prevailed over gratitude and Michael after a scsutiny into his actions was convicted of treason and sentenced to be burnt alive in the furnace of the private baths The devout humanity of the em press Theophano was fatal to her husband and family A solemn day the twenty fifth of December had been fixed for the execution she urged that the anniver sary of the Saviour s birth would be profaned by this inhuman spectacle and Leo consented with reluctance to a decent respite But on the vigil of the feast his sleepless anxiety prompted him to visit at the dead of night the chamber in which his enemy was confined he beheld him released from his chain and stretched on the jailor s bed in a profound slumber Leo was alarmed at these signs of securi ty and intelligence but though he retired with silent steps his entrance and de parture were noticed by a slave who lay concealed in a corner of the prison Un der the pretence of requesting the spiritual aid of a confessor Michael informed the conspirators that their lives depended on his discretion and that a few hours were left to assure their own safety by the deliverance of their friend and coun try On the great festivals a chosen band of priests and chanters was admitted into the palace by a private gate to sing matins in the chapel and Leo who re gulated with the same strictness the discipline of the choir and of the camp was seldom absent from those early devotions In the ecclesiastical habit but with swords under their robes the conspirators mingled with the procession lurked in the angles of the chapel and expected as the signal of murder the intonation of the first psalm by the emperor himself The imperfect light and the unifor mity of dress might have favoured his escape while their assault was pointed against a harmless priest but they soon discovered their mistake and encom passed on all sides the royal victim Without a weapon and without a friend he grasped a weighty cross and stood at bay against the hunters of his life but as he asked for mercy â This is the hour not of mercy but of vengeance was the inexorable reply The stroke of a well aimed sword separated from hisbodv the right arm and the cross and Leo the Armenian was slain at tne foot of the altar 24S THE DECLINE AND FALL A memorable reverse of fortune was displayed in Michael II who from a defect in his speech was surnamed the Stammerer He was snatched from the fiery furnace to the sovereignty of an empire and as in the tumult a smith could not readily be found the fetters remained on his legs several hours after he was seated on the throne of the Caesars The royal blood which had been the price of his elevation was unprofitably spent in the purple he retained the ignoble vices of his origin and Michael lost his provinces with as supine indifference as if they had been the inheritance of his fathers His title was disputed by Thomas the last of the military triumvirate who transported into Europe fourscore thou sand barbarians from the banks of the Tigris and the shores of the Caspian He formed the siege of Constantinople but the capital was defended with spiritual and carnal weapons a Bulgarian king assaulted the camp of the orientals and Thomas had the misfortune or the weakness to fall alive into the power of the conqueror The hands and feet of the rebel were amputated he was placed on an ass and amidst the insults of the people was led through the streets which he sprinkled with his blood The depravation of manners as savage as they were corrupt is marked by the presence of the emperor himself Deaf to the lamentations of a fellow soldier he incessantly pressed the discovery of more ac complices till his curiosity was checked by the question of an honest or guilty minister â Â Would you give credit to an enemy against the most faithful of your friends  After the death of his first wife the emperor at the request of the se nate drew from her monastery Euphrosyne the daughter of Constantine VI Her august birth might justify a stipulation in the marriage contract that her children should equally share the empire with their elder brother But the nup tials of Michael and Euphrosyne were barren and she was content with the title of mother of Theophilus his son and successor The character of Theophilus is a rare example in which religious zeal has al lowed and perhaps magnified the virtues of a heretic and a persecutor His valour was often felt by the enemies and his justice by the subjects of the monarchy but the valour of Theophilus was rash and fruitless and his justice arbitrary and cruel He displayed the banner of the cross against the Saracens but his five expedi tions were concluded by a signal overthrow Amorium the native city of his an cestors was levelled with the ground and from his military toils he derived only the surname of the Unfortunate The wisdom of a sovereign is comprised in the institution of laws and the choice of magistrates and while he seems without action his civil government revolved round his centre with the silence and order of the planetary system But the justice of Theophilus was fashioned on the mo del of the oriental despots who in personal and irregular acts of authority con sult the reason or passion of the moment without measuring the sentence by the laws or the penalty by offence A poor woman threw herself at the empe ror s feet to complain of a powerful neighbour the brother of the empress who had raised his palace wall to such an inconvenient height that her humble dwelling was excluded from light and air On the proof of the fact instead of granting like an ordinary judge sufficient or ample damages to the plaintiff the sovereign adjudged to her use and benefit the palace and the ground Nor was Theophilus content with this extravagant satisfaction his zeal converted a civil trespass into a criminal act and the unfortunate patrician was stripped and scourged in the public place of Constantinople For some venial offences some defect of equity or vigilance the principal ministers a prefect a questor a cap tain of the guards were banished or mutilated or scalded with boiling pitch or burnt alive in the hippodrome and as these dreadful examples might be the ef fects of error or caprice they must have alienated from his service the best and wisest of the citizens But the pride of the monarch was flattered in the exercise of power or as he thought of virtue and the people safe in their obscurity ap plauded the danger and debasement of their superiors This extraordinary ri gour was justified in some measure by its salutary consequences since after a scrutiny of seventeen days not a complaint or abuse could be found in the court or city and it might be alleged that the Greeks could be ruled only with a rod of iron and that the public interest is the motive and law of the supreme judge Yet in the crime or the suspicion of treason that judge is of all others the most credulous and partial Theophilus rrfight inflict a tardy vengeance on the assas sins of Leo and the saviours of his father but he enjoyed the fruits of their crime and his jealous tyranny sacrificed a brother and a prince to the future safety of his life A Persian or the race of the SaSsanides died in poverty and exile at Cor OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE iM9 stantinople leaving an only son the issue of a plebeian marriage At the age of twelve years the royal birth of Theophobus was revealed and his merit was not unworthy of his birth He was educated in the Byzantine palace a Christian and a soldier advanced with rapid steps in the career of fortune and glory received the hand of the emperor s sister and was promoted to the command of thirty thou sand Persians who like his father had fled from the Mahometan conquerors These troops doubly infected with mercenary and fanatic vices were desirous of revolting against their benefactor and erecting the standard of their native king but the royal Theophobus rejected their offers disconcerted their schemes and escaped from their hands to the camp or palace of his royal brother A generous confidence might have secured a faithful and able guardian for his wife and his in fant son to whom Theophilus in the flower of his age was compelled to leave the inheritance of the empire But his jealousy was exasperated by envy and dis ease he feared the dangerous virtues which might either support or oppress their infancy and weakness and theTJying emperor demanded the head of the Persian prince With savage delight he recognised the familiar features of his brother  Thou art no longer Theophobus he said and sinking on his couch he added with a faltering voice  Soon too soon I shall be no more Theophilus The Russians who have borrowed from the Greeks the greatest part of their civil and ecclesiastical policy preserved till the last century a singular institution in the marriage of the czar They collected not the virgins of every rank and of every province a vain and romantic idea but the daughters of the principal no bles who awaited in the palace the choice of their sovereign It is affirmed that a similar method was adopted in the nuptials of Theophilus With a golden ap ple in his hand he slowly walked between two lines of contending beauties his eye was detained by the charms of Icasia and in the awkwardness of a first de claration the prince could only observe that in this world women had been the cause of much evil And surely sir she pertly replied  they have likewise been the occasion of much good This affectation of unseasonable wit displeased the imperial lover he turned aside in disgust Icasia concealed her mortification in a convent and the modest silence of Theodora was rewarded with the golden le She deserved the love but did not escape the severity of her lord From palace garden he beheld a vessel deeply laden and steering into the port on the discovery that the precious cargo of Syrian luxury was the property of his wife he condemned the ship to the flames with a sharp reproach that her avarice had degraded the character of an empress into that of a merchant Yet his last chdice intrusted her with the guardianship of the empire and her son Michael who was left an orphan in the fifth year of his age The restoration of images and the final extirpation of the Iconoclasts has endeared her name to the devotion of the Greeks but in the fervour of religious zeal Theodora entertained a grateful re gard for the memory and salvation of her husband After thirteen years of a pru dent and frugal administration she perceived the decline of her influence but the second Irene imitated only the virtues of her predecessor Instead of conspiring against the life or government of her son she retired without a struggle though not without a murmur to the solitude of private life deploring the ingratitude the vices and the inevitable ruin of the worthless youth Among the successors of Nero and Elagabalus we have not hitherto found the imitation of their vices the character of a Roman prince who considered pleasure as the object of life and virtue as the enemy of pleasure Whatever might have been the maternal care of Theodora in the education of Michael III her unfor tunate son was a king before he was a man If the ambitious mother laboured to check the progress of reason she could not cool the ebullition of passion and her selfish policy was justly repaid by the contempt and ingratitude of the head strong youth At the age of eighteen he rejected her authority without feeling his own incapacity to govern the empire and himself With 1 heodora all gra vity and wisdom retired from the court and their place was supplied by the al ternate dominion of vice and folly and it was impossible without forfeiting the public esteem to acquire or preserve the favour of the emperor The millions of gold and silver which had been accumulated for the service of the state were lavished on the vilest of men who flattered his passions and shared his pleasures and in a reign of thirteen years the richest of sovereigns was compelled to strip the palace ahd the Churches of their precious furniture Like Nero he delighted in the amusements of the theatre and sighed to be surpassed in the accomplish ments in which he should have blushed to excel Yet the studies of Nero in mu Vol III 32 250 THE DECLINE AND FALL sic and poetry betrayed some symptoms of a liberal taste the more ignoble arte of the son of Theophilus were confined to the chariot race of the hippodrome The four factions which had agitated the peace still amused the idleness of the capi tal for himself the emperor assumed the blue livery the three rival colours were distributed to his favourites and in the vile though eager contention he forgot the dignity of his person and the safety of his dominions He silenced the messenger of an invasion who presumed to divert his attention in the most critical moment of the race and by his command the importunate beacons were ektinguished that too frequently spread the alarm from Tarsus to Constantinople The most skilful charioteers obtained the first place in his confidence and esteem their me rit was profusely rewarded the emperor feasted in their houses and presented their children at the baptismal font and while he applauded his own popularity he affected to blame the cold and stately reserve of his predecessors The unna tural lusts which had degraded even the manhood of Nero were banished from the world yet the strength of Michael was consumed by the indulgence of love and intemperance In his midnight revels when his passions were inflamed by wine he was provoked to issue the most sanguinary commands and if any feelings of humanity were left he was reduced with the return of sense to approve the salutary disobedience of his servants But the most extraordinary feature in the character of Michael is the profane mockery of the religion of his country The superstition of the Greeks might indeed excite the smile of a philosopher but his smile would have been rational and temperate and he must have condemned the ignorant folly of a youth who insulted the objects of public veneration A buffoon of the court was invested in the robes of the patriarch the twelve metropolitans among whom the emperor was ranked assumed their ecclesiastical garments they used or abused the sacred vessels of the altar and in their bacchanalian feasts the holy communion was administered in a nauseous compound of vinegar and mus tard Nor were these impious spectacles concealed from the eyes of the city On the day of a solemn festival the emperor with his bishops or buffoons rode on asses through the streets encountered the true patriarch at the head of his clergy and by their licentious shouts and obscene gestures disordered the gravity of the Christian procession The devotion of Michael appeared only in some of fence to reason or piety be received his theatrical crowns from the statue of the Virgin and an imperial tomb was violated for the sake of burning the bones of Constantine the Iconoclast By this extravagant conduct the son of Theophilus became as contemptible as he was odious every citizen was impatient for the deli verance of his country and even the favourites of the moment were apprehen sive that a caprice might snatch away what a caprice had bestowed In the thir tieth year of his age and in the hour of intoxication and sleep Michael III was murdered in his chamber by the founder of a new dynasty whom the emperor had raised to an equality of rank and power The genealogy of Basil the Macedonian if it be not the spurious offspring of pride and flattery exhibits a genuine picture of the revolution of the most illus trious families The Arsacides the rivals of Rome possessed the sceptre of the east near four hundred years a younger branch of these Parthian kings continued to reign in Armenia and their royal descendants survived the partition and servi tude of that ancient monarchy Two of these Artabanus and Chlienes escaped or retired to the court of Leo I his bounty seated them in a safe and hospitable exile in the province of Macedonia Adrianople was their final settlement During several generations they maintained the dignity of their birth and their Roman patriotism rejected the tempting offers of the Persian and Arabian powers who recalled them to their native country But their splendour was insensibly clouded by time and poverty and the father of Basil was reduced to a small farm which he cultivated with his own hands yet he scorned to disgrace the blood of the Arsacides by a plebeian allianceâ his wife a widow of Adrianople was pleased to count ameng her ancestors the great Constantine and their royal in fant was connected by some dark affinity of lineage or country with the Macedonian Alexander No sooner was he born than the cradle of Basil his family and his city were swept away by an inundation of the Bulgarians he was educated a slave in a foreign land and in this severe discipline he acquired the hardiness of body and flexibility of mind which promoted his future elevation In the age of youth or manhood he shared the deliverance of the Roman captives who generously broke their fetters marched through Bulgaria to the shores of the Euxine de feated two armies of the barbarians embarked in the ships which had been sta OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE  251 tkmed for their reception and returned to Constantinople from whence they were distributed to their respective homes But the freedom of Basil was naked and destitute his farm was ruined by the calamities of war after his father s death his manual labour or service could no longer support a family of orphans and he resolved to seek a more conspicuous theatre in which every virtue and every vice may lead to the paths of greatness The first night of his arrival at Constantino ple without friends or money the weary pilgrim slept on the steps of the church of St Diomede he was fed by the casaal hospitality of a monk and was intro duced to the service of a cousin and a namesake of the emperor Theophilus who though himself of a diminutive person was always followed by a train of tall and handsome domestics Basil attended his patron to the government of Peloponnesus eclipsed by his personal merit the birth and dignity of Theophilus and formed a useful connexion with a wealthy and charitable matron of Patras Her spiritual or carnal love embraced the young adventurer whom she adopted as her son Danielis presented him with thirty slaves and the produce of her bounty was ex pended in the support of his brothers and the purchase of some large estates in Macedonia His gratitude or ambition still attached him to the service of The ophilus and a lucky accident recommended him to the notice of the court A fa mous wrestler in the train of the Bulgarian ambassadors had defied at the royal banquet the boldest and most robust of the Greeks The strength of Basil was praised he accepted the challenge and the barbarian champion was overthrown at the first onset A beautiful but vicious horse was condemned to be hamstrung it was subdued by the dexterity and courage of the servant of Theophilus and his conqueror was promoted to an honourable rank in the imperial stables But it was impossible to obtain the confidence of Michael without complying with his vices and his new favourite the great chamberlain of the palace was raised and supported by a disgraceful marriage with a royal concubine and the dishonour of his sister who succeeded to her place The public administration had been aban doned to the C esar Bardas the brother and enemy of Theodora but the arts of female influence persuaded Michael to hate and to fear his uncle he was drawn from Constantinople under the pretext of a Cretan expedition and stabbed in the tent of audience by the sword of the chamberlain and in the presence of the em peror About a month after this execution Basil was invested with the title of Augustus and the government of the empire He supported this unequal associa tion till his influence was fortified by popular esteem His life was endangered by the caprice of the emperor and his dignity was profaned by a second colleague who had rowed in the galleys Yet the murder of his benefactor must be con demned as an act of ingratitude and treason and the churches which he dedicated to the name of St Michael were a poor and puerile expiation of his guilt The different ages of Basil I may be compared with those of Augustus The situation of the Greek did not allow him in his earliest youth to lead an army against his country or to proscribe the noblest of her sons but his aspiring genius stooped to the arts of a slave he dissembled his ambition and even his virtues and grasped with the bloody hand of an assassin the empire which he ruled with the wisdom and tenderness of a parent A private citizen may feel his interest repug nant to his duty but it must be from a deficiency of sense or courage that an ab solute monarch can separate his happiness from his glory or his glory from the public welfare The life or panegyric of Basil has indeed been composed and published under the long reign of his descendants but even their stability on the throne may be justly ascribed to the superior merit of their ancestor In his cha racter his grandson Constantine has attempted to delineate a perfect image of royalty but that feeble prince unless he had copied a real model could not ea sily have soared above the level of his own conduct or conceptions But the most solid praise of Basil is drawn from the comparison of a ruined and a flourishing monarchy that which he wrested from the dissolute Michael and that which he bequeathed to the Macedonian dynasty The evils which had been sanctified by time and example were corrected by his master hand and he revived if not the national spirit at least the order and majesty of the Roman empire His appli cation was indefatigable his temper cool his understanding vigorous and decisive and in his practice he observed that rare and salutary moderation which pursues each virtue at an equal distance between the opposite vices His military service liad been confined to the palace nor was the emperor endowed with the spirit or the talents of a warrior Yet under his reign the Roman arms were again formi dable to the barbarians As soon as he had formed a new army by discipline and THE DECLINE AND FALL exercise he appeared in person on the banks of the Euphrates curbed the pride of the Saracens and suppressed the dangerous though just revolt of the Mani chacans His indignation against a rebel who had long eluded his pursuit pro voked him to wish and to pray that by the grace of God he might drive three arrows into the head of Chrysochir That odious head which had been obtained by treason rather than by valour was suspended from a tree and thrice exposed to the dexterity of the imperial archer a base revenge against the dead more worthy of the times than of the character of Basil But hisprincipal merit was in the civil administration of the finances and of the laws To replenish an ex hausted treasury it was proposed to resume the lavish and ill placed gifts of his predecessors his prudence abated one moiety of the restitution and a sum of 3 200 000 was instantly procured to answer the most pressing demands and to allow some space for the mature operations of economy Among the various schemes for the improvement of the revenue a new mode was suggested of capi tation or tribute which would have too much depended on the arbitrary discre tion of the assessors A sufficient list of honest and able agents was instantly pro duced by the minister but on the more careful scrutiny of Basil himself only two could be found who might be safely intrusted with such dangerous powers and they justified his esteem by declining his confidence But the serious and success ful diligence of the emperor established by degrees an equitable balance of pro perty and payment of receipt and expenditure a peculiar fund was appropriated to each service and a public method secured the interest of the prince and the property of the people After reforming the luxury he assigned two patrimonial estates to supply the decent plenty of the imperial table the contributions of the subject were reserved for his defence and the residue was employed in the em bellishment of the capital and provinces A taste for building however costly may deserve some praise and much excuse from thence industry is fed art is en couraged and some object is attained of public emolument or pleasure the use of a road an aqueduct or a hospital is obvious and solid and the hundred churches that arose by the command of Basil were consecrated to the devotion of the age In the character of a judge he was assiduous and impartial desirous to save but not afraid to strike the oppressors of the people were severely chastised but his personal foes whom it might be unsafe to pardon were condemned after the loss of their eyes to a life of solitude and repentance The change of language and manners demanded a revision of the obsolete jurisprudence of Justinian the vo luminous body of his institutes pandects code and novels was digested under forty titles in the Greek idiom and the Basilica which were improved and com pleted by his son and grandson must be referred to the original genius of the founder of their race This glorious reign was terminated by at accident in the chase A furious stag entangled his horns in the belt of Basil and raised him from his horse he was rescued by an attendant who cut the belt and slew the ani mal but the fall or the fever exhausted the strength of the aged monarch and he expired in the palace amidst the tears of his family and people If he struck off the head of the faithful servant for presuming to draw his sword against his sovereign the pride of despotism which had lain dormant in his life revived in the last moments of despair when he no longer wanted or valued the opinion of mankind Of the four sons of the emperor Constantine died before his father whose grief and credulity were amused by a flattering impostor and a vain apparition Ste Ehen the youngest was content with the honours of a patriarch and a saint both eo and Alexander were alike invested with the purple but the powers of govern ment were solely exercised by the elder brother The name of Leo VI has been dignified with the title of fihiloso iker and the union of the prince and the sage of the active and speculative virtues would indeed constitute the perfection of human nature _ But the claims of Leo are far short of this ideal excellence Did he reduce his passions and appetites under the dominion of reason  His life was spent in the pomp of the palace in the society of his wives and concubines and even the cle mency which he showed and the peace which he strove to preserve must be im puted to the softness and indolence of his character Did he subdue his prejudices and those of his subjects His mind was tinged with the most puerile superstition the influence of the clergy and the errors of the people were consecrated by his laws and the oracles of Leo which reveal in prophetic style the fates of the em pire are founded on the arts of astrology and divination If we still inquire the rea son of his sage appellation it can onl v be replied that the son of Basil was less igno OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE rant than the greater part of his cotemporaries in church and state that his edu cation had been directed by the learned Photius and that several books of profane and ecclesiastical science were composed by the pen or in the name of the im perial fihilosofiher But the reputation of his philosophy and religion was over thrown by a domestic vice the reputation of his nuptials The primitive ideas of the merit and holiness of celibacy were preached by the monks and entertained by the Greeks Marriage was allowed as a necessary means for the propagation of mankind after the death of either party the survivor might satisfy by a se cond union the weakness or the strength of the flesh but a third marriage was censured as a state of legal fornication and a fourth was a sin or scandal yet un known to the Christians of the east In the beginning of his reign Leo himself had abolished the state of concubines and condemned without annulling third marriages but his patriotism and love soon compelled him to violate his own laws and to incur the penance which in a similar case he had imposed on his subjects In his three first alliances his nuptial bed was unfruitful the emperor required a female companion and the empire a legitimate heir The beautiful Zoe was in troduced into the palace as a concubine and after a trial of her fecundity and the birth of Constantine her lover declared his intention of legitimating the mother and the child by the celebration of his fourth nuptials But the patriarch Nicho las refused his blessing the imperial baptism of the young prince was obtained by a promise of separation and the contumacious husband of Zoe was excluded from the communion of the faithful Neither the fear of exile nor the desertion of his brethren nor the authority of the Latin church nor the danger of failure or doubt in the succession to the empire could bend the spirit of the inflexible monk Af ter the death of Leo he was recalled from exile to the civil and ecclesiastical ad ministration and the edict of union which was promulgated in the name of Con stantine condemned the future scandal of fourth marriages and left a tacit impu tation on his own birth In the Greek language fiurfile and fiorfihyry are the same word and as the co lours of nature are invariable we may learn that a dark deep red was the Tyrian dye which stained the purple of the ancients An apartment of the Byzantine palace was lined with porphyry it was reserved for the use of the pregnant em presses and the royal birth of their children was expressed by the appellation of porfihyrogenite or born in the purple Several of the Roman princes had been blessed with an heir but this peculiar surname was first applied to Constantine VEL His life and titular reign were of equal duration but of fifty four years six had elapsed before his father s death and the son of Leo was ever the voluntary or reluctant subject of those who oppressed his weakness or abused his confidence His uncle Alexander who had long been invested with the title of Augustus was the first colleague and governor of the young prince but in a rapid career of vice and folly the brother of Leo already emulated the reputation of Michael and when he was extinguished by a timely death he entertained a project of castrating his nephew and leaving the empire to a worthless favourite The succeeding years of the minority of Constantine were occupied by his mother Zoe and a suc cession of councils of seven regents who pursued their interest gratified their pas sions abandoned the republic supplanted each other and finally vanished hr the wesence of a soldier From an obscure origin Romanus Lecapenus had raised limself to the command of the naval armies and in the anarchy of the times had deserved or at least had obtained the national esteem With a victorious and af fectionate fleet he sailed from the mouth of the Danube into the harbour of Con stantinople and was hailed as the deliverer of the people and the guardian of the prince His supreme office was at first defined by the new appellation of father of the emperor but Romanus soon disdained the subordinate powers of a minister and assumed with the titles of Gsesar and Augustus the full independence of roy alty which he held near five and twenty years His three sons Christopher Stephen and Constantine were successively adorned with the same honours and the lawful emperor was degraded from the first to the fifth rank in this college of princes Yet in the preservation of his life and crown he might still applaud his own fortune and the clemency of the usurper The examples of ancient and modern history would have excused the ambition of Romanus the powers and the laws of the empire were in his hand the spurious birth of Constantine would have justi fied his exclusion and the grave or the monastery was open to receive the son of the concubine But Lecapenus does not appear to have possessed either the virtues or the vices of a tyrant The spirit and activity of his private life dissolved away THE DECLINE AND FALL in the sunshine of the throne and in his licentious pleasures he forgot the safety both of the republic and of his family Of a mild and religious character he re spected the sanctity of oaths the innocence of the youth the memory of his parents and the attachment of the people The studious temper and retirement of Con stantine disarmed the jealousy of power his books and music his pen and his pen cil were a constant source of amusement and if he could improve a scanty allow ance by the sale of his pictures if their price was not enhanced by the name of the artist he was endowed with a personal talent which few princes could employ in the hour of adversity The fall of Romanus was occasioned by his own vices and those of his children After the decease of Christopher his eldest son the two surviving brothers quar relled with each other and conspired against their father At the hour of noon when all strangers were regularly excluded from the palace they entered his apartment with an armed force and conveyed him in the habit of a monk to a small island in the Propontis which was peopled by a religious community The rumour of this domestic revolution excited a tumult in the city but Porphyroge nitus alone the true and lawful emperor was the object of the public care and the sons of Lecapenus were taught by tardy experience that they had achieved a guilty and perilous enterprise for the benefit of their rival Their sister Hele na the wife of Constantine revealed or supposed their treacherous design of as sassinating her husband at the royal banquet His royal adherents were alarmed and the two usurpers were prevented seized degraded from the purple and em barked for the same island and monastery where their father had been so lately confined Old Romanus met them on the beach with a sarcastic smile and after a just reproach of their folly and ingratitude presented his imperial colleagues with an equal share of his water and vegetable diet In the fortieth year of his reign Constantine VII obtained the possession of the eastern world which he ruled or seemed to ru e iiear fifteen years But he was devoid of that energy of character which could emerge into a life of action and lory and the studies which had amused and dignified his leisure were incompatible with the serious duties of a sovereign The emperor neglected the practice to instruct his son Romanus in the theory of government while he indulged the habits of intemperance and sloth he dropped the reins of the administration into the hands of Helena his wife and in the shifting scene of her favour and caprice each minister was regretted in the promotion of a more worthless successor Yet the birth and misfortunes of Con stantine had endeared him to the Greeks they excused his failings they respected his learning his innocence and charity his love of justice and the ceremony of his funeral was mourned with the unfeigned tears of his subjects The body ac cording to ancient custom lay in state in the vestibule of the palace and the civil and military officers the patricians the senate and the clergy approached in due order to adore and kiss the inanimate corpse of their sovereign Before the procession moved towards the imperial sepulchre a herald proclaimed this awful admonition â Arise O king of the world and obey the summons of the King of kings The death of Constantine was imputed to poison and his son Romanus who de rived that name from his maternal grandfather ascended the throne of Constanti nople A prince who at the age of twenty could be suspected of anticipating his inheritance must have been already lost in the public esteem yet Romanus was rather weak than wicked and the largest share of the guilt was transferred to his wife Theophano a woman of base origin masculine spirit and flagitious man ners The sense of personal glory and public happiness the true pleasures of royalty were unknown to the son of Constantine and while the two brothers Ni cephorus and Leo triumphed over the Saracens the hours which the emperor owed to his people were consumed in strenuous idleness In the morning he visit ed the circus at noon he feasted the senators the greater part of the afternoon he spent in the Sfiharisterium or tennis court the only theatre of his victories from thence he passed over to the Asiatic side of the Bosphorus hunted and killed four wild boars of the largest size and returned to the palace proudly content with the labours of the day In strength and beauty he was conspicuous above his equals tall and straight as a young cypress his complexion was fair and florid his eyes sparkling his shoulders broad his nose long and aquiline Yet even these per fections were insufficient to fix the love of Theophano and after a reign of four years she mingled for her husband the same deadly draught which she had com posed for his father  OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE qs By his marriage with this impious woman Romanus the younger left two sons Basil II and Constantine IX and two daughters Theophano and Anne The eldest sister was given to Otho II emperor of the west the younger became the wife of Wolodomir great duke and apostle of Russia and by the marriage of her grand daughter with Henry I king of France the blood of the Macedonians and perhaps of the Arsacides still flows in the veins of the Bourbon line After the death of her husband the empress aspired to reign in the name of her sons the elder of whom was five and the younger only two years of age but she soon felt the instability of a throne which was supported by a female who could not be es teemed and two infants who could not be feared Theophano looked around for a protector and threw herself into the arms of the bravest soldier her heart was capricious but the deformity of the new favourite rendered it more probable that interest was the motive and excuse of her love Nicephorus Phocas united in the popular opinion the double merit of a hero and a saint In the former character his qualifications were genuine and splendid the descendant of a race illustrious by their military exploits he had displayed in every station and in every pro vince the courage of a soldier and the conduct of a chief and Nicephorus was crowned with recent laurels from the important conquest of the isle of Crete His religion was of a more ambiguous cast and his hair cloth his fasts his pious idiom and his wish to retire from the business of the world were a convenient mask for his dark and dangerous ambition Yet he imposed on a holy patriarch by whose influence and by a decree of the senate he was intrusted during the minority of the young princes with the absolute and independent command of the oriental armies As soon as he had secured the leaders and the troops he boldly marched to Constantinople trampled on his enemies avowed his correspondence with the empress and without degrading her sons assumed with the title of Augustus the pre eminence of rank and the plenitude of power But his marriage with Theophano was refused by the same patriarch who had placed the crown on his head by his second nuptials he incurred a year of canonical penance a bar of spiritual affinity was opposed to their celebration and some evasion and perjury were required to silence the scruples of the clergy and people The popularity of the emperor was lost in the purple in a reign of six years he provoked the ha tred of strangers and subjects and the hypocrisy and avarice of the first Nice phorus were revived in his successor Hypocrisy I shall never justify or palliate but I will dare to observe that the odious vice of avarice is of all others most hastily arraigned and most unmercifully condemned In a private citizen ouy judgment seldom expects an accurate scrutiny into his fortune and expense and in a steward of the public treasure frugality is always a virtue and the increase of taxes too often an indispensable duty In the use of his patrimony the generous temper of Nicephorus had been proved and the revenue was strictly applied to the service of the state each spring the emperor marched in person against the Saracens and every Roman might compute the employment of his taxes in tri umphs conquests and the security of the eastern barrier Among the warriors who promoted his elevation and served under his standard a noble and Valiant Armenian had deserved and obtained the most eminent re wards The statue of John Zimisces was below the ordinary standard but this diminutive body was endowed with strength beauty and the soul of a hero By the jealousy of the emperor s brother he was degraded from the office of general of the east to that of director of the posts and his murmurs were chastised with disgrace and exile But Zimisces was ranked among the numerous lovers of the empress on her intercession he was permitted to reside at Chalcedon in the neigh bourhood of the capital her bounty was repaid in his clandestine and amorous visits to the palace and Theophano consented with alacrity to the death of an ugly and penurious husband Some bold and trusty conspirators were concealed in her most private chambers in the darkness of a winter night Zimisces with his principal companions embarked in a small boat traversed the Bosphorus landed at the palace stairs and silently ascended a ladder of ropes which was cast down by the female attendants Neither his own suspicions nor the warnings of his friends nor the tardy aid of his brother Leo nor the fortress which he had erected in the palace could protect Nicephorus from a domestic foe at whose voice every door was opened to the assassins As he slept on a bear skin on the ground ho was roused by their noisy intrusion and thirty daggers glittered before his eyes It is doubtful whether Zimisces imbrued his hands in the blood of his sovereign but he enjoyed the inhuman spectacle of revenge The murder was protracted by insult S5 THE DECLINE AND FALL and cruelty and as soon as the head of Nicephorus was shown from the window the tumult was hushed and the Armenian was emperor of the east On the day of his coronation he was stopped on the threshold of St Sophia by the intrepid patriarch who charged his conscience with the deed of treason and blood and re quired as a sign of repentance that he should separate himself from his more criminal associate This sally of apostolic zeal was not offensive to the prince since he could neither love nor trust a wom n who had repeatedly violated the most sacred obligations and Theophano instead of sharing his imperial fortune was dismissed with ignominy from his bed and palace In their last interview she displayed a frantic and impotent rage accused the ingratitude of her lover as saulted with words and blows her son Basil as he stood silent and submissive in the presence of a superior colleague and avowed her own prostitution in proclaim ing the illegitimacy of his birth The public indignation was appeased by her exile and the punishment of the meaner accomplices the death of an unpopular prince was forgiven and the guilt of Zimisces was forgotten in the splendour of his virtues Perhaps his profusion was less useful to the state than the avarice of Nicephorus but his gentle and generous behaviour delighted all who approached his person and it was only in the paths of victory that he trod in the footsteps of his predecessor The greatest part of his reign was employed in the camp and the field his personal valour and activity were signalized on the Danube and the Ti gris the ancient boundaries of the Roman world and by his double triumph over the Russians and the Saracens he deserved the titles of saviour of the empire and conqueror of the east In his last return from Syria he observed that the most fruitful lands of his new provinces were possessed by the eunuchs And is it for them he exclaimed with honest indignation that we have fought and con quered Is it for them that we shed our blood and exhaust the treasures of our people The complaint was re echoed to the palace and the death of Zimisces is strongly marked with the suspicion of poison Under this usurpation or regency of twelve years the two lawful emperors Basil and Constantine had silently grown to the age of manhood Their tender years had been incapable of dominion the respectful modesty of their attendance smd salutation was due to the age and merit of their guardians the childless am bition of those guardians had no temptation to violate their right of succession their patrimony was ably and faithfully administered and the premature death of Zi misces was a loss rather than a benefit to the sons of Romanus Their want of experience detained them twelve years longer the obscure and voluntary pupils of a minister who extended his reign by persuading them to indulge the pleasures of youth and to disdain the labours of government In this silken web the weakness of Constantine was for ever entangled but his elder brother felt the impulse of genius and the desire of action he frowned and the minister was no more Basil â was the acknowledged sovereign of Constantinople and the provinces of Europe but Asia was oppressed by two veteran generals Phocas and Sclerus who alter nately friends and enemies subjects and rebels maintained their independence and laboured to emulate the example of successful usurpation Against these domestic enemies the son of Romanus first drew his sword and they trembled in the presence of a lawful and high spirited prince The first in the front of battle â was thrown from his horse by the stroke of poison or an arrow the second who had been twice loaded with chains and twice invested with the purple was de sirous of ending in peace the small remainder of his days As the aged suppliant approached the throne with dim eyes and faltering steps leaning on his two at tendants the emperor exclaimed in the insolence of youth and power â And is this the man who has so long been the object of our terror After he had con firmed his own authority and the peace of the empire the trophies of Nicephorus and Zimisces would not suffer their royal pupil to sleep in the palace His long and frequent expeditions against the Saracens were rather glorious than useful to the empire but the final destruction of the kingdom of Bulgaria appears since the time of Belisarius the most important triumph of the Roman arms Yet instead of applauding their victorious prince his subjects detested the rapacious and rigid avarice of Basil and in the imperfect narrative of his exploits We can only discern the courage patience and ferociousness of a soldier A vicious education tvhich could not subdue his spirit had clouded his mind he was ignorant of every science and the remembrance of his learned and feeble grandsire might encourage a real or affected contempt of laws and lawyers of artists and arts Of such a character in such an age superstition took a firm ajid lasting possession after the OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE first license of his youth Basil II devoted his life in the palace and the camp to the penance of a hermit wore the monastic habit under his robes and armour ob served a vow of continence and imposed on his appetites a perpetual abstinence from wine and flesh In the sixty eighth year of his age his martial spirit urged him to embark in person for a holy war against the Saracens of Sicily he was pre vented by death and Basil surnamed the slayer of the Bulgarians was dismissed from the world with the blessings of the clergy and the curses of the people After his decease his brother Constantine enjoyed about three years the power or rather the pleasures of royalty and his only care was the settlement of his suc cession He had enjoyed sixty six years the title of Augustus and the reign of the two brothers is the longest and most obscure of the Byzantine history A lineal succession of five emperors in a period of one hundred and sixty years had attached the loyalty of the Greeks to the Macedonian dynasty which had been thrice respected by the usurpers of their power After the death of Con stantine IX the last male of the royal race a new and broken scene presented it self and the accumulated years of twelve emperors do not equal the space of his single reign His elder brother had preferred his private chastity to the public interest and Constantine himself had only three daughters Eudocia who took the veil and Zoe and Theodora who were preserved till a mature age in a state of ignorance and virginity When their marriage was discussed in the council of their dying father the cold or pious Theodora refused to give an heir to the em pire but her sister Zoe presented herself a willing victim at the altar Romanus Argyrus a patrician of a graceful person and fair reputation was chosen for her husband and on his declining that honour was informed that blindness or death Was the second alfernative The motive of his reluctance was conjugal affection but his faithful wife sacrificed her own happiness to his safety and greatness and her entrance into a monastery removed the only bar to the imperial nuptials Af ter the decease of Constantine the sceptre devolved to Romanus III but his la bours at home and abroad were equally feeble and fruitless and the mature age the forty eight years of Zoe were less favourable to the hopes of pregnancy than to the indulgence of pleasure Her favourite chamberlain was a handsome Paph lagonian of the name of Michael whose first trade had been that of a money chan ger and Romanus either from gratitude or equity connived at their criminal in tercourse or accepted a slight assurance of their innocence But Zoe soon justi fied the Roman maxim that every adulteress is capable of poisoning her husband and the death of Romanus was instantly followed by the scandalous marriage and elevation of Michael IV The expectations of Zoe were however disappointed instead of a vigorous and grateful lover she had placed in her bed a miserable wretch whose health and reason were impaired bv epileptic fits and whose con science was tormented by despair and remorse The most skilful physicians of the mind and body were summoned to his aid and his hopes were amused by fre quent pilgrimages to the baths and to the tombs of the most popular saints the monks applauded his penance and except restitution but to whom should he have restored Michael sought every method of expiating his guilt While he groaned and prayed in sackcloth and ashes his brother the eunuch John smiled at his re morse and enjoyed the harvest of a crime of which himself was the secret and most guilty author His administration was only the art of satiating his avarice and Zoe became a captive in the palace of her fathers and in the hands of her slaves When he perceived the irretrievable decline of his brother s health he introduced his nephew another Michael who derived his surname of Calaphates from his father s occupation in the careening of vessels at the command of the eunuch Zoe adopted for her son the son of a mechanic and the fictitious heir was invested with the title and purple of the Ciesars in the presence of the senate and clergy So feeble was the characterof Zoe that she was oppressed by the liberty and power which he recovered by the death of the Paphlagonian and at the end of four days she placed the crown on the head of Michael V who had protested with tears and oaths that he should ever reign the first and most obedient of hey subjects The only act of his short reign was his base ingratitude to his benefactors the eunuch and the empress The disgrace of the former was pleasing to the pub lic but the murmurs and at length the clamours of Constantinople deplored the exile of Zoe the daughter of so many emperors her vices were forgotten and Michael was taught that there is a period in which the patience of the tamest slaves rises into fury and revenge The citizens of everv degree assembled in a Vol III 33 THE DECLINE AND FALL formidable tumult which lasted three days they besieged the palace forced the gates recalled their mothers Zoe from her prison Theodora from her monastery and condemned the son of Calaphates to the loss of his eyes or of his rife For the first time the Greeks beheld with surprise the two royal sisters seated on the same throne presiding in the senate and giving audience to the ambassadors of the nations But this singular union subsisted no more than two months the two sovereigns their tempers interests and adherents were secretly hostile to each other and as Theodora was still averse to marriage the indefatigable Zoe at the age of sixty consented for the public good to sustain the embraces of a third husband and the censures of the Greek church His name and number were Constantine X and the epithet of Monomachus the single combatant must have been expressive of his valour and victory in some public or private quarrel But his health was broken by the tortures of the gout and his dissolute reign was spent in the alternative of sickness and pleasure A fair and noble widow had accom panied Constantine in his exile to the isle of Lesbos and Sclerena gloried in the appellation of his mistress After his marriage and elevation she was invested with the title and pomp of Augusta and occupied a contiguous apartment in the palace  The lawful consort such was the delicacy or corruption of Zoe consent ed to this strange and scandalous partition and the emperor appeared in public be tween his wife and his concubine He survived them both but the last measures of Constantine to change the order of succession were prevented by the more vi gilant friends of Theodora and after his decease she resumed with the general consent the possession of her inheritance In her name and by the influence of four eunuchs the eastern world was peaceably governed about nineteen months and as they wished to prolong their dominion they persuaded tTle aged princess to nominate for her successor Michael VI The surname of Stratioticus declares his military profession but the crazy and decrepit veteran could only see with the eyes and execute with the hands of his ministers Whilst he ascended the throne Theodora sunk into the grave the last of the Macedonian or Basilian dynasty I have hastily reviewed and gladly dismiss this shameful and destructive period of twenty eight years in which the Greeks degraded below the common level of servitude were transferred like a herd of cattle by the choice or caprice of two impotent females From this night of slavery a ray of freedom or at least of spirit begins to emerge the Greeks either preserved or revived the use of surnames which per petuate the fame of hereditary virtue and we now discern the rise succession and alliance of the last dynasties of Constantinople and Trebizond The Com Tteni who upheld for awhile the fate of the sinking empire assumed the honour of a Roman origin but the family had been long since transported from Italy to Asia Their patrimonial estate was situate in the district of Castamona in the neighbourhood of the Euxine and one of their chiefs who had already entered the paths of ambition revisited with affection perhaps with regret the mo dest though honourable dwelling of his fathers The first of their line was the illustrious Manuel who in the reign of the second Basil contributed by war and treaty to appease the troubles of the east he left in a tender age twosons Isaac and John whom with the consciousness of desert he bequeathed to the gratitude and favour of his sovereign The noble youths were carefully trained in the learn ing of the monastery the arts of the palace and the exercises of the camp and from the domestic service of the guards they were rapidly promoted to the com mand of provinces and armies Their fraternal union doubled the force and re putation of Comneni and their ancient nobility was illustrated by the marriage of the two brothers with a captive princess of Bulgaria and the daughter of a patri cian who had obtained the name of Charon from the number of enemies whom he had sent to the infernal shades The soldiers had served with reluctant loyal ty a series of effeminate masters the elevation of Michael VI was a personal in sult to the more deserving generals and their discontent was inflamed by the par simony of the emperor and the insolence of the eunuchs They secretly assem bled in the sanctuary of St Sophia and the votes of the military synod would have been unanimous in favour of the old and valiant Catacalon if the patriotism or modesty of the veteran had not suggested the importance of birth as well as me rit in the choice of a sovereign Isaac Comnenusnvas approved by general con sent and the associates separated without delay to meet in the plains of Phrygia at the head of their respective squadrons and detachments The cause of Mi chael was defended in a sipgle battle by the mercenaries of the imperial guard who were aliens to the public interest and animated only by a principle of honour OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 259 and gratitude After their defeat the fears of the emperor solicited a treaty which was almost accepted by the moderation of the Comnenian But the former was betrayed by his ambassadors and the latter was prevented by his friends The solitary Michael submitted to the voice of the people the patriarch annulled their oath of allegiance and as he shaved the head of the royal monk congra tulated his beneficial exchange of temporal royalty for the kingdom of heaven an exchange however which the priest on his own account would probably have declined By the hands of the same patriarch Isaac Comnenus was solemnly crowned the sword which he inscribed on his coins might be an offensive symbol it it implied his title by conquest but this sword would have been drawn against the foreign and domestic enemies of the state The decline of his health and vi gour suspended the operation of active virtue and the prospect of approaching death determined him to interpose some moments between life and eternity But instead of leaving the empire as the marriage portion of his daughter his reason and inclination concurred in the preference of his brother John a soldier a pa triot and the father of five sons the future pillars of an hereditary succession His first nicest reluctance might be the natural dictates of discretion and tender ness but his obstinate and successful perseverance however it may dazzle with the show of virtue must be censured as a criminal desertion of his duty and a rare offence against his family and countiy The purple which he had refused was accepted by Constantine Ducas a friend of the Comnenian house and whose noble birth was adorned with the experience and reputation of civil policy In the monastic habit Isaac recovered his health and survived two years his volun tary abdication At the command of his abbot he observed the rule of St Basil and executed the most servile offices of the convent but his latent vanity was gra tified by the frequent and respectful visits of the reigning monarch who revered in his person the character of a benefactor and a saint If Constantine XI were indeed the subject most worthy of empire we must pity the debasement of the age and nation in which he was chosen In the labour of puerile declamations he sought without obtaining the crown of eloquence more precious in his opinion than that of Rome and in the subordinate functions of a judge he forgot the duties of a sovereign and a warrior Far from imitating the patriotic indifference of the authors of his greatness Ducas was anxious only to se cure at the expense of the republic the power and prosperity of his children His three sons Michael VII Andronicus I and Constantine XII were invested in a tender age with the equal title of Augustus and the succession was speedily opened by their father s death His widow Eudocia was intrusted with the ad ministration but experience had taught the jealousy of the dying monarch to pro tect his sons from the danger of her second nuptials and her solemn engagement attested by the principal senators was deposited in the hands of the patriarch Before the end of seven months the wants of Eudocia or those of the state called aloud for the male virtues of a soldier and her heart had already chosen Roma nus Diogenes whom she raised from the scaffold to the throne  The discovery of a treasonable attempt had exposed hinVto the severity of the laws his beauty and valour absolved him in the eyes of the empress and Romanus from a mild exile was recalled on the second day to the command of the oriental armies Her royal choice was yet unknown to the public and the promise which would have betrayed her falsehood and levity was stolen by a dexterous emissary from the ambition of the patriarch Xiphilin at first alleged the sanctity of oaths and the sacred nature of a trust but a whisper that his brother was the future emperor relaxed his scruples and forced him to confess that the public safety was the su preme law He resigned the important paper and when his hopes were con founded by the nomination of Romanus he could no longer regain his security re tract his declarations nor oppose the second nuptials of the empress Yet a mur mur was heard in the palace and the barbarian guards had raised their battle axes in the cause of the house of Ducas till the young princes were soothed by the tears of their mother and the solemn assurances of the fidelity of their guardian who filled the imperial station with dignity and honour Hereafter I shall relate his valiant but unsuccessful efforts to resist the progress of the Turks His defeat and captivity inflicted a deadly wound on the Byzantine monarchy of the east and after he was released from the chains of the sultan he vainly sought his wife and his subjects His wife had been thrust into a monastery and the subjects of Ro manus had embraced a rigid maxim of the civil law that a prisoner in the hands of the enemy is deprived as by the stroke of death of all the public and private JtjO THE DECLINE AND FALL rights of a citiaen In the general consternation the Caesar John asserted the in defeasible right of his three nephews Constantinople listened to his voice and the Turkish captive was proclaimed in the capital and received on the frontier as an enemy of the republic Romanus was not more fortunate in domestic than in fo reign war the loss of two battles compelled him to yield on the assurance of fair and honourable treatment but his enemies were devoid of faith or humanity and after the cruel extinction of his sight his wounds were left to bleed and corrupt till in a few days he was relieved from a state of misery Under the triple reign of the house of Ducas the two younger brothers were reduced to the vain honours of the purple but the eldest the pusillanimous Michael was incapable of sustain ing the Roman sceptre and his surname of Sdrafiinaces denotes the reproach which he shared with an avaricious favourite who enhanced the price and di minished the measure of wheat In the school of Pselhis and after the example of his mother the son of Eudocia made some proficiency in philosophy and rheto ric but his character was degraded rather than ennobled by the virtues of a monk and the learning o f a sophist Strong in the contempt of their sovereign and their own esteem two generals at the head of the European and Asiatic le gions assumed the purple at Adrianople and Nice Their revolt was in the same month they bore the same name of Nicephorus but the two candidates were dis tinguished by the surnames of Bryennius and Botaniates the former in the matu rity of wisdom and courage the latter conspicuous only by the memory of his past exploits While Botaniates advanced with cautious and dilatory steps his active competitor stood in arms before the gates of Constantinople The name of Bry ennius was illustrious his cause was popular but his licentious troops could not be restrained from burning and pillaging a suburb and the people who would have hailed the rebel rejected and repulsed the incendiary of his country This change of the public opinion was favourable to Botaniates who at length with an army of Turks approached the shores of Chalcedon A formal invitation in the name of the patriarch the synod and the senate was circulated through the streets of Constantinople and the general assembly in the dome of St Sophia debated with order and calmness on the choice of their sovereign The guards of Michael would have dispersed this unarmed multitude but the feeble emperor applauding his own moderation and clemency resigned the ensigns of royalty and was re warded with a monastic habit and the title of archbishop of Ephesus He left a son a Constantine born and educated in the purple and a daughter of the house of Ducas illustrated the blood and confirmed the succession of the Comnenian dynasty John Comnerius the brother of the emperor Isaac survived in peace and dig nity his generous refusal of the sceptre By his wife Anne a woman of masculine spirit and policy he left eight children the three daughters multiplied the Com nenian alliances with the noblest of the Greeks of the five sons Manuel was stopped by a premature death Isaac and Alexius restored the imperial greatness of their house which was enjoyed without toil or danger by the two younger bre thren Adrian and Nicephorus Alexius the third and most illustrious of the brothers was endowed by nature with the choicest gifts both of mind and body they were cultivated by a liberal education and exercised in the school of obedi ence and adversity The youth was dismissed from the perils of the Turkish war by the paternal care of the emperor Romanus but the mother of the Com peni with her aspiring race was accused of treason and banished by the sons of Ducas to an island in the Propontis The two brothers soon emerged into favour and action fought by each other s side against the rebels and barbarians and ad hered to the emperor Michael till he was deserted by the world and by himself In his first interview with Botaniates  Prince said Alexius with a noble frank ness my duty rendered me your enemy the decrees of God and of the people have made me your subject Judge of my future loyalty by my past opposition The successor of Michael entertained him with esteem and confidence his valour was employed against three rebels who disturbed the peace of the emperor or at least of the emperors Ursel Bryennius and Basilacius were formidable by their numerous forces and military fame they were successively vanquished in the field and led in chains to the foot of the throne and whatever treatment they might re ceive from a timid and cruel court they applauded the clemency as well as the courage of the conqueror But the loyalty of the Comneni was soon tainted by fear and suspicion nor is it easy to settle between a subject and a despot the debt of gratitude which tne former is tempted to claim by a revolt and the latter to OS THE ROHAN EMPIRE 361 discharge by an executioner The refusal of Alexius to march against a fourth rebel the husband of his sister destroyed the merit or memory of his past services the favourites of Botaniates provoked the ambition which they apprehended and accused and the retreat of tne two brothers might be justified by the defence of their life or liberty The women of the family were deposited in a sanctuary respected by tyrants the men mounted on horseback sallied from the city and erected the standard of civil war The soldiers who had been gradually assem bled in the capital and tne neighbourhood were devoted to the cause of a victori ous and injured leaden the ties of common interest and domestic alliance secured the attachment of the house of Ducas and the generous dispute of the Comneni was terminated by the decisive resolution of Isaac who was the first to invest his younger brother with the name and ensigns of royalty They returned to Con stantinople to threaten rather than besiege that impregnable fortress but the fidelity of the guards was corrupted a gate was surprised and the fleet was occu pied by the active courage of George Pelzologus who fought against his father without foreseeing that he laboured for his posterity Alexius ascended the throne and his aged competitor disappeared in a monastery An army of various nations was gratified with the pillage of the city but the public disorders were expiated by the tears and fasts of the Comneni who submitted to every penance compatible with the possession of the empire The life of the emperor Alexius had been delineated by a favourite daughter who was inspired by a tender regard for his person and a laudable zeal to perpe tuate his virtues Conscious of the just suspicion of her readers the princess Anna Comnena repeatedly protests that besides her personal knowledge she had searched the discourse and writings of the most respectable veterans that after an interval of thirty years forgotten by and forgetful of the world her mournful soli tude was inaccessible to hope and fear and that truth the naked perfect truth was more dear and sacred than the memory of her parent Yet instead of the simpli city of style and narrative which wins our belief an elaborate affectation of rhetoric and science betrays in every page the vanity of a female author The genuine character of Alexius is lost in a vague constellation of virtues and the perpetual strain of panegyric and apology awakens our jealousy to question the veracity of the historian and the merit of the hero We cannot however refuse her judi cious and important remark that the disorders of the times were the misfortune and the glory of Alexius and that every calamity which can afflict a declining em pire was accumulated on his reign by the justice of Heaven and the vices of his predecessors In the east the victorious Turks had spread from Persia to Hel lespont the reign of the Koran and the crescent the west was invaded by the ad venturous valour of the Normans and in the moments of peace the Danube Eoured forth new swarms who had gained in the science of war what they had t in the ferociousness of manners The sea was not less hostile than the land and while the frontiers were assaulted by an open enemy the palace was distract ed with secret treason and conspiracy On a sudden the banner of the cross was displayed by the Latins Europe has precipitated on Asia and Constantinople had almost been swept away by this impetuous deluge In the tempest Alexius steered the imperial vessel with dexterity and courage At the head of his ar mies he was bold in action skilful in stratagem patient of fatigue ready to im prove his advantages and rising from his defeats with inexhaustible vigour The discipline of the camp was revived and a new generation of men and soldiers was created by the example and the precepts of their leader In his intercourse with the Latins Alexius was patient and artful his discerning eye pervaded the new sys tem of an unknown world and I shall hereafter describe the superior policy with which he balanced the interests and passions of the champions of the first crusade In along reign of thirty seven years he subdued and pardoned the envy of his equals the laws of public and private order were restored the arts of wealth and science were cultivated the limits of the empire were enlarged in Europe and Asia and the Comnenian sceptre was transmitted to his children of the third and fourth generation Yet the difficulties of the times betrayed some defects in his charac ter and have exposed his memory to some just or ungenerous reproach The reader may possibly smile at the lavish praise which his daughter so often bestows on a flying hero the weakness or prudence of his situation might be mistaken for a want of personal courage and his political arts are branded by the Latins with the names of deceit and dissimulation The increase of the male and female branches of his family adorned the throne and secured the succession but their princely  T E DECLINE AND FALL luxury and pride offended the patricians exhausted the revenue and insulted the misery of the people Anna is a faithful witness that his happiness was destroyed and his health was broken by the cares of a public life the patience of Constan tinople was fatigued by the length and severity of his reign and before Alexius expired he had lost the love and reverence of his subjects The clergy could not forgive his application of the sacred riches to the defence of the state but they applauded his theological learning and ardent zeal for the orthodox faith which he defended with his tongue his pen and his sword His character was degraded by the superstition of the Greeks and the same inconsistent principle of human nature enjoined the emperor to found a hospital for the poor and infirm and to direct the execution of a heretic who was burnt alive in the square of St Sophia Even the sincerity of his moral and religious virtues was suspected by the persons who had passed their lives in his familiar confidence In his last hours when he was pressed by his wife Irene to alter the succession he raised his head and breathed a pious ejaculation on the vanity of this world The indignant reply of the em press may be ascribed as an epitaph on his tomb You die as you have livedâ a hypocrite It was the wish of Irene to supplant the eldest of her surviving sons in favour of her daughter the princess Anna whose philosophy would not have refused the weight of a diadem But the order of male succession was asserted by the friends of their country the lawful heir drew the royal signet from the finger of his in sensible or conscious father and the empire obeyed the master of the palace An na Comnena was stimulated by ambition and revenge to conspire against the life of her brother and when the design was prevented by the fears or scruples of her husband she passionately exclaimed that nature had mistaken the two sexes and had endowed Bryennius with the soul of a woman The two sons of Alexius John and Isaac maintained the fraternal concord the hereditary virtue of their race and the younger brother was content with the title of Sebastocr ator which approached the dignity without sharing the power of the emperor In the same person the claims of primogeniture and merit were fortunately united his swar thy complexion harsh features and diminutive stature had suggested the ironi cal surname of Calo Johannis or John the Handsome which his grateful subjects more seriously applied to the beauties of his mind After the discovery of her treason the life and fortune of Anna were justly forfeited to the laws Her life was spared by the clemency of the emperor but he visited the pomp and treasures of her palace and bestowed the rich confiscation on the most deserving of his friends That respectable friend Axuch a slave of Turkish extraction presumed to decline the gift and to intercede for the criminal his generous master applaud ed and imitated the virtue of his favourite and the reproach or complaint of an injured brother was the only chastisement of the guilty princess After this ex ample of clemency the remainder of his reign was never disturbed by conspiracy or rebellion feared by his nobles beloved by his people John was never reduced to the painful necessity of punishing or even pardoning his personal enemies During his government of twenty five years the penalty of death was abolished in the Roman empire a law of mercy most delightful to the human theorist but of which the practice in a large and vicious community is seldom consistent with the public safety Severe to himself indulgent to others chaste frugal abste mious the philosophic Marcus would have disdained the artless virtues of his suc cessor derived from his heart and not borrowed from the schools He despised and moderated the stately magnificence of the Byzantine court so oppressive to the people so contemptible to the eye of reason Under such a prince innocence had nothing to fear and merit had every thing to hope and without assuming the tyrannic office of a censor he introduced a gradual though visible reformation in the public and private manners of Constantinople The only defect of this ac complished character was the frailty of noble mindsâ the love of arms and mili tary glory Yet the frequent expeditions of John the Handsome may be justified at least in their principle bv the necessity of repelling the Turks from the Helles pont and the Bosphorus The sultan of Iconhim was confined to his capital the barbarians were driven to the mountains and the maritime provinces of Asia en joyed the transient blessings of their deliverance From Constantinople to Antioch and Aleppo he repeatedly marched at the head of a victorious army and in the sieges and battles of this holy war his Latin allies were astonished by the superior spirit and prowess of a Greek As he began to indulge the ambitious hope of re storing the ancient limits of the empire as he revolved in his mind the Euphra OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 263 tes and the Tigris the dominion of Syria and the conquest of Jerusalam the thread of his life and of the public felicity was broken by a singular accident He hunted the wild boar in the valley of Anazarbus and had fixed his javelin in the body of the furious animal but in the struggle a poisoned arrow dropped from his quiver and a slight wound in his hand which produced a mortification was fatal to the best and greatest of the Comnenian princes A premature death had swept away the two eldest sons of John the Handsome of the two survivors Isaac and Manuel his judgment or affection preferred the younger and the choice of the dying prince was ratified by the soldiers who had applauded the valour of the favourite in his Turkish war The faithful Axuch hastened to the capital secured the person of Isaac in honourable confinement and purchased with a gift of two hundred pounds of silver the leading ecclesiastics of St Sophia who possessed a decisive voice in the consecration of an emperor With his veteran and affectionate troops Manuel soon visited Constantinople his brother acquiesced in the title of Sebastocrator his subjects admired the lofty stature and martial graces of their new sovereign and listened with credulity to the flattering promise that he blended the wisdom of age with the activity and vigour of youth By the experience of his government they were taught that he emulated the spirit and shared the talents of his father whose social virtues were buried in the grave A reign of thirty seven years is filled by a perpetual though various warfare against the Turks the Christians and the hordes of the wilder ness beyond the Danube The arms of Manuel were exercised on mount Taurus in the plains of Hungary on the coast of Italy and Egypt and on the seas of Sicily and Greece the influence of his negotiations extended from Jerusalem to Rome and Russia and the Byzantine monarchy for awhile became an object of respect or terror to the powers of Asia and Europe Educated in the silk and purple of the east Manual possessed the iron temper of a soldier which cannot easily be paralleled except in the lives of Richard I of England and of Charles XII of Swe den Such was the strength and exercise in arms that Raymond surnamed the Hercules of Antioch was incapable of wielding the lance and buckler of the Greek emperor In a famous tournament he entered the lists on a fiery courser and overturned in his first career two of the stoutest of the Italian knights The first in the charge the last in the retreat his friends and his enemies alike trembled the former for his safety and the latter for their own After posting an ambuscade in a wood he rode forth in quest of some perilous adventure accompanied only by his brother and the faithful Axuch who refused to desert their sovereign Eigh teen horsemen after a short combat fled before them but the numbers of the enemy increased the march of the re enforcement was tardy and fearful and Manuel without receiving a wound cut his way through a squadron of the Turks In a battle against the Hungarians impatient of the slowness of his troops he snatched a standard from the head of the column and was the first almost alone who passed a bridge that separated him from the enemy In the same country after transporting his army beyond the Save he sent back the boats with an order under pain of death to their commander that he should leave him to conquer or die on that hostile land In the siege of Corfu towing after him a captive galley the emperor stood aloft on the poop opposing against the volley of darts and stones a large buckler and a flowing sail nor could he have escaped inevitable death had not the Sicilian admiral enjoined his archers to respect the person of a hero In one day he is said to have slain above forty of the barbarians with his own hand he returned to the camp dragging along four Turkish prisoners whom he had tied to the rings of his saddle he was ever the foremost to provoke or accept a single combat and the gigantic champions who encountered his arm were transpierced by the lance or cut asunder by the sword of the invincible Manuel The story of his exploits which appear as a model or a copy of the romances of chivalry may induce a reasonable suspicion of the veracity of the Greeks I will not to vindicate their credit endanger my own yet I may observe that in the long series of their annals Manuel is the only prince who has been the subject of similar exaggeration With the valour of a soldier he did not unite the skill or prudence of a general his victories were not productive of any permanent or useful conquest and his Turkish laurels were blasted in his last unfortunate campaign in which he lost his armies in the mountains of Pisidia and owed his deliverance to the generosity of the sultan But the most singular feature in the character of Manuel is the con trast of labour and sloth of hardiness and effeminacy In war he seemed igno rant of peace in peace he appeared incapable of war In the field he slept in the sun or in the snow tired in the longest marches the strength of his men and horses 264 THE DECLINE AND FALL and shared with a smile the abstinence or diet of the camp No sooner did he re turn to Constantinople than he resigned himself to the arts and pleasures of a life of luxury the expense of his dress his table and his palace surpassed the mea sure of his predecessors and whole summer days were idly wasted in the delicious isles of the Propontis in the incestuous love of his niece Theodora The double coast of a warlike and dissolute prince exhausted the revenue and multiplied the taxes and Manuel in the distress of his last Turkish camp endured a bitter reproach from the mouth of a desperate soldier As he quenched his thirst he complained that the water of a fountain was mingled with Christian blood  It is not the first time exclaimed a voice from the crowd  that you have drank O emperor the blood of your Christian subjects Manuel Comnenus was twice married to the virtuous Bertha or Irene of Germany and to the beauteous Maria a French or Latin princess of Antioch The only daughter of his first wife destined for Bela a Hungarian prince who was educated at Constantinople under the name of Alexius and the consummation of their nuptials might have transferred the Roman sceptre to a race of free and warlike barbarians But as soon as Maria of Antioch had given a son and heir to the empire the presumptive rights of Bela were abolished and he was deprived of his promised bride but the Hungarian prince resumed his name and the kingdom of his fathers and displayed such vir tues as might excite the regret and envy of the Greeks The son of Maria was named Alexius and at the age of ten years he ascended the Byzantine throne after his father s decease had closed the glories of the Comnenian line The fraternal concord of the two sons of the great Alexius had been sometimes clouded by an opposition of interest and passion By ambition Isaac the Sebasto crator was excited to flight and rebellion from whence he was reclaimed by the firmness and clemency of John the Handsome The errors of Isaac the father of the emperors of Trebizond were short and venial but John the elder of his sons renounced for ever his religion Provoked by a real or imaginary insult of his uncle he escaped from the Roman to the Turkish camp his apostacy was re warded with the sultan s daughter the title of Chelebi or noble and the inheri tance of a princely estate and in the fifteenth century Mahomet II boasted of his imperial descent from the Comnenian family Andronicus the younger brother of John son of Isaac and grandson of Alexius Comnenus is one of the most conspi cuous characters of the age and his genuine adventures might form the subject of a very singular romance To justify the choice of three ladies of royal birth it is incumbent on me to observe that their fortunate lover was cast in the best pro portions of strength and beauty and that the want of the softer graces was supplied by a manly countenance a lofty stature athletic muscles and the air and deport ment of a soldier The preservation in his old age of health and vigour was the reward of temperance and exercise A piece of bread and a draught of water were often his sole and evening repast and if he tasted of a wild boar or a stag which he had roasted with his own hands it was the well earned fruit of a laborious chase Dexterous in arms he was ignorant of fear his persuasive eloquence could bend to every situation and character of life his style though not his practice was fashioned by the example of St Paul and in every deed of mischief he had a heart to re solve a head to contrive and a hand to execute In his youth after the death of the emperor John he followed the retreat of the Roman army but in the march through Asia Minor design or accident tempted him to wander into the mountains the hunter was encompassed by the Turkish huntsmen and he remained some time a reluctant or willing captive in the power of the sultan His virtues and vices recommended him to the favour of his cousin he shared the perils and the pleasures of Manuel and while the emperor lived in public incest with his niece Theodora the affections of her sister Eudocia were seduced and enjoyed by An dronicus Above the decencies of her sex and rank she gloried in the name of his concubine and both the palace and the camp could witness that she slept or watched in the arms of her lover She accompanied him to his military command of Cilicia the first scene of his valour and imprudence He pressed with active ardour the siege of Mopsuestia the day was employed in the boldest attacks but the night was wasted in song and dance and a band of Greek comedians formed the choicest part of his retinue Andronicus was surprised by the sally of a vigi lant foe but while his troops fled in disorder his invincible lance transpierced the thickest ranks of the Armenians On his return to the imperial camp in Mace donia he was received by Manuel with public smiles and a private reproof but the duchies of Naissus Braniscba and Castoria were the reward or consolation 01 OF THE ROMAN EMP1RE 265 the unsuccessful general Eudocia still attended his motions at midnight their tent was suddenly attacked by her angry brothers impatient to expiate her infamy in his blood his daring spirit refused her advice and the disguise of a female habit and boldly starting from his couch he drew his sword and cut his way through the numerous assassins It was here that he first betrayed his ingratitude and treachery he engaged in a treasonable correspondence with the king of Hungary and the German emperor approached the royal tent at a suspicious hour with a drawn sword and under the mask of a Latin soldier avowed an intention of re venge against a mortal foe and imprudently praised the fleetness of his horse as an instrument of flight and safety The monarch dissembled his suspicions but after the close of the campaign Andronicus was arrested and strictly confined in a tower of the palace of Constantinople  In this prison he was left above twelve years a most painful restraint from which the thirst of action and pleasure perpetually urged him to escape Ajone and pensive he perceived some broken bricks in a corner of his chamber and lie gradually widened the passage till he had explored a dark and forgotten recess Into this hole he conveyed himself and the remains of his provisions replacing the bricks in their former positions and erasing with care the footsteps of his re treat At the hour of the customary visit his guards were amazed with the silence and solitude of the prison and reported with shame and fear his incomprehensi ble flight The gates of the palace and city were instantly shut the strictest or ders were despatched into the provinces for the recovery of their fugitive and his wife on the suspicion of a pious act was basely imprisoned in the same tower At the dead of night she beheld a spectre she recognised her husband they shared their provisions and a son was the fruit of these stolen interviews which alleviated the tediousness of their confinement In the custody of a woman the vigilance of the keepers was insensibly relaxed and the captive had accomplished his real escape when he was discovered brought back to Constantinople and loaded with a double chain At length he found the moment and the means of his deliverance A boy his domestic servant intoxicated the guards and obtained in wax the impression of the keys By the diligence of his friends a similar key with a bundle of ropes was introduced nt0 he prison in the bottom of a hogshead Andronicus employed with industry and courage the instrument of his safety un locked the doors descended from the tower concealed himself all day among the bushes and scaled in the night the garden wall of the palace A boat was sta tioned for his reception he visited his own houseÂ embraced his children cast away his chain mounted a fleet horse and directed his rapid course towards the banks of the Danube At Anchialus in Thrace an intrepid friend supplied him with horses and money he traversed with speed the desert of Moldavia and the Carpathian hills and had almost reached the town of Haliez in the Polish Russia when he was intercepted by a party of Walachians who resolved to convey their important captive to Constantinople His presence of mind again extricated him from this danger Under the pretence of sickness he dismounted in the night and was allowed to step aside from the troop he planted in the ground his long staff clothed it with his cap and upper garment and stealing into the wood left a phantom to amuse for some time the eyes of the Walachians From Haliez he was honourably conducted to Kiow the residence of the great duke the subtle Greek soon obtained the esteem and confidence of Ieroslaus his character could assume the manners of every climate and the barbarians applauded his strength and cou rage in the chase of the elks and bears of the forest In this northern region he deserved the forgiveness of Manuel who solicited the Russian prince to join his arms in the invasion of Hungary The influence of Andronicus achieved this im portant service his private treaty was signed with a promise of fidelity on one side and of oblivion on the other and he marched at the head of the Russian cavalry from the Borysthenes to the Danube In his resentment Manuel had ever sympathized with the martial and dissolute character of his cousin and his free pardon was sealed in the assault of Zemlin in which he was second and se cond only to the valour of the emperor Ho sooner was the exile restored to freedom and his country than his ambition revived at first to his own and at length to the public misfortune A daughter of Manuel was a feeble bar to the succession of the more deserving males of the Com nenian blood her future marriage with the prince of Hungary was repugnant to the hopes or prejudices of the princes and nobles But when an oath of allegiance Vas required to the presumptive heir Andronicus alone asserted the honour of the Vol in 34 266 THE BECLINE AND PAIX I Roman name declined the unlawful engagement and boldly protested against the adoption of a stranger His patriotism was offensive to the emperor but he spoke the sentiments of the people and was removed from the royal presence by an ho nourable banishment a second command of the Cilician frontier with the absolute disposal of the revenues of Cyprus In this station the Armenians again exer cised his courage and exposed his negligence and the same rebel who baffled all his operations was unhorsed and almost slain by the vigour of his lance But Andronicus soon discovered a more easy and pleasing conquest the beautiful Phi lippa sister to the empress Maria and daughter of Raymond of Poitou the La tin prince of Antioch For her sake he deserted his station and wasted the sum mer in balls and tournaments to his love she sacrificed her innocence her repu tation and the offer of an advantageous marriage But the resentment of Ma nuel for this domestic affront interrupted his pleasures Andronicus left the indis creet princess to weep and to repent and with a band of desperate adventurers undertook the pilgrimage of Jerusalem His birth his martial renown and pro fessions of zeal announced him as the champion of the cross he soon captivated both the clergy and the king and the Greek prince was invested with the lord ship of Berytus on the coast of Phoenicia In his neighbourhood resided a young and handsome queen of his own nation and family great grand daughter of the emperor Alexis and widow of Baldwin III king of Jerusalem She visited and loved her kinsman Theodora was the third victim of his amorous seduction and her shame was more public and scandalous than that of her predecessors The emperor still thirsted for revenge and his subjects and allies of the Syrian frontier were repeatedly pressed to seize the person and put out the eyes of the fugitive In Palestine he was no longer safe but the tender Theodora revealed his danger and accompanied his flight The queen of Jerusalem was exposed to the east his obsequious concubine and two illegitimate children were the living monuments of her weakness Damascus was his first refuge and in the characters of the great Noureddin and his servant Saladin the superstitious Greek might learn to revere the virtues of the Mussulmans As the friend of Noureddin he visited most probably Bagdad and the courts of Persia and after a long circuit round the Caspian sea and the mountains of Georgia he finally settled among the Turks of Asia Minor the hereditary enemies of his country The sultan of Colonia af forded a hospitable retreat to Andronicus his mistress and his band of outlaws the debt of gratitude was paid by frequent inroads in the Roman province of Tre bizond and he seldom returned without an ample harvest of spoil and of Chris tian captives In the stoiy of his adventures he was fond of comparing himself to David who escaped by a long exile the snares of the wicked But the royal prophet he presumed to add was content to lurk on the borders of Judaea to slay an Amalekite and to threaten in his miserable state the life of the avaricious Nabal The excursions of the Comnenian prince had a wider range and he had spread over the eastern world the glory of his name and religion By a sentence of the Greek church the licentious rover had been separated from the faithful but even this excommunication may prove that he never abjured the profession of Christianity His vigilance had eluded or repelled the open and secret persecution of the em peror but he was at length ensnared by the captivity of his female companion The governor of Trebizond succeeded in his attempt to surprise the person of Theodora the queen of Jerusalem and her two children were sent to Constanti nople and their loss imbittered the tedious solitude of banishment The fugitive implored and obtained a final pardon with leave to throw himself at the feet of his sovereign who was satisfied with the submission of this haughty spirit Pros trate on the ground he deplored with tears and groans the guilt of his past rebel lion nor would he presume to arise unless some faithful subject would drag him to the foot of the throne by an iron chain with which he had secretly encircled his neck This extraordinary penance excited the wonder and pity of the assem bly his sins were forgiven by the church and state but the just suspicion of Ma nuel fixed his residence at a distance from the court at Oenoe a town of Pontus surrounded with rich vineyards and situate on the coast of the Euxine The death of Manuel and the disorders of the minority soon opened the fairest field for his ambition The emperor was a boy of twelve or fourteen years of age without vigour or wisdom or experience his mother the empress Mary aban doned her person and government to a favourite of the Comnenian name and his Sister another Mary whose husband an Italian was decorated with the title of OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 267 Ciesar excited a conspiracy and at length an insurrection against her odious step mother The provinces were forgotten the capital was in flames and a century of peace and order was overthrown in the vice and weakness of a few months A civil war was kindled in Constantinople the two factions fought a bloody battle in the square of the palace and the rebels sustained a regular siege in the cathedral of St Sophia The patriarch laboured with honest zeal to heal the wounds of the republic the most respectable patriots called aloud for a guardian and avenger and every tongue repeated the praise of the talents and even the virtues of An dronicus In his retirement he affected to revolve the solemn duties of his oath  If the safety or honour of the imperial family be threatened I will reveal or op pose the mischief to the utmost in my power His correspondence with the pa triarch and patricians was seasoned with apt quotations from the Psalms of David and the epistles of St Paul and he patiently waited till he was called to her deli verance by the voice of his country In his march from Oenoe to Constantinople his slender train insensibly swelled to a crowd and an army his professions of re ligion and loyalty were mistaken for the language of his heart and the simplicity of a foreign dress which showed to advantage his majestic stature displayed a lively image of his poverty and exile All opposition sunk before him he reached  the straits of the Thracian Bosphorus the Byzantine navy sailed from the harbour to receive and transport the saviour of the empire the torrent was loud and irre sistible and the insects who basked in the sunshine of royal favour disappeared at the blast of the storm It was the first care of Andronicus to occupy the pa lace to salute the emperor to confine his mother to punish her minister and to restore the public order and tranquillity He then visited the sepulchre of Ma nuel the spectators were ordered to stand aloof but as he bowed in the attitude of prayer they heard or thought they heard a murmur of triumph and revenge M I no longer fear thee my old enemy who hast driven me a vagabond to every climate of the earth Thou art safely deposited under a sevenfold dome from â whence thou canst never arise till the signal of the last trumpet It is now my turn and speedily will I trample on thy ashes and thy posterity From his subsequent tyranny we may impute such feelings to the man and the moment But it is not extremely probable that he gave an articulate sound to his secret thoughts In the first months of his administration his designs were veiled by a fair semblance of hypocrisy which could delude only the eyes of the multi tude the coronation of Alexius was performed with due solemnity and his perfi dious guardian holding in his hands the body and blood of Christ most fervently declared that he lived and was ready to die for the service of his beloved pupil But his numerous adherents were instructed to maintain that the sinking empire must perish in the hands of a child that the Romans could only be saved by a ve teran prince bold in arms skilful in policy and taught to reign by the long expe rience of fortune and mankind and that it was the duty of every citizen to force the reluctant modesty of Andronicus to undertake the burden of the public care The young emperor was himself constrained to join his voice to the general accla mation and to solicit the association of a colleague who instantly degraded him from the supreme rank secluded his person and verified the rash declaration of the patriarch that Alexius might be considered as dead so soon as he was com mitted to the custody of his guardian But his death was preceded by the impri sonment and the execution of his mother After blackening her reputation and inflaming against her the passions of the multitude the tyrant accused and tried the empress for a treasonable correspondence with the king of Hungary His own son a youth of honour and humanity avowed his abhorrence of this flagitious act and three of the judges bad the merit of preferring their conscience to their safety but the obsequious tribunal without requiring any proof or hearing any defence condemned the widow of Manuel and her unfortunate son subscribed the sentence of her death Maria was strangled her corpse was buried in the sea and her memory was wounded by the insult most offensive to female vanity a false and ugly representation of her beauteous form The fate of her son was not long de ferred he was strangled with a bow string and the tyrant insensible to pity or remorse after surveying the body of the innocent youth struck it rudely with his foot â Thv father he cried  was a knave thy mother a whore and thyself a fool The Roman sceptre the reward of his crimes was held by Andronicus about three years and a half as the guardian or sovereign of the empire His government exhibited a singular contrast of vice and virtue When he listened to his jjaB THE DECLINE AND FALL sions he was the scourge when he consulted his reason the father of his people In the exercise of private justice he was equitable and rigorous a shameful and pernicious venality was abolished and the offices were filled with the most de serving candidates by a prince who had sense to choose and severity to punish He prohibited the inhuman practice of pillaging the goods and persons of ship wrecked mariners the provinces so long the objects of oppression or neglect re vived in prosperity and plenty and millions applauded the distant blessings of his reign while he was cursed by the witnesses of his daily cruelties The ancient Eroverb that blood thirsty is the man who returns from banishment to power ad been applied with too much truth to Marius and Tiberius and was now veri fied for the third time in the life of Andronicus His memory was stored with a black list of the enemies and rivals who had traduced his merit opposed his greatness or insulted his misfortunes and the only comfort of his exile was the sacred hope and promise of revenge The necessary extinction of the young em peror and his mother imposed the fatal obligation of extirpating the friends who hated and might punish the assassin and the repetition of murder rendered him less willing and less able to forgive A horrid narrative of the victims whom he sacrificed by poison or the sword by the sea or the flames would be less expres sive of his cruelty than the appellation of the Halcyon days which was applied to a rare and bloodless week of repose the tyrant strove to transfer on the laws and the judges some portion of his guilt but the mask was fallen and his subjects could no longer mistake the true author of their calamities The noblest ot the Greeks more especially those who by descent or alliance might dispute the Comnenian inheritance escaped from the monster s den Nice or Prussa Sicily or Cyprus were their places of refuge and as their flight was already criminal they aggravated their offence by an open

essalonica and the distance of Cyprus was not more propitious to the rebel than to the tyrant His throne was subverted by a rival without merit and a peo ple without arms Isaac Angelus a descendant in the female line from the great Alexis was marked as a victim by the prudence or superstition of the emperor In a moment of despair Angelus defended his life and liberty slew the execu tioner and fled to the church of St Sophia The sanctuary was insensibly filled with a curious and mournful crowd who in his fate prognosticated their own But their lamentations were soon turned to curses and their curses to threats they dared to ask  Why do we fear  why do we obey  we are many and he is one our patience is the only bond of our slavery With the dawn of day the city burst into a general sedition the prisons were thrown open the coldest and most servile were roused to the defence of their country and Isaac the second of the name was raised from the sanctuary to the throne Unconscious of his danger the tyrant was absent withdrawn from the toils of state in the delicious islands of the Propontis He had contracted an indecent marriage with Alice or Agnes daughter of Lewis VII of France and relict of the unfortunate Alexius and his society more suitable to his temper than to his age was composed of a young wife and a favourite concubine On the first alarm he rushed to Constantinople im patient for the blood of the guilty but he was astonished by the silence of the pa lace the tumult of the city and the general desertion of mankind Andronicus proclaimed a free pardon to his subjects they neither desired nor would grant for giveness he offered to resign his crown to his son Manuel but the virtues of the son could not e5cpiate his fathers crimes The sea was still open for his retreat but the news of the revolution had flown along the coast when fear had ceased obedience was no more the imperial galley was pursued and taken by an armed brigantine and the tyrant was dragged to the presence of Isaac Angelus loaded with fetters and a long chain round his neck His eloquence and the tears of his female companions pleaded in vain for his life but instead of the decencies of a legal execution the new monarch abandoned the criminal to the numerous suf ferers whom he had deprived of a father a husband or a friend His teeth and hair an eye and a hand were torn from him as a poor compensation for their loss and a short respite was allowed that he might feel the bitterness of death Astride on a camel without any danger of rescue he was carried through the city and the basest of the populace rejoiced to trample on the fallen majesty of their prince After a thousand blows and outrages Andronicus was hung by the feet between two pillars that supported the statues of a wolf and sow and every OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 269 liand that Could reach the public enemy inflicted on his body some mark of in genious or brutal cruelty till two friendly Italians plunging their swords into his body released him from all human punishment In this long and painful agony â Lord have mercy on me and  why willyou bruise a broken reed were the only words that escaped from his mouth Our hatred for the tyrant is lost in pity for the man nor can we blame his pusillanimous resignation since a Greek Christian was no longer master of his life I have been tempted to expatiate on the extraordinary character and adventures of Andronicus but I shall here terminate the series of the Greek emperors since the time of Heraclius The branches that sprang from the Comnenian trunk had insensibly withered and the male line was continued only in the posterity of An dronicus himself who in the public confusion usurped the sovereignty of Trebi zond so obscure in history and so famous in romance A private citizen of Phi ladelphia Constantine Angelus had emerged to wealth and honours by his mar riage with a daughter of the emperor Alexius His son Andronicus is conspicuous only by his cowardice His grandson Isaac punished and succeeded the tyrant but he was dethroned by his own vices and the ambition of his brother and the discord introduced the Latins to the conquest of Constantinople the first great pe riod in the fall of the eastern empire If we compute the number and duration of the reigns it will be found that a period of six hundred years is filled by sixty emperors including in the Augustan list some female sovereigns and deducting some usurpers who were never ac knowledged in the capital and some princes who did not live to possess their in heritance The average proportion will allow ten years for each emperor far be low the chronological rule of Sir Isaac Newton who from the experience of more recent and regular monarchies has defined about eighteen or twenty years as the ter m of an ordinary reign The Byzantine empire was most tranquil and pros perous when it could acquiesce in hereditary succession five dynasties the Hera clian Isaurian Amorian Basilian and Comnenian families enjoyed and trans mitted the royal patrimony during their respective series of five four three six and four generations several princes number the years of their reign with those of their infancy and Constantine VII and his two grandsons occupy the space of an entire century But in the intervals of the Byzantine dynasties the succession is rapid and broken and the name of a successful candidate is speedily erased by a more fortunate competitor Many were the paths that led to the summit of roy alty the fabric of rebellion was overthrown by the stroke of conspiracy or un dermined by the silent arts of intrigue the favourite of the soldiers or people of the senate or clergy of the women and eunuchs were alternately clothed with the purple the means of their elevation were base and their end was often con temptible or tragic A being of the nature of man endowed with the same fa culties with a longer measure of existence would cast down a smile of pity and contempt on the crimes and follies of human ambition so eager in a narrow span to grasp at a precarious and short lived enjoyment It is thus that the experience of history exalts and enlarges the horizon of our intellectual view In a compo sition of some days in a perusal of some hours six hundred years have rolled away and the duration of a life or reign is contracted to a fleeting moment the grave is ever beside the throne the success of a criminal is almost instantly fol lowed by the loss of his prize and our immortal reason survives and disdains the sixty phantoms of kings who have passed before our eyes and faintly dwell on our remembrance The observation that in every age and climate ambition has prevailed with the same commanding energy may abate the surprise of a philo sopher but while he condemned the vanity he may search the motive of this uni versal desire to obtain and hold the sceptre of dominion To the greater part of the Byzantine series we cannot reasonably ascribe the love of fame and mankind The virtue alone of John Comnenus was beneficent and pure the most illustri ous of the princes who precede or follow that respectable name have trod with some dexterity and vigour the crooked and bloody paths of a selfish policy in scrutinizing the imperfect characters of Leo the Isaurian Basil I and Alexius Comnenus of Theophilus the second Basil and Manuel Comnenus our esteem and censure are almost equally balanced and the remainder of the imperial crowd could only desire and expect to be forgotten by posterity Was personal happi ness the aim

Charlemagne â Restoration and decay of the Roman em pire in the west â Independence of Italy â Constitution of the Germanic body In the connexion of the church and state I have considered the former

predestination and grace and the strange transformations of the eucharist from the sign to the substance of Christ s body fl I have purposely abandoned to the curiosity of the speculative divines But I nave reviewed with diligence and pleasure the objects of ecclesiastical history by which the decline and fall of the Roman empire were materially affected the propagation of Chris tianity the constitution of the catholic church the ruin of paganism and the sects that arose from the mysterious controversies concerning the Trinity and incarna tion At the head of this class we may justly rank the worship of images so fiercely disputed in the eighth and ninth centuries since a question of popular su perstition produced the revolt of Italy the temporal power of the popes and the restoration of the Roman empire in the west The primitive Christians were possessed with an unconquerable repugnance to the use and abuse of images and this aversion may be ascribed to their descent from the Jews and their enmity to the Greeks The Mosaic law had severely proscribed all representations of the Deity and that precept was firmly established in the principles and practice of the chosen people The wit of the Christian apo logists was pointed against the foolish idolaters who bowed before the workman ship of their own hands the images of brass and marble which had they been en dowed with sense and motion should have started rather from the pedestal to adore the creative powers of the artist 2 Perhaps some recent and imperfect converts of the Gnostic tribe might crown the statues of Christ and St Paul with the profane honours which they paid to those of Aristotle and Pythagoras 3 but the public religion of the catholics was uniformly simple and spiritual and the first notice of the use of pictures is in the censure of the council of Illiberis three hundred years after the Christian era Under the successors of Constantine in the peace and luxury of the triumphant church the more prudent bishops condescended to indulge a visible superstition for the benefit of the multitude and after the ruin of paganism they were no ionger restrained by the apprehension of an odious parallel

fa vours which in the popular belief were showered round their tomb conveyed an unquestionable sanction of the devout pilgrims who visited and touched and kissed these lifeless remains the memorials of their merits and sufferings 1 But a memorial more interesting than the skull or the scandals of a departed worthy is a faithful copy of his person and features delineated by the arts of painting or sculpture In every age such copies so congenial to human feelings have been cherished by the zeal of private Iriendship or public esteem the images of the Roman emperors were adored with civil and almost religious honours a reverence less ostentatious but more sincere was applied to the statues of sages and patriots and these profane virtues these splendid sins disappeared in the presence of the holy men who had died for their celestial and everlasting country At first the experiment was made with caution and scruple and the venerable pictures were discreetly allowed to instruct the ignorant to awaken the cold and to gratify the prejudices of the heathen proselytes By a slow though inevitable progression the honours of the original were transferred to the copy the devout Christian prayed before the image of a saint and the pagan rites of genuflexion luminaries and incense again stole into the catholic church The scruples of reason or piety were silenced by the strong evidence of visions and miracles and the pictures which speak and move and bleed must be endowed with a divine energy and may be considered as the proper objects of religious adoration The most audacious pencil might tremble in the rash attempt of defining by forms and colours the infinite Spi rit of the eternal Father who pervades and sustains the universe 2 But the super stitious mind was more easily reconciled to paint and to worship the angels and above all the Son of God under the human shape which on earth they have con descended to assume The second person of the Trinity had been clothed with a real and mortal body but that body had ascended into heaven and had not some si militude been presented to the eyes of his disciples the spiritual worship of Christ might have been obliterated by the visible relics and representations of the saints A similar indulgence was requisite and propitious for the Virgin Mary the place of her burial was unknown and the assumption of her soul and body into heaven was adopted by the credulity of the Greeks and Latins The use and even the wor ship of images was firmly established before the end of the sixth century they were fondly cherished by the warm imagination of the Greeks and Asiatics the Pantheon and Vatican were adorned with the emblems of a new superstition but this semblance of idolatry was more coldly entertained by the rude barbarians and the Arian clergy of the west The bolder forms of sculpture in brass or marble which peopled the temples of antiquity were offensive to the fancy or conscience of the Christian Greeks and a smooth surface of colours has ever been esteemed a more decent and harmless mode of imitation S The merit and effect of a copy depend on its resemblance with the original but the primitive Christians were ignorant of the genuine features of the Son of God his mother and his apostles the statue of Christ at Paneas in Palestine 4 was more probably that of some temporal saviour the Gnostics and their profane monuments were reprobated and the fancy of the Christian artists could only be guided by the clandestine imitation of some heathen model In this distress a bold and dexterous invention assured at once the likeness of the image and the innocence of the wor ship A new superstructure of fable was raised on the popular basis of a Syrian legend on the correspondence

records the epistle 2 but he most strangely forgets the picture of Christ 3 the perfect impression of his face on a linen with which he gratified the faith of the royal stranger who had invoked his healing power and offered the strong city of Edessa to protect him against the malice of the Jews The ignorance of the primitive church is explained by the long imprisonment of the image in a niche of the wall from whence after an oblivion of five hundred years it was re leased by some prudent bishop and seasonably presented to the devotion of the times Its first and most glorious exploit was the deliverance of the city from the arms of Chosroes Nushirvan and it was soon revered as a pledge of the divine promise that Edessa should never be taken by a foreign enemy It is true in deed that the text of Procopius ascribes the double deliverance of Edessa to the wealth and valour of her citizens who purchased the absence and repelled the assaults of the Persian monarch He was ignorant the profane historian of the testimony which he is compelled to deliver in the ecclesiastical page of Evagrius that the Palladium was exposed on the rampart and that the water which had been sprinkled on the holy face instead of quenching added new fuel to the flames of the besieged After this important service the image of Edessa was preserved with respect and gratitude and if the Armenians rejected the legend the more credulous Greeks adored the similitude which was not the work of any mortal pencil but the immediate creation of the divine original Thestyle and sentiments of a Byzantine hymn will declare how far their worship was removed from the grossest idolatry  How can we with mortal eyes contemplate this image whose celestial splendour the host of heaven presumes not to behold He who dwells in heaven condescends this day to visit us by his venerable image He who is seated on the cherubim visits us this day by a picture which the Father has delineated with his immaculate hand which he has formed in an ineffable manner and which we sanctify by adoring it with fear and love Before the end of the sixth century these images made without hands in Greek it is a single word 4 were propa gated in the camps and cities of the eastern empire 5 they were the objects of worship and the instruments of miracles and in the hour of danger or tumult their venerable presence could revive the hope rekindle the courage or repress the fury of the Roman legions Of these pictures the far greater part the tran scripts of a human pencil could only pretend to a secondary likeness and improper title but there were some of higher descent who derived their resemblance from an immediate contact with the original endowed for that purpose with a mira culous and prolific virtue The most ambitious aspired from a filial to a fraternal relation with the image of Edessa and such is the veronica of Rome or Spain or Jerusalem which Christ in his agony and bloody sweat applied to his face and delivered to a holy matron The fruitful precedent was speedily transferred to the Virgin Mary and the saints and martyrs In the church of Diospolis in Pa lestine the features of the mother of God 6

painter so profane and odious in the eyes of the primitive Christians The Olympian Jove created by the muse of Homer and the chisel of Phidias might inspire a philosophic mind with momentary devotion but these catholic images were faintly and flatly delineated by monkish artists in the last degeneracy of taste and genius 1 The worship of images has stolen into the church by insensible degrees and each petty step was pleasing to the superstitious mind as productive of comfort and innocent of sin But in the beginning of the eighth century in the full magni tude of the abuse the more timorous Greeks were awakened by an apprehension that under the mask of Christianity they had restored the religion of their fa thers they heard with grief and impatience the name of idolaters the incessant charge of the Jews and Mahometans 2 who derived from the law and the Koran an immortal hatred to graven images and all the relative worship The servitude of the Jews might curb their zeal and depreciate their authority but the trium phant Mussulmans who reigned at Damascus and threatened Constantinople cast into the scale of reproach the accumulated weight of truth and victory The cities of Syria Palestine and Egypt had been fortified by the images of Christ his mother and his saints and each city presumed on the hope or promise of miracu lous defence In a rapid conquest often years the Arabs subdued those cities and these images and in their opinion the Lord of Hosts pronounced a decisive judg ment between the adoration and contempt of these mute and inanimate idols For awhile Edessa had braved the Persian assaults but the chosen city the spouse of Christ was involved in the common ruin and his divine resemblance became the slave and trophy of the infidels After a servitude of three hundred years the pal ladium was yielded to the devotion of Constantinople for a ransom of twelve thou sand pounds of silver the redemption of two hundred Mussulmans and a perpetual truce of the territory of Edessa 3 In this season of distress and dismay the elo quence of the monks was exercised in the defence of images and they attempted to prove that the sin of schism of the greatest part of the orientals had forfeited the favour and annihilated the virtue of these precious symbols But they were now opposed by the murmurs of many simple or rational Christians who appealed to the evidence of texts of facts and of the primitive times and secretly desired the reformation of the church As the worship of images had never been establish ed by any general or positive law its progress in the eastern empire had been re tarded or accelerated by the differences of men and manners the local degrees of refinement and the personal characters of the bishops The splendid devotion was fondly cherished bv the levity of the capital and the inventive genius of the By zantine clergy while the rude and remote districts of Asia were strangers to this innovation of sacred luxury Many large congregations of Gnostics and Arians maintained after their conversion the simple worship which had preceded their separation and the Armenians the most warlike subjects of Rome were not re conciled in the twelfth century to the sight of images 4 The various denomina tions of men afforded a fund of prejudices and aversion of small account in the villages of Anatolia or Thrace but which in the fortune of a soldier a prelate or a eunuch might be often connected with the powers of the church and state Of such adventures the most fortunate was the emperor Leo 111 5 who from the mountains of Isauria ascended the throne of the east He was ignorant of sa 1 w Your scandalous figures stand quite out from the canvas they are as bad as a croupe of statues It was thus that the

of a prince to impose on his subjects the dictates of his own conscience But in the outside of an unsettled reign during ten years of toil and danger Leo submitted to the meanness of hypocrisy bowed before the idols which he despised and satisfied the Roman pontiff with the annual profes sions of his orthodoxy and zeal In the reformation of religion his first steps were moderate and cautious he assembled a great council of senators and bishops and enacted with their consent that all the images should be removed from the sanc tuary and altar to a proper height in the churches where they might be visible to the eyes and inaccessible to the superstition of the people But it was impossi ble on either side to check the rapid though adverse impulse of veneration and ab horrence in their lofty position the sacred images still edified their votaries and reproached the tyrant He was himself provoked by resistance find invective and his own party accused him of an imperfect discharge of his duty and urged for his imitation the example of the Jewish king who had broken without scruple the brazen serpent of the temple By a second edict he proscribed the existence as well as the use of religious pictures the churches of Constantinople and the pro vinces were cleansed from idolatry the images of Christ the Virgin and the saints were demolished or a smooth surface of plaster was spread over the walls of the edifice The sect of the Iconoclasts was supported by the zeal and despo tism of six emperors and the east and west were involved in a noisy conflict of one hundred and twenty years It was the design of Leo the Isaurian to pronounce the condemnation of images as an article of faith and by the authority of a gene ral council but the convocation of such an assembly was reserved for his son Con stantine l and though it is stigmatized by triumphant bigotry as a meeting of fools and atheists their own partial and mutilated acts betray many symptoms of rea son and piety The debates and decrees of many provincial synods introduced the summons of the general council which met in the suburbs of Constantinople and was composed of a respectable number of three hundred and thirty eight bishops ef Europe and Anatolia for the patriarchs of Antioch and Alexandria were the slaves of the caliph and the Roman pontiff had withdrawn the churches of Italy and the west from the communion of the Greeks This Byzantine synod assumed the rank and powers of the seventh general council yet even this title was a re cognition of the six preceding assemblies which had laboriously built the structure of the catholic faith After a serious deliberation of six months the three hun dred and thirty eight bishops pronounced and subscribed a unanimous decree that all visible symbols of Christ except in the eucharist were either blasphemous or heretical that image worship was a corruption of Christianity and a renewal of paganism that all such monuments of idolatry should be broken or erased and that those who should refuse to deliver the objects of their private superstition were guilty of disobedience to the authority of the church and of the emperor In their loud and loyal acclamations they celebrated the merits of their temporal re deemer and to his zeal and justice they intrusted the execution of their spiritual censures At Constantinople as in the former councils the will of the prince was the rule of episcopal faith but on this occasion I am inclined to suspect that a large majority of the prelates sacrificed their secret conscience to the temptations of hope and fear In the long night of superstition the Christians had wandered far away from the simplicity of the gospel nor was it easy for them to discern the clue and tread back the mazes of the labyrinth The worship of images was in separably blended at least to a pious fancy with the cross the Virgin the saints and their relics the holy ground was involved in a cloud of miracles and visions and the nerves of the mind curiosity and scepticism were benumbed by the ha bits of obedience and belief Constantine himself is accused of indulging a royal license to doubt to

were massacred and the popular enthusiasm was quelled by the strongest efforts of the civil and military power Of the Archipelago or holy see the numerous islands were filled with images and monks their votaries abjured without scruple the enemy of Christ his mo ther and the saints they armed a fleet of boats and galleys displayed their con secrated banners and boldly steered for the harbour of

clamour sedition conspiracy and mutual hatred and sanguinary revenge the persecution of images was the motive or pretence of his adversa ries and if they missed a temporal diadem they were rewarded by

wanton or malicious havoc was exer cised against the relics and even the books of the monasteries With the habit and profession of monks the public and private worship of images was rigorously proscribed and it should seem that a solemn abjuration of idolatry was exacted from the subjects or at least from the clergy of the eastern empire l The patient east abjured with reluctance her sacred images they were fondly cherished and vigorously defended by the independent zeal of the Italians In ecclesiastical rank and jurisdiction the patriarch of Constantinople and the pope of Rome were nearly equal But the Greek prelate was a domestic slave under the eye of his master at whose nod he alternately passed from the convent to the throne and from the throne to the convent A distant and dangerous station amidst the barbarians of the west excited the spirit and freedom of the Latin bi shops Their popular election endeared them to the Romans the public and pri vate indigence was relieved by their ample revenue and the weakness or neglect of the emperors compelled them to consult both in peace and war the temporal safety of the city In the school of adversity the priest insensibly imbibed the virtues and the ambition of a prince the same character was assumed the same policy was adopted by the Italian the Greek or the Syrian who ascended the chair of St Peter and after the loss of her legions and provinces the genius and fortune of the popes again restored the supremacy of Rome It is agreed that in the eighth century their dominion was founded on rebellion and that the rebellion was produced and justified by the heresy of the Iconoclasts but the conduct of the second and third Gregory in this memorable contest is variously interpreted by the wishes of their friends and enemies The Byzantine writers unanimously declare that after a fruitless admonition they pronounced the separation of the east and west and deprived the sacrilegious tyrant of the revenue and sovereignty of Italy Their excommunication is still more clearly expressed by the Greeks who beheld the accomplishment of the papal triumphs and as they are more strongly attached to their religion than to their country they praise instead of blaming the zeal and orthodoxy of these apostolical men 2 The modern cham pions of Rome are eager to accept the praise and the precedent this great and glorious example of the disposition of royal heretics is celebrated by the cardinals Baronius and Bellarmine 3 and if they are asked why the same thunders were not hurled against the Neros and Julians of antiquity they reply that the weak ness of the primitive church was the sole cause of her patient loyalty 4 On this occasion the effects of love and hatred are the same and the zealous protestants  who seek to kindle the indignation and to alarm the fears of princes and magis trates expatiate on the insolence and treason of the two Gregories against their lawful sovereign 5 They are defended only by the moderate catholics for the most part of the Gallican church 6 who respect the saint without approving the sin These common advocates of the crown and the mitre circumscribe the

During ten pure and fortunate years says Gregory to the emperor we have tasted the annual comforts of your royal letters subscribed in purple ink with your own hand the sacred pledges of your attachment to the orthodox creed of our fathers How deplorable is the change how tremendous the scandal You now accuse the catholics of idolatry and by the accusation you betray your own impiety and ignorance To this ignorance we are compelled to adapt the gross ness of our style and arguments the first elements of holy letters are sufficient for yourconfusion and were you to enter a grammar school and avow yourself the ene my of our worship the simple and pious children would be provoked to cast their horn books at your head After this decent salutation the pope attempts the usual distinctions between the idols of antiquity and the Christian images The former were the fanciful representations of phantoms or demons at a time when the true God had not manifested his person in any visible likeness The latter are the genuine forms of Christ his mother and his saints who had approved by a crowd of miracles the innocence and merit of this relative worship He must indeed have trusted to the ignorance of Leo since he could assert the perpetual use of images from the apostolic age and their venerable presence in the six sy nods of the catholic church A more specious argument is drawn from the pre sent possession and recent practice the harmony of the Christian world supersedes the demand of a general council and Gregory frankly confesses that such assem blies can only bp useful under the reign of an orthodox prince To the impudent and inhuman Leo more guilty than a heretic he recommends peace silence and implicit obedience to his spiritual guides of Constantinople and Rome The li mits of civil and ecclesiastical powers are defined by the pontiff To the former he appropriates the body to the latter the soul the sword of justice is in the hands of the magistrate the more formidable weapon of excommunication is intrusted to the clergy and in the exercise of their divine commission a zealous son will not spare his offending father the successor of St Peter may lawfully chastise the kings of the earth  You assault us O tyrant with a carnal and military hand unarmed and naked we can only implore the Christ the prince of the heavenly host that he will send unto you a devil for the destruction of your body and the salvation of your soul You declare with foolish arrogance I will despatch my orders to Rome I will break in pieces the image of St Peter and Gregory like his predecessor Martin shall be transported in chains and in exile to the foot of the imperial throne Would to God that I might be permitted to tread in the foot steps of the holy Martin but may the fate of Constans serve as a warning to the persecutors of the church After his just condemnation by the bishops of Sicily the tyrant was cut off in the fulness of his sins by a domestic servant the saint is still adored by the nations of Scythia among whom he ended his banishment and his life But it is our duty to live for the edification and support of the faithful peo ple nor are we reduced to risk our safety on the event of a combat Incapable as you are of defending your Roman subjects the maritime situation of the city may perhaps expose it to your depredation but we can remove to the distance of four and twenty stadia 3 to the first fortress of the Lombards and then you may pursue the winds Are you ignorant that the popes are the bond of union the mediators of peace

per  sist we are innocent of the blood that will be spilt in the contest may it fall on your own head  The first assault of Leo against the images of Constantinople had been witnessed by a crowd of strangers from Italy and the west who related with grief and indig nation the sacrilege of the emperor But on the reception of his proscriptive edict they trembled for their domestic deities the images of Christ and the Virgin of the angels martyrs and saints were abolished in all the churches of Italy and a strong alternative was proposed to the Roman pontiff the royal favour as the Srice of his compliance degradation and exile as the penalty of his disobedience Neither zeal nor policy allowed him to hesitate and the haughty strain in which Gregory addressed the emperor displays his confidence in the truth of his doctrine or the powers of resistance Without depending on prayers or miracles he boldly armed against the public enemy and his pastoral letters admonished the Italians of their danger and of their duty S At this signal Ravenna Venice and the cities of the exarchate and Pentapolis adhered to the cause of religion their mili tary force by sea and land consisted for the most part of the natives and the spi rit of patriotism and zeal was transfused into the mercenary strangers The Italians swore to live and die in the defence of the pope and the holy images the Roman people was devoted to their father and even the Lombards were ambitious to share the merit and advantage of this holy war The most treasonable act but the most obvious revenge was the destruction of the statues of Leo himself the most effectual and pleasing measure of rebellion was the withholding the tribute of Italy and depriving him of a power which he had recently abused by the imposition of a new capitation 4 A form of administration was preserved by the election of magistrates and governors and so high was the public indignation that the Italians were prepared to create an orthodox emperor and to conduct him with a fleet and army to the palace of Constantinople In that palace the Roman bishops the second and third Gregory were condemned as the authors of the revolt and every attempt was made either by fraud or force to seize their persons and to strike at their lives The city was repeatedly visited or assaulted by captains of the guards and dukes and exarchs of high dignity or secret trust they landed with foreign troops they obtained some domestic aid and the superstition of Naples may blush that her fathers were attached to the cause of heresy But these clandestine or open attacks were repelled by the courage and vigilance of the Romans the Greeks were overthrown and massacred their leaders suffered an ignominious death and the popes however inclined to mercy refused to intercede for these guilty victims At Ravenna 5 the several quarters of the city had long exercised a bloody and hereditary feud in religious controversy they found a new aliment of faction but the votaries of images were superior in numbers or spirit and the exarch who attempted to stem the torrent lost his life in a popular sedition To punish this flagitious deed and restore his dominion in Italy the emperor sent a 2 Awo mis ecsrioo j Juntos tou yoptvov iis TETov p 665 The pope appears to have imposed on the T xanceof the Greeks he lived and died in the Lateran and in his

clergy in sackcloth and ashes lay prostrate in prayer the men were in arms for the de fence of their country the common danger had united the factions and the event of a battle was preferred to the slow miseries of a siege In a hard fought day as the two armies alternately yielded and advanced a phantom was seen a voice was he ard and Ravenna was victorious by the assurance of victory The strangers retreated to their ships but the populous sea coast poured forth a multitude of boats the waters of the Po were so deeply infected with blood that during six years the public prejudice abstained from the fish of the river and the institution of an annual feast perpetuated the worship of images and the abhorrence of the Greek tyrant Amidst the triumph of the catholic arms the Roman pontiff con vened a synod of ninety three bishops against the heresy of the Iconoclasts With their consent he pronounced a general excommunication against all who by word or deed should attack the tradition of the fathers and the images of the saints in this sentence the emperor was tacitly involved l but the vote of a last and hope less remonstrance may seem to imply that the anathema was yet suspended over his guilty head No sooner had they confirmed their own safety the worship of images and the freedom of Rome and Italy than the popes appear to have relaxed of their severity and to have spared the relics of the Byzantine dominion Their moderate counsels delayed and prevented the election of a new emperor and they exhorted the Italians not to separate from the body of the Roman monarchy The exarch was permitted to reside within the walls of Ravenna a captive rather than a master and till the imperial coronation of Charlemagne the government of Rome and Italy was exercised in the name of the successors of Constantine 2 The liberty of Rome which had been oppressed by the arms and arts of Au gustus was rescued after seven hundred and fifty years of servitude from the persecution of Leo the IsaUrian By the Cscsars the triumphs of the consuls had been annihilated in the decline and fall of the empire the God Terminus the sacred boundary had insensibly receded from the ocean the Rhine the Danube and the Euphrates and Rome was reduced to her ancient territory from Viterbo to Xerracina and from Narni to the mouth of the Tiber 3 When the kings were banished the republic reposed on the firm basis which had been founded by their wisdom and virtue Their perpetual jurisdiction was divided between two annual magistrates the senate continued to exercise the powers of administration and counsel and the legislative authority was distributed in the assemblies of the people by a well proportioned scale of property and service Ignorant of the arts of luxury the primitive Romans had improved the science of government and war the will of the community was absolute the rights of individuals were sacred one hundred and thirty thousand citizens were armed for defence or conquest and a band of robbers and outlaws was moulded into a nation deserv ing of freedom and ambitious of glory 4 When the sovereignty of the Greek emperors was extinguished the ruins of Rome presented the sad image of de population and decay her slavery was a habit her liberty an accident the ef fect of superstition and the object of her own amazement and terror The last vestige of the substance or even the forms of the constitution was obliterated from the practice and memory of the Romans and they were devoid of knowledge or virtue again to build the fabric of a commonwealth

tempt of a foe they called him a Roman and in this name says the bishop Liutprand  we include whatever is base whatever is cowardly whatever is per fidious the extremes of avarice and luxury and every vice that can prostitute the dignity of human nature 1 By the necessity of their situation the inhabitants of Rome were cast into the rough model of a republican government they were compelled to elect some judges in peace and some leaders in war the nobles as sembled to deliberate and their resolves could not be executed without the union and consent of the multitude The style of the Roman senate and people was re vived 2 but the spirit was fled and their new independence was disgraced by the tumultuous conflict of licentiousness and oppression The want of laws could only be supplied by the influence of religion and their foreign and domestic coun sels were moderated by the authority of the bishop His alms his sermons his correspondence with the kings and prelates of the west his recent services their gratitude an oath accustomed the Romans to consider him as the first magistrate or prince of the city The Christian humility of the popes was not offended by the name of Domimts or Lord and their face and inscription are still apparent on the most ancient coins 3 Their temporal dominion is now confirmed by the reverence of a thousand years and their noblest title is the free choice of a peo ple whom they had redeemed from slavery  W In the quarrels of ancient Greece the holy people of Ellis enjoyed a perpetual peace under the protection of Jupiter and in the exercise of the Olympic games 4 Happy would it have been for the Romans if a similar privilege had guarded the patrimony of St Peter from the calamities of war if the Christians who visited the holy threshold would have sheathed their swords in the presence of the apos tle and his successor But this mystic circle could have been traced only by the wand of a legislator and a sage this pacific system was incompatible with the zeal and ambition of the popes the Romans were not addicted like the inhabi tants of Ellis to the innocent and placid labours of agriculture and the barba rians of Italy though softened by the climate were far below the Grecian states in the institutions of public and private life A memorable example of repentance and piety was exhibited by Liutprand king of the Lombards In arms at the gate of the Vatican the conqueror listened to the voice of Gregory 11 5 with drew his troops resigned his conquests respectfully visited the church of St Pe ter and after performing his devotions offered his sword and dagger his cuirass and mantle his silver cross and his crown of gold on the tomb of the apostle But this religious fervour was the illusion perhaps the artifice of the moment the sense of interest is strong and lasting the love of arms and rapine was congenial to the Lombards and both the prince and people were irresistibly tempted bythe disorders of Italy the nakedness of Rome and the unwarlike profession of her new chief On the first edicts of the emperor they declared themselves the champions of the holy images Liutprand invaded the province of Romagna which had already assumed that distinctive appellation the catholics of the ex archate yielded without reluctance to his civil and military power and a foreign enemy was introduced for the first time into the impregnable fortress of Ravenna That city and fortress were speedily recovered by the active diligence and mari time forces of the Venetians and those faithful subjects obeyed the exhortations of Gregory himself in separating the personal guilt of Leo from the general cause of the Roman empire 6 The Greeks were less mindful of the service than the 1 Quos Romanes nos Langobardi

the two nations hostile in their faith were reconciled in a dangerous and unnatural alliance the king and the exarch marched to the con quest of Spoleto and Rome the storm evaporated without effect but the policy of Liutprand alarmed Italy with a vexatious alternative of hostility and truce His successor Astolphus declared himself the equal enemy of the emperor and the pope Ravenna was subdued by force or treachery and this final conquest extinguished the series of the exarchs who had reigned with the subordinate power since the time of Justinian and the ruin of the Gothic kingdom Rome was sum moned to acknowledge the victorious Lombard as her lawful sovereign the an nual tribute of a piece of gold was fixed as the ransom of each citizen and the sword of destruction was unsheathed to exact the penalty of her disobedience The Romans hesitated they entreated they complained and the threatening barbarians were checked by arms and negotiations till the popes had engaged the friendship of an ally and avenger beyond the Alps 2 In his distress the first Gregory had implored the aid of the hero of the age of Charles Martel who governed the French monarchy with the humble title of mayor or duke and who by his signal victory over the Saracens had saved his country and perhaps Europe from the Mahometan yoke The ambassadors of the pope were received by Charles with decent reverence but the greatness of his occupations and the shortness of his lite prevented his interference in the af fairs of Italy except by a friendly and ineffectual mediation His son Pepin the heir of his power and virtues assumed the office of champion of the Roman church and the zeal of the French prince appears to have been prompted by the love of glory and religion But the danger was on the banks of the Tiber the succour on those of the Seine and our sympathy is cold to the relation of distant misery Amidst the tears of the city Stephen III embraced the generous resolution of vi siting in person the courts of Lombardy and France to deprecate the injustice of his enemy or to excite the pity and indignation of his friend After soothing the public despair by litanies and orations he undertook this laborious journey with the ambassadors of the French monarch and the Greek emperor The king of the Lombards was inexorable but his threats could not silence the complaints nor retard the speed of the Roman pontiff who traversed the Pennine Alps re posed in the abbey of St Maurice and hastened to grasp the right hand of his pro tector a hand which was never lifted in vain either in war or friendship Ste Â phen was entertained as the visible successor of the apostle at the next assembly the field of March or of May his injuries were exposed to a devout and warlike nation and he repassed the Alps not as a suppliant but as a conqueror at the head of a French army which was led by the king in person The Lombards after a weak resistance obtained an ignominious peace and swore to restore the pos sessions and to respect the sanctity of the Roman church But no sooner was Astolphus delivered from the presence of the French arms than he forgot his pro mise and resented his disgrace Rome was again encompassed by his arms and Stephen apprehensive of fatiguing the zeal of his Transalpine allies enforced his complaint and request by an eloquent letter in the name and person of St Peter himself 3 The apostle assures his adoptive sons the king the clei gy and the nobles of France that dead in the flesh he is still alive in the spirit that they now hear and must obey the voice of the

and sincerity by tfee scourge of a foreign master After this double chastisement the Lombards lan guished about twenty years in a state of langour and decay But their minds were not yet humbled to their condition and instead of affecting the pacific virtues of the feeble they peevishly harassed the Romans with a repetition of claims eva sions and inroads which they undertook without reflection and terminated with out glory On either side their expiring monarchy was pressed by the zeal and prudence of pope Adrian I the genius the fortune and greatness of Charlemagne the son of Pepin these heroes of the church and state were united in public and domestic friendship and while they trampled on the prostrate they varnished their proceedings with the fairest colours of equity and moderation 1 The passes of the Alps and the walls of Pavia were the only defence of the Lombards the former were surprised the latter were invested by the son of Pepin and after a blockade of two years Desiderius the last of their native princes surrendered his sceptre and his capital Under the dominion of a foreign king but in the pos session of their national laws the Lombards became the brethren rather than the subjects of the Franks who derived their blood and manners and language from the same Germanic origin 2 The mutual obligations of the popes and the Carlovingian family form the im portant link of ancient and modem of civil and ecclesiastical history In the con quest of Italy the champions of the Roman church obtained a favourable occasion a specious title the wishes of the people the prayers and intrigues of the clergy But the most essential gifts of the popes to the Carlovingian race were the digni ties of the king of France 3 and of patrician of Rome I Under the sacerdotal monarchy of St Peter the nations began to resume the practice of seeking on the banks of the Tiber their kings their laws and the oracles of their fate The Franks were perplexed between the name and substance of their government All the powers of royalty were exercised by Pepin mayor of the palace and nothing except the regal title was wanting to his ambition His enemies were crushed by his valour his friends were multiplied by his liberality his father had been the sa viour of Christendom and the claims of personal merit were repeated and ennobled in a descent of four generations The name and image of royalty were still pre served in the last descendant of Clovis the feeble Childeric but his obsolete rijjrit could only be used as an instrument of sedition the nation was desirous of restoring the simplicity of the constitution and Pepin a subject and a prince was ambitious to ascertain his own rank and the fortune of his family The mayor and the no bles were bound by an oath of fidelity to the royal phantom the blood of Clovis was pure and sacred in their eyes and their common ambassadors addressed the Roman pontiff to dispel their scruples or to absolve their promise The interest of pope Zachary the successors of the two Gregories prompted him to decide and to decide in their favour he pronounced that the nation might lawfully unite in the same person the title and authority of king and that the unfortunate Childerie a victim of the public safety should be degraded shaved and confined in a mo nastery for the remainder of his days An answer so agreeable to their wishes was accepted by he Franks as the opinion of a casuist the sentence of a judge or the oracle of a prophet the Merovingian race disappeared from the earth and Pepin was exalted on a buckler by the suffrage of a free people accustomed to obey his laws and to march jnder his standard His coronation was twice performed with the sanction of thepoj s by their most faithful servant St

of Charlemagne affirms that the French sceptre was transferred by the authority of the popes l and in their boldest enterprises they insist with confidence on this signal and successful act of temporal jurisdiction II In the change of manners and language the patricians of Rome 2 were far removed from the senate of Romulus or the palace of Constantine from the free nobles of the republic or the fictitious parents of the emperor After the reco very of Italy and Africa by the arms of Justinian the importance and danger of those remote provinces required the presence of a supreme magistrate he was indifferently styled the exarch or the patrician and these governors of Ravenna who fill their places in the chronology of princes extended their jurisdiction over the Roman city Since the revolt ot Italy and the loss of the exarchate the dis tress of the Romans had exacted some sacrifice of their independence Yet even in this act they exercised the right of disposing of themselves and the decrees of the senate and people successively invested Charles Martel and his posterity with the honours of patrician of Rome The leaders of a powerful nation would have disdained a servile title and subordinate office but the reign of the Greek emperors was suspended and in the vacancy of the empire they derived a more glorious commission from the pope and the republic The Roman ambassadors presented these patricians with the keys of the shrine of St Peter as a pledge and symbol of sovereignty with a holy banner which it was their right and duty to unfurl in the detence of the church and city 3 In the time of Charles Martel and of Pepin the interposition of the Lombard kingdom covered the free dom while it threatened the safety of Rome and the patriciate represented only the title the service the alliance of these distant protectors The power and policy of Charlemagne annihilated an enemy and imposed a master In his first visit to the capital he was received with all the honours which had formerly been paid to the exarch the representative of the emperor and these honours obtained some new decorations from the joy and gratitude of Pope Hadrian I 4 No sooner was he informed of the sudden approach of the monarch than he despatched the magistrates and nobles of Rome to meet him with the banner about thirty miles from the city At the distance of one mile the Flaminian way was lined with the schools or national communities of Greeks Lombards Saxons c the Roman youth were under arms and the children of a more tender age with palms and olive branches in their hands chanted the praises of their great deliverer At the aspect of the holy crosses and ensigns of the saints he dismounted from his horse led the procession of his nobles to the Vatican and as he ascended the stairs de voutly kissed each step of the threshold of the apostles In the portico Hadrian expected him at the head of his clergy they embraced as friends and equals but in their march to the altar the king or patrician assumed the right hand of the pope Nor was the Frank content with these vain and empty demonstrations of respect In the twenty six years that elapsed between the conquest of Lombar

his person and family in his name money was coined and justice was administered and the election of the popes was examined and confirmed by his au thority Except an original and self inherent claim of sovereignty there was not any prerogative remaining which the title of emperor could add to the patrician of Rome l The gratitude of the Carlovingians was adequate to these obligations and their names are consecrated as the saviours and benefactors of the Roman church Her ancient patrimony of farms and houses was transformed by their bounty into the temporal dominion of cities and provinces and the donation of the exarchate was the first fruits of the conquest of Pepin 2 Astolphus with a sigh relinquished his prey the keys and the hostages of the principal cities were delivered to the French ambassador and in his master s name he presented them before the tomb of St Peter The ample measure of the exarchate S might comprise all the provinces of Italy which had obeyed the emperor and his vicegerent but its strict and proper limits were included in the territories of Ravenna Bologna and Ferrara its inseparable dependency was the Pentapolis which stretched along the Hadriatic from Rimini to Ancona and advanced into the midland country as far as the ridges of the Appennine In this transaction the ambition and avarice of the  popes had been severely condemned Perhaps the humility of a Christian priest should have rejected an earthly kingdom which it was not easy for him to govern without renouncing the virtues of his profession Perhaps a faithful subject or a generous enemy would have been less impatient to divide the spoils of the bar barian and if the emperor had intrusted Stephen to solicit in his name the resti tution of the exarchate I will not absolve the pope from the reproach of treachery and falsehood But in the rigid interpretation of the laws every one may accept without injury whatever his benefactor can bestow without injustice The Greek emperor had abdicated or forfeited his right to the exarchate and the sword of Astolphus was broken by the stronger sword of the Carlovingian It was not in the cause of the Iconoclast that Pepin had exposed his person and army in a double expedition beyond the Alps he possessed and might lawfully alienate his con quests and to the importunities of the Greeks he piously replied that no human consideration should tempt him to resume the gift which he had conferred on the Roman pontiff for the remission of his sins and the salvation of his soul The splendid donation was granted in supreme and absolute dominion and the world beheld for the first time a Christian bishop invested with the prerogatives of a tempo ral prince the choice of magistrates the exercise of justice the imposition of taxes and the wealth of the palace of Ravenna In the dissolution of the Lombard king dom the inhabitants of the duchy of Spoleto 4 sought a refuge from the storm shaved their heads after the Roman fashion declared themselves the servants and subjects of St Peter and completed by this voluntary surrender the pre sent circle of the ecclesiastical state That mysterious circle was enlarged to an indefinite extent by the verbal or written donation of Charlemagne 5 who in the first transports of his Victory despoiled himself and the Greek emperor of the cities and islands which had formerly been annexed to the ex archate But in the cooler moments of absence and reflection he viewed with an eye of jealousy and envy the recent greatness of his ecclesiastical ally The execution of his own and his father

as well as Rome was numbered in the ist of his metropolitan cities The sovereignty of the exarchate melted away In the hands of the popes they found in the archbishops of Ravenna a dangerous and domestic rival 2 the nobles and people disdained the yoke of a priest and in the disorders of the times they could only retain the memory of an ancient claim which in a more prosperous age they have revived and realized Fraud is the resource of weakness and cunning and the strong though ignorant barbarian was often entangled in the net of sacerdotal policy The Vatican and Lateran were an arsenal and manufacture which according to the occasion have produced or concealed a various collection of false or genuine of corrupt or suspi cious acts as they tended to promote the interest of the Roman church Before the end of the eighth century some apostolical scribe perhaps the notorious Isi dore composed the decretals and the donation of Constantine the two magic pil lars of ihe spiritual and temporal monarchy of the popes This memorable dona tion was introduced to the world by an epistle of Hadrian I who exhorts Charle magne to imitate the liberality and revive the name of the great Constantine 3 According to the legend the first of the Christian emperors was healed of the le prosy and purified in the waters of baptism by St Silvester the Roman bishop and never was physician more gloriously recompensed His royal proselyte with drew from his seat and patrimony of St Peter declared his resolution of founding a new capital in the east and resigned to the popes the free and perpetual sove reignty of Rome Italy and the provinces of the west 4 This fiction was pro ductive of the most beneficial effects The Greek princes were convicted of the guilt of usurpation and the revolt of Gregory was the claim of his lawful inheri tance The popes were delivered from their debt of gratitude and the nominal gifts of the Carlovingians were no more than the just and irrevocable restitution of a scanty portion of the ecclesiastical state The sovereignty of Rome no longer depended on the choice of a fickle people and the successors of St Peter and Con stantine were invested with the purple and prerogatives of the C sars So deep was the ignorance and credulity of the times that the most absurd of fables was received with equal reverence in Greece and in France and is still enrolled among the decrees of the canon law 5 The emperors and the Romans were incapable of discerning a forgery that subverted their rights and freedom and the only opposition proceeded from a Sabine monastery which in the beginning of the twelfth century disputed the truth and validity of the donation of Constan tine 6 In the revival of letters and liberty this fictitious deed was transpierced by the pen of Laurentius Valla the pen of an eloquent critic and a Roman patriot 7 His cotemporaries of the fifteenth century were astonished at his sacrilegious bold ness yet such is the

fortune which has attended the decretals and the Sibylline oracles the edifice has subsist ed after the foundations have been undermined While the popes established in Italy their freedom and dominion the images the first cause of their revolt were restored in the eastern empire 5 Under the reign of Constantine V the union of civil and ecclesiastical power had overthrown the tree without extirpating the root of superstition The idols for such they were now held were secretly cherished by the order and the sex most prone to devo tion and the fond alliance of the monks and females obtained a final victory over the reason and authority of man Leo IV maintained with less rigour the religion of his father and grandfather but his wife the fair and ambitious Irene had im bibed the zeal of the Athenians the heirs of the idolatry rather than the philoso phy of their ancestors During the life of her husband these sentiments were inflamed by danger and dissimulation and she could only labour to protect and promote some favourite monks whom she drew from their caverns and seated on the metropolitan thrones of the east But as soon as she reigned in her own name and that of her son Irene more seriously undertook the ruin of the Iconoclasts and the first step of her future persecution was a general edict for liberty of conscience In the restoration of the monks a thousand images were exposed te the public ve neration a thousand legends were invented of their sufferings and miracles By the opportunities of death or removal the episcopal seats were judiciously filled the most eager competitors for earthly or celestial favour anticipated and flattered the judgment of their sovereign and the promotion of her secretary Tarasius gave Irene the patriarch of Constantinople and the command of the oriental church But the decrees of a general council could only be repealed by a similar assem bly the Iconoclasts whom she convened were bold in possession and averse to debate and the feeble voice of the bishops was re echoed by the more formidable clamour of the soldiers and people of Constantinople The delay and intrigues of a year the separation of the disaffected troops and the choice of Nice for a second orthodox synod removed these obstacles and the episcopal conscience was again after the Greek fashion in the hands of the prince No more than eighteen days were allowed for the consummation of this important work the Iconoclasts ap peared not as judges but as criminals or penitents the scene was decorated by the legates of pope Hadrian and the eastern

of Christ be entitled to the same mode of adoration Of this second Nicene council the acts are still extant a curious monument of super stition and ignorance of falsehood and folly I shall only notice the judgment of the bishops on the comparative merit of image worship and morality A monk had concluded a truce with the demon of fornication on condition of interrupting his daily prayes to a picture that hung in his cell His scruples prompted him to con sult the abbot  Rather than abstain from adoring Christ and his mother in their holy images it would be better replied the casuist to enter every brothel and visit every prostitute in the city l For the honour of orthodoxy at least the orthodoxy of the Roman church it is somewhat unfortunate that the two princes who convened the two councils of Nice are both stained with the blood of their sons The second of these assemblies was approved and rigorously executed by the despotism of Irene and she refused her adversaries the toleration which at first she had granted to her friends During the five succeeding reigns a period of thirty eight years the contest was main tained with unabated rage and various success between the worshippers and the breakers of the images but I am not inclined to pursue with minute diligence the repetition of the same events Nicephorus allowed a general liberty of speech and practice and the only virtue of his reign is accused by the monks as the cause of his temporal and eternal perdition Superstition and weakness formed the cha racter of Michael I but the saints and images were incapable of supporting their votary on the throne In the purple Leo V asserted the name and religion of an Armenian and the idols with their seditious adherents were condemned to a se cond exile Their applause would have sanctified the murder of aii impious tyrant but his assassin and successor the second Michael was tainted from his birth with the Phrygian heresies he attempted to mediate between the contending parties and the intractable spirit of the catholics insensibly cast him into the opposite scale His moderation was guarded by timidity but his son Theophilus alike ignorant of fear and pity was the last and most cruel of the Iconoclasts The en thusiam of the times ran strongly against them and the emperors who stemmed the torrent were exasperated and punished by the public hatred After the death of Theophilus the final victory of the images was achieved by a second female his widow Theodora whom he left the guardian of the empire Her measures were bold and decisive The fiction of a tardy repentance absolved the fame and the soul of her deceased husband the sentence of the Iconoclast patriarch was commuted from the loss of his eyes to a whipping of two hundred lashes the bi shops trembled the monks shouted and the festival of orthodoxy preserves the annual memory of the triumph of the images A single question yet remained whether they are endowed with any proper and inherent sanctity it was agitated by the Greeks of the eleventh century 2 and as this opinion has the strongest re commendation of absurdity I am surprised that it was not more explicitly decided in the affirmative In the west pope Hadrian I accepted and announced the de crees of the Nicene assembly which is now revered by the catholics as the se venth in rank of the general councils Rome and Italy were docile to the voice efi their father but the greatest part of the Latin Christians were far behind in the race of superstition The churches of France Germany England and Spain steered a middle

reformation and of the countries both in Europe and America which are still immersed in the gloom of superstition It was after the Nicene synod and under the reign of the pious Irene that the popes consummated the separation of Rome and Italy by the translation of the empire to the less orthodox Charlemagne They were compelled to choose be tween the rival nations religion was not the sole motive of their choice and while they dissembled the failings of their friends they beheld with reluctance and sus Sicion the catholic virtues of their foes The difference of language and manners ad perpetuated the enmity of the two capitals and they were alienated from each other by the hostile opposition of seventy years In that schism the Romans had tasted of freedom and the popes of sovereignty their submission would have exposed them to the revenge of a jealous tyrant and the revolution of Italy had betrayed the impotence as well as the tyranny of the Byzantine court The Greek

threatens them with a sentence of excommunication unless they speedily abjure this practical heresy The Greeks were now orthodox but their religion might be tainted by the breath of the reigning

he recovered his speech and sight and this natural event was improved to the miraculous restoration of his eyes and tongue of which he had been deprived twice deprived by the knife of the as sassins 3 From his prison he escaped to the Vatican the duke of Spoleto hastened to his rescue Charlemagne sympathized in his injury and in his camp of Pader born in Westphalia accepted or solicited a visit from the Roman pontiff Leo re passed the Alps with a commission of counts and bishops the guards of his safety and the judges of his innocence and it was not without reluctance that the conqueror of the Saxons delayed till the ensuing year the personal discharge of this pious office In his fourth and last pilgrimage he was received at Rome with the due honours of king and patrician Leo was permitted to purge himself by oath of the crimes imputed to his charge his enemies were silenced and the sacrilegious attempt against his life was punished by the mild and insufficient penalty of exile On the festival of Christmas the last year of the eighth century Charlemagne appeared in the church of St Peter and to gratify the vanity of Rome he had exchanged the simple dress of his country for the habit of a patrician 4 After the celebration of the holy mysteries Leo suddenly placed a precious crown on his head 5 and the dome resounded with the acclamations of the people â  Long life

DECLINE AND FALL The appellation of great has been often bestowed and sometimes deserved but Charlemagne is the only prince in whose favour the title has been indissolubly blended with the name That name with the addition of saint is inserted in the Roman calendar and the saint by a rare felicity is crowned with the praises of the historians and philosophers of an enlightened age l His real merit is doubt less enhanced by the barbarism of the nation and the times from which he emerged but the afifiarent magnitude of an object is likewise enlarged by an unequal com parison and the ruins of Palmyra derive a casual splendour from the nakedness of the surrounding desert Without injustice to his fame I may discern some blemishes in the sanctity and greatness of the restorer of the western empire Of his moral virtues chastity is not the most conspicuous 2 but the public happiness could not be materially injured by his nine wives or concubines the various indul gence of meaner or more transient amours the multitude of his bastards whom he bestowed on the church and the long celibacy and licentious manners of his daughters 3 whom the father was suspected of loving with too fond a passion I shall be scarcely permitted to accuse the ambition of a conqueror but in a day of equal retribution the sons of his brother Carloman the Merovingian princes of Aquitain and the four thousand five hundred Saxons who were beheaded on the same spot would have something to allege against the justice and humanity of Charlemagne His treatment of the vanquished Saxons 4 was an abuse of the right of conquest his laws were not less sanguinary than his arms and in the dis cussion of his motives whatever is subtracted from bigotry must be imputed to temper The sedentary reader is amazed by his incessant activity of mind and body and his subjects and enemies were not less astonished at his sudden pre sence at the moment when they believed him at the most distant extremity of the empire neither peace nor war nor summer nor winter were a season of repose and our fancy cannot easily reconcile the annals of his reign with the geography of his expeditions But this activity was a national rather than a personal virtue the vagrant life of a Frank was spent in the chase in pilgrimage in military ad ventures and the journeys of Charlemagne were distinguished only by a more nu merous train and a more important purpose His military renown must be tried by the scrutiny of his troops his enemies and his actions Alexander conquered with the arms of Philip but the two heroes who preceded Charlemagne be queathed him their name their examples and the companions of their victories At the head of his veteran and superior armies he oppressed the savage or dege nerate nations who were incapable of confederating for their common safety nor did he ever encounter an equal antagonist in numbers in discipline or in arms The science of war has been lost and revived with the arts of peace but his cam paigns are not illustrated by any siege or battle of singular difficulty or success and he might behold with envy the Saracen trophies of his grandfather After his Spanish expedition his rear guard was defeated in the Pyrenian mountains and the soldiers whose situation was irretrievable and whose valour was useless might accuse with their last breath the want of skill or caution of

of the Franks and his attempts however fee ble and imperfect are deserving of praise the inveterate evils of the times were suspended or mollified by his governmental but in his institutions I can seldom discover the general views and the immortal spirit of a legislator who survives himself for the benefit of posterity The union and stability of his empire de pended on the life of a single man he imitated the dangerous practice of dividing his kingdoms among his sons and after his numerous diets the whole constitution was left to fluctuate between the disorders of anarchy and despotism His esteem for the piety and knowledge of the clergy tempted him to intrust that aspiring order with temporal dominion and civil jurisdiction and his son Lewis when he was stripped and degraded by the bishops might accuse in some measure the imprudence of his father His laws enforced the imposition of tithes because the demons had proclaimed in the air that the default of payment had been the cause of the last scarcity 2 The literary merits of Charlemagne are attested by the foundation of schools the introduction of arts the works which were published in his name and his familiar connexion with the subjects and strangers whom he in vited to his court to educate both the prince and people His own studies were tardy laborious and imperfect if he spoke Latin and understood Greek he de rived the rudiments of knowledge from conversation rather than from books and in his mature age the emperor strove to acquire the practice of writing which every peasant now leams in his infancy 3 The grammar

and evasive conquest the re bellion of the dukes of Aquitain was punished by the forfeiture of their province their liberty and their lives Harsh and rigorous would have been such treatment of

coun try assumed the independent title of prince and opposed his sword to the Car lovingian monarchy His defence was firm his submission was not inglorious and the emperor was content with an easy tribute the demolition of his fortresses â and acknowledgment on his coins of a supreme lord The artful flattery of his Son Grimoald added the appellation of father but he asserted his dignity with pru dence and Beneventum insensibly escaped from the French yoke 3 IV Char lemagne was the first who united Germany under the same sceptre The name of Oriental France is preserved in the circle of

After the reduction of Pannonia the empire of Charle magne was bounded only by the conflux of the Danube with the Teyss and the Save the provinces of Istria Libumia and Dalmatia were an easy though un profitable accession and it was an effect of his moderation that he left the ma ritime cities under the real or nominal sovereignty of the Greeks But these dis tant possessions added more to the reputation than to the power of the Latin em peror nor did he risk any ecclesiastical foundations to reclaim the barbarians from their vagrant life and idolatrous worship Some canals of communication between the river the Saone and the Meuse the Rhine and the Danube were faintly at tempted 2 Their execution would have vivified the empire and more cost and labour were often wasted in the structure of a cathedral If we retrace the outlines of this geographical picture it will be seen that the empire of the Franks extended between east and west from the Ebro to the Elbe or Vistula between the north and south from the duchy of Beneventum to the river Eyder the perpetual boundary of Germany and Denmark The personal and political importance of Charlemagne was magnified by the distress and division of the rest of Europe The islands of Great Britain and Ireland were disputed by a crowd of princes of Saxon or Scottish origin and after the loss of Spain the Christian and Gothic kingdom of Alphonso the Chaste was confined to the nar row range of the Aslurian mountains These petty sovereigns revered the power or virtue of the Carlovingian monarch implored the honour and support of his al liance and styled him their common parent the sole and supreme emperor of the west 3 He maintained a more equal intercourse with the caliph Harun al Rashid 4 whose dominion stretched from Africa to India and accepted from his ambassadors a tent a water clock an elephant and the keys of the holy sepulchre It is not easy to conceive the private friendship of a Frank and an Arab who were strangers to each other s person and language and religion but their public cor respondence was founded on vanity and their remote situation left no room for a competition of interest Two thirds of the western empire of Rome were subject to Charlemagne and the deficiency was amply supplied by his command of the inaccessible or invincible nations of Germany But in the choice of his enemies we may be reasonably surprised that he so often preferred the poverty of the north to the riches of the south The three and thirty campaigns laboriously consumed in the woods and morasses of Germany would have sufficed to assert the ampli tude of his title by the expulsion of the Greeks from Italy and the Saracens from Spain The weakness of the Greeks would have ensured an easy victory and the oly crusade against the Saracens would have been prompted by glory and revenge and loudly justified by religion and policy Perhaps in his expeditions beyond the Rhine and the Elbe he aspired to save his monarchy from the fate of the Ro man empire to disarm the enemies of civilized society and to eradicate the seed of future emigrations But it has been wisely observed that in a light of precau tion all conquest must be ineffectual unless it could be universal since the in creasing circle must be involved in a larger sphere of hostility 5 The subjugation of Germany withdrew the veil which had so long

with their piratical fleets and Charlemagne beheld with a sigh the de structive progress of the Normans who in less than seventy years precipitated the fall of his race and monarchy Had the pope and the Romans revived the primitive constitution the titles of emperor and Augustus were conferred on Charlemagne for the term of his life and his successors on each vacancy must have ascended the throne by a formal or tacit election But the association of his son Lewis the Pious asserts the inde endent right of monarchy and conquest and the emperor seems on this occasion to lave foreseen and prevented the latent claims of the clergy The royal youth was commanded to take the crown from the altar and with his own hands to place it on his head as a gift which he held from God his father and the nation 1 The same ceremony was repeated though with less energy in the subsequent associa tions of Lothaire and Lewis II the Carlovingian sceptre was transmitted from father to son in a lineal descent of four generations and the ambition of the popes was reduced to the empty honour of crowning and anointing these hereditary princes who were already invested with the power and dominion The pious Lewis survived his brothers and embraced the whole empire of Charlemagne but the nations and the nobles his bishops and his children quickly discerned that this mighty mass was no longer inspired by the same soul and the foundations were undermined to the centre while the external surface was yet fair and entire Af ter a war or battle which consumed one hundred thousand Franks the empire was divided by treaty between his three sons who had violated every filial and fraternal duty The kingdoms of Germany and France were for ever separated the provinces of Gaul between the Rhone and the Alps the Meuse and the Rhine were assigned with Italy to the imperial dignity of Lothaire In the partition of his share Loraine and Aries two recent and transitory kingdoms were bestowed on the younger children and Lewis II his eldest son was content with the realm of Italy the proper and sufficient patrimony of a Roman emperor On his death without any male issue the vacant throne was disputed by his uncles and cousins and the popes most dexterously seized the occasion of judging the claims and me rits of the candidates and of bestowing on the most obsequious or most liberal the imperial office of advocate of the Roman church The dregs of the Carlo vingian race no longer exhibited any symptoms of virtue or power and the ridi culous epithets of the bald the stammerer the fat and the simfile distinguished the tame and uniform features of a crowd of kings alike deserving of oblivion By the failure of the collateral branches the whole inheritance devolved to Charles the Fat the last emperor of his family his insanity authorized the desertion of Germany Italy and France he was deposed in a diet and solicited his daily bread from the rebels by whose contempt his life and

illegitimate blood of Charlemagne Of the greater part the title and possession were alike doubtful and the merit was adequate to the contracted scale of their dominions Those who could appear with an

Christianity was propagated by the sword of Otho the conqueror and apostle of the Slavic nations of the Elbe and Oder the marches of Brandenburg and Sleswick were fortified with German colonies and the king of Denmark the dukes of Po land and Bohemia confessed themselves his tributary vassals At the head of a vic torious army he passed the Alps subdued the kingdom of Italy delivered the pope and for ever fixed the imperial crown in the name and nation of Germany From that memorable era two maxims of public jurisprudence were introduced by force and ratified by time I That the prince who was elected in the German diet ac quired from that instant the subject kingdoms of Italy and Rome II But that he might not legally assume the titles of emperor and Augustus till he had re ceived the crown from the hands of the Roman pontiff 1 The imperial dignity of Charlemagne was announced to the east by the altera tion of his style and instead of saluting his fathers the Greek emperors he pre sumed to adopt the more equal and familiar appellation of brother 2 Perhaps in his connexion with Irene he aspired to the name of husband his embassy to Constantinople spoke the language of peace and friendship and might conceal a treaty of marriage with that ambitious princess who had renounced the most sa cred duties of a mother The nature the duration the probable consequences of such a union between two distant and dissonant empires it is impossible to con jecture but the unanimous silence of the Latins may teach us to suspect that the report was invented by the enemies of Irene to chargat her with the guilt of be traying the church and state to the strangers of the west 3 The French am bassadors were the spectators and had nearly been the victims of the conspiracy of Nicephorus and the national hatred Constantinople was exasperated by the treason and sacrilege of ancient Rome a proverb  That the Franks were good friends and bad neighbours was in every one s mouth but it was dangerous to provoke a neighbour who might be tempted to reiterate in the church of St So phia the ceremony of his imperial coronation After a tedious journey of circuit and delay the ambassadors of Nicephorus found him in his camp on the banks of the river Sala and Charlemagne affected to confound their vanity by displaying in a Franconian village the pomp or at least the pride of the Byzantine palace 4 The Greeks were successively led through four halls of audience in the first they were ready to fall prostrate before a splendid personage in a chair of state till he informed them that he was only a servant the constable or master of the horse of the emperor The same mistake and the same answer were repeated in the apartments of the count palatine the steward and the chamberlain and their im patience was gradually heightened till the doors of the presence chamber were thrown open and they beheld the genuine monarch on his throne enriched with the foreign luxury which he despised and encircled with the love and reverence of his victorious chiefs A treaty of alliance was concluded between the two em pires and the limits of the east and west were defined by the right of present pos session But the Greeks 5 soon forgot this humiliating equality or remembered it only to hate the barbarians by whom it was extorted During the short union of virtue and power they respectfully saluted the august Charlemagne with the acclamations of basileus and emperor of the Romans As soon as these qualities were separated in the person of his pious son the Byzantine letters were inscribed

To the king or as he styles himself the emperor of the Franks and Lom bards When both power and virtue were extinct they despoiled Lewis II op his hereditary title and with the barbarous appellation of rex or rega degraded him among the crowd of Latin princes His reply l is expressive of his weak ness he proves with some learning that both in sacred and profane history the name of king is synonymous with the Greek word basileus if at Constantinople it were assumed in a more exclusive and imperial sense he claims from his ances tors and from the pope a just participation of the honours of the Roman purple The same controversy was revived in the reign of the Othos and their ambassa dor describes in lively colours the insolence of the Byzantine court 2 The Greeks affected to despise the poverty and ignorance of the Franks and Saxons and in their last decline refused to prostitute to the kings of Germany the title of Roman emperors These emperors in the election of the popes continued to exercise the powers  which had been assumed by the Gothic and Grecian princes and the importance of this prerogative increased with the temporal estate and spiritual jurisdiction of the Roman church In the Christian aristocracy the principal members of the clergy still formed a senate to assist the administration and to supply the vacancy of the bishop Rome was divided into twenty eight parishes and each parish was governed by a cardinal priest or presbyter a title which however common and modest in its origin has aspired to emulate the purple of kings Their number was enlarged by the association of the seven deacons of the most considerable hos pitals the seven palatine judges of the Lateran and some dignitaries of the church The ecclesiastical senate was directed by the seven cardinal bishops of the Roman province who were less occupied in the superb diocesses of Ostia Porto Velitrse Tusculum Prxneste Tibur and the Sabines than by their weekly service in the Lateran and their superior share in the honours and authority of the apostolic see On the death of the pope these bishops recommended a suc cessor to the suffrage of the college of cardinals 3 and their choice was ratified or rejected by the applause or clamour of the Roman people But the election was imperfect nor could the pontiff be legally consecrated till the emperor the advo cate of the church had graciously signified his approbation and consent The royal commissioner examined on the spot the form and freedom of the proceed ings nor was it till after a previous scrutiny into the qualifications of the candi dates that he accepted an oath of fidelity and confirmed the donations which had successively enriched the patrimony of St Peter In the frequent schisms the rival claims were submitted to the sentence of the emperor and in a synod of bi shops he presumed to judge to condemn and to punish the crimes of a guilty pontiff Otho I imposed a treaty on the senate and people who engaged to pre fer the candidate most acceptable to his majesty 4 his successors anticipated or prevented their choice they bestowed the Roman benefice like the bishoprics of Cologne or Bamberg on their chancellors or preceptors and whatever might be the merit of a Frank or Saxon his name sufficiently attests the interposition of foreign power These acts of prerogative were most speciously excused by the vices of a popular election The competitor who had been excluded by the cardinals ap pealed to the passions or avarice of the multitude the Vatican and the Lateran were stained with blood and the most powerful senators the marquises of Tusca ny and the counts of Tusculum held the apostolic see in a long and disgraceful servitude The Roman pontiffs of the ninth and tenth centuries

seated in the chair of St Peter and it was at the age of nineteen years that the second of these became the head of the Latin church His youth and manhood were of a suitable complexion and the nations of pilgrims could bear testimony to the charges that were urged against him in a Roman synod and in the presence of Otho the great As John XII had renounced the dress and decencies of his pro fession the soldier may not perhaps be dishonoured by the wine which he drank the blood that he spilt the flames that he kindled or the licentious pursuits of gaming and hunting His open simony might be the consequence of distress and his blasphemous invocation of Jupiter and Venus if it be time could not possibly be serious But we read with some surprise that the worthy grandson of Marozia lived in public adultery with the matrons of Rome that the Lateran palace was turned into a school for prostitution and that his rapes of virgins and widows had deterred the female pilgrims from visiting the tomb of St Peter lest in the devout act they should be violated by his successor 6 The protestants have dwelt with malicious pleasure on these characters of antichrist but to a philosophic eye the vices of the clergy are far less dangerous than their virtues After a long series of scandal the apostolic see was reformed and exalted by the austerity and zeal of Gregory VII That ambitious monk devoted his life to the execution of two projects I To fix in the college of cardinals the freedom and independence of election and for ever to abolish the right or usurpation of the emperors and the Roman people II To bestow and resume the western empire as a fief or be nefice of the church and to extend his temporal dominion over kings and king doms of the earth After a contest of fifty years the first of these designs was accomplished by the firm support of the ecclesiastical order whose liberty was connected with that of their chief But the second attempt though it was crowned with some partial and apparent success has been vigorously resisted by the secular power and finally extinguished by the improvement of human reason In the revival of the empire of Rome neither the bishop nor the people could bestow on Charlemagne or Otho the provinces which were lost as they had been won by the chance of arms But the Romans were free to choose a master 1 T e oppression and vices of the

late as the thir teenth century was derived from Caesar to the prefect of the city 2 Between the arts of the popes and the violence of the people this supremacy was crushed and annihilated Content with the titles of emperor and Augustus the succes sors of Charlemagne neglected to assert this local jurisdiction In the hour of prosperity their ambition was diverted by more alluring objects and in the decay and division of the empire they were oppressed by the defence of their hereditary provinces Amidst the ruins of Italy the famous Marozia invited one of the usurpers to assume the character of her third husband and Hugh king of Bur gundy was introduced by her faction into the mole of Hadrian or castle of St An gelo which commands the principal bridge and entrance of Rome Her son by the first marriage Alberic was compelled to attend at the nuptial banquet but his reluctant and ungraceful service was chastised with a blow by his new father The blow was productive of a revolution Romans exclaimed the youth once you were the masters of the world and these Burgundians the most abject of your slaves They now reign these voracioos and brutal savages and my in jury is the commencement of your servitude 3 The alarum bell was rung to arms in every quarter of the city the Burgundians retreated with haste and shame Marozia was imprisoned by her victorious son and his brother pope John XL was reduced to the exercise of his spiritual functions With the title of prince Alberic possessed above twenty years the government of Rome and he is said to have gratified the popular prejudice by restoring the office or at least the title of consuls and tribunes His son and heir Octavian assumed with the pontificate the name of John XII like his predecessor he was provoked by the Lombard princes to seek a deliverer for the church and republic and the services of Otho were rewarded with the imperial dignity But the Saxon was imperious the Ro mans were impatient the festival of the coronation was disturbed by the secret conflict of prerogative and freedom and Otho commanded his sword bearer not to stir from his person lest he should be assaulted and murdered at the foot of the altar 4 Before he repassed the Alps the emperor chastised the revolt of the people and the ingratitude of John XII The pope was degraded in a synod the prefect was mounted on an ass whipped through the city and cast into a dun geon thirteen of the most guilty were hanged others were mutilated or banished and this severe process was justified by the ancient laws of Theodosius and Justi nian The voice of fame has accused the second Otho of a perfidious and bloody act the massacre of the senators whom he had invited to his table under the fair semblance of hospitality and

presence odious and formi dable They descended from the Alps at the head of their barbarians who were strangers and enemies to the country and their transient visit was a scene of tu mult and bloodshed 2 A faint remembrance of their ancestors still tormented the Romans and they beheld with pious indignation the succession of Saxons Franks Svvabians and Bohemians who usurped the purple and prerogatives of the Caesars There is nothing perhaps more adverse to nature and reason than to hold in obedience remote countries and foreign nations in opposition to their inclination and interest A torrent of barbarians may pass over the earth but an extensive empire must be supported by a refined system of policy and oppression in the centre an absolute power prompt in action and rich in resources a swift and easy communication with the extreme parts fortifications to check the first effort of rebellion a regular administration to protect and punish and a well disciplined army to inspire fear without provoking discontent and despair Far different was the situation of the German Cscsars who were ambitious to enslave the kingdom of Italy Their patrimonial estates were stretched along the Rhine or scattered in the provinces but this ample domain was alienated by the imprudence or dis tress of successive princes and their revenue from minute and vexatious preroga tive was scarcely sufficient for the maintenance of their household Their troops were formed by the legal or voluntary service of their feudal vassals who passed the Alps with reluctance assumed the license of rapine and disorder and capriciously deserted before the end of the campaign Whole armies were swept away by the pestilential influence of the climate the survivors brought back the bones of their princes and nobles 3 and the effects of their own intemperance were often im puted to the treachery and malice of the Italians who rejoiced at least in the cala mities of the barbarians This irregular tyranny might contend on equal terms with the petty tyrants of Italy nor can the people or the reader be much inte rested in the event of the quarrel But in the eleventh and twelfth centuries the Lombards rekindled the flame of industry and freedom and the generous example was at length imitated by the republics of Tuscany In the Italian cities a mu nicipal government had never beeu totally abolished and their first privileges were granted by the favour and policy of the emperors who were desirous of erecting a plebeian barrier against the independence of the nobles But their rapid

Frederic I invaded the re publics of Lombardy with the arts of a statesman the valour of a soldier and the crueltv of a tyrant The recent discovery of the Pandects had renewed a science most

in the treaty of Constance Frederic sub scribed with some reservations the freedom of four and twenty cities His grand son contended with their vigour and maturity but Frederic 11 3 was endowed with some personal and peculiar advantages His birth and education recom mended him to the Italians and in the implacable discord of the two factions the Ghibelins were attached to the emperor while the Guelfs displayed the banner of liberty and the church The rourt of Rome had slumbered when his father Henry VI was permitted to unite with the empire the kingdoms of Naples and Sicily and from these hereditary realms the son derived an ample and ready supply of troops and treasure Yet Frederic II was finally oppressed by the arms of the Lombards and the thunders of the Vatican his kingdom was given to a stranger and the last of his family was beheaded at Naples on a public scaffold During sixty years no emperor appeared in Italy and the name was remembered only by the ignominious sale of the last relics of sovereignty The barbarian conquerors of the west were pleased to decorate their chief with the title of emperor but it was not their design to invest him with the despotism of Constantine and Justinian The persons of the Germans were free their con quests were their own and their national character was animated by a spirit which scorned the servile jurisprudence of the new or the ancient Roman It would have been a vain and dangerous attempt to impose a monarch on the armed freemen who were impatient of a magistrate on the bold who refused to obey on the powerful who aspired to command The empire of Charlemagne and Otho was distributed among the dukes of the nations or provinces the counts of the smaller districts and the margraves of the marches or frontiers who all united the civil and military authority as it had been delegated to the lieutenants of the first Caesars The Roman governors who for the most part were soldiers of fortune seduced their mercenary legions assumed the imperial purple and either failed or suc ceeded in their revolt without wounding the power and unity of government If the dukes margraves and counts of Germany were less audacious in theirclaims the consequences of their success were more lasting and pernicious to the state Instead of ainiing at the supreme rank they silently laboured to establish and ap propriate their

Germanic kingdom In every province the risible presence of the duke or count was interposed between the throne and the lobles the subjects of the law became the vassals of a private chief and the stand ard which he received from his sovereign was often raised against him in the field The temporal power of the clergy was cherished and exalted by the super stition or policy of the Carlovingian and Saxon dynasties who blindly depended on their moderation and fidelity and the bishoprics of Germany were made equal in extent and privilege superior in wealth and population to the most ample states of the military order As long as the emperors retained the prerogative of be stowing on every vacancy these ecclesiastic and secular benefices their cause was maintained by the gratitude or ambition of their friends and favourites But in the quarrel of the investitures they were deprived of their influence over the epis copal chapters the freedom of election was restored and the sovereign was re duced by a solemn mockery to his first prayers the recommendation once in his reign to a single prebend in each church The secular governors instead of being recalled at the will of a superior could be degraded only by the sentence of their peers In the first age of the monarchy the appointment of the son to the duchy or county of his father was solicited as a favour it was gradually obtained as a custom and extorted as a right the lineal succession was often extended to the collateral or female branches the states of the empire their popular and at â  length their legal appellation were divided and alienated by testament and sale and all idea of a public trust was lost in that of a private and perpetual inheritance The emperor could not even be enriched by the casualties of forfeiture and ex tinction within the term of a year he was obliged to dispose of the vacant fief and in the choice of the candidate it was his duty to consult either the general or the provincial diet After the death of Frederic II Germany was left a monster with a hundred heads A crowd of princes and prelates disputed the ruins of the empire the lords of the innumerable castles were less prone to obey than to imitate their su periors and according to the measure of their strength their incessant hostilities received the names of conquest or robbery Such anarchy was the inevitable con sequence of the laws and manners of Europe and the kingdoms of France and Italy were shivered into fragments by the violence of the same tempest But the Italian cities and the French vassals were divided and destroyed while the union of the Germans had produced under the name of an empire a great system of a federative republic In the frequent and at lastthe perpetual institution of diets a national spirit was kept alive and the powers of a common legislature are still exercised by the three branches or colleges of the electors the princes and the free and imperial cities of Germany I Seven of the most powerful feudatories were permitted to assume with a distinguished name and rank the exclusive pri vilege of choosing the Roman emperor and these electors were the king of Bo hemia the duke of Saxony the margrave of Brandenburg the count palatine of the Rhine and the three archbishops of Mentz of Treves and of Cologne II The college of princes and prelates purged themselves of a promiscuous multitude they reduced to four representative votes the long series of independent counts and excluded the nobles or equestrian order sixtv thousand of whom as in the Polish diets had appeared on horseback in the field of election III The pride of birth and dominion of the sword and the mitre wisely adopted the commons as the third branch of the legislature and in the progress of society they were introduced about the same era into the national assemblies of France England and Germany The Hanseatic league commanded the trade and navigation of the north the confederates of the Rhine secured the peace and intercourse of the inland country the influence of the cities has been adequate to their wealth and policy and their negative still invalidates the acts

â and contrast of the Roman empire of Germany which no longer held except on the borders of the Rhine and Danube a single province of Trajan or Constantine Their unworthy successors were the counts of Hapsburg of Nassau of Luxem burgh and of Schwartzenburgh the emperor Henry VIL procured for his son the crown of Bohemia and his grandson Charles IV was born among a people strange and barbarous in the estimation of the Germans themselves 1 After the ex communication of Lewis of Bavaria he received the gift or promise of the vacant empire from the Roman pontiffs who in the exile and captivity of Avignon af fected the dominion of the earth The death of his competitors united the elec toral college and Charles was unanimously saluted king of the Romans and future emperor a title which in the same age was prostituted to the Cssars of Germa ny and Greece The German emperor was no more than the elective and impo tent magistrate of an aristocracy of princes who had not left him a village that he might call his own His best prerogative was the right of presiding and pro posing in the national senate which was convened at his summons and his native Kingdom of Bohemia less opulent than the adjacent city of Nuremburg was the firmest seat of his power and the richest source of his revenue The army with which he passed the Alps consisted of three hundred horse In the cathedral of St Ambrose Charles was crowned with the iron crown which tradition ascribed to the Lombard monarchy but he was admitted only with a peaceful train the gates of the city were shut upon him and the king of Italy was held a captive by the arms of the Visconti whom he confirmed in the sovereignty of Milan In the Vatican he was again crowned with the golden crown of the empire but in obe dience to a secret treaty the Roman emperor immediately withdrew without re posing a single night within the walls of Rome The eloquent Petrarch 2 whose fancy revived the visionary glories of the capitol deplores and upbraids the igno minious flight of the Bohemian and even his cotemporaries could observe that the sole exercise of his authority was in the lucrative sale of privileges and titles The gold of Italy secured the election of his son but such was the shameful po verty of the Roman emperor that his person was arrested by a butcher in the streets of Worms and was detained in the public inn as a pledge or hostage for the payment of his expenses From this humiliating scene let us turn to the apparent majesty of the same Charles in the diets of the empire The golden bull which fixes the Germanic constitution is promulgated in the style of a sovereign and legislator A hundred princes bowed before his throne and exalted their own dignity by the voluntary honours which they yielded to their chief or minister At the royal banquet the hereditary great officers the seven electors who in rank and title were equal to kings performed their solemn and domestic service of the palace The seals of the triple kingdom were borne in state by the archbishops of Mentz Cologne and Treves the perpetual arch chancellors of Germany Italy and Aries The great marshal on horseback exercised his function with a silver measure of oats which he emptied on the ground and immediately dismounted to regulate the order of the guests The great steward the count palatine of the Rhine placed the dishes on the table The great chamberlain the margrave of Brandenburg Sresented after the repast the golden ewer and basin to wash The king of Bo emia as great cup bearer was represented by the emperor s brother the duke of Luxemburg and Brabant and the procession was closed by the great huntsman who introduced a boar and a stag with a loud chorus of horns and hounds 3 Nor was the supremacy of the emperor confined to Germany alone the heredi tary monarchs of Europe confessed the pre eminence of his rank and dignity be was the first of the Christian princes the temporal head of the great republic of

must not be considered as a harharian After his education at Paris he reco vered the use of the Bohemian his native idiom and the emperor conversed and wrote with equal facility in French Latin Italian and Gel man Struvius p 615 610 Petrarch always represents him as a polite and learned prince â 2 Besides the German and Italian historians the expedition of Charles IV is painted in lively and

ceremony in Strrrriiis p 629 OF THE ROMAK EMPIRE 50J the west f 1 to his person the title of majesty was long appropriated and he dis puted with the pope the sublime prerogative of creating kings and assembling councils The oracle of the civil law the learned Bartolus was a pensioner of Charles IV and his school resounded with the doctrine that the Roman emperor wasthe rightful sovereign of the earth from the rising to the setting sun The contrary opinion was condemned not as an error but as a heresy since even the gospel had pronounced  And there went forth a decree from Csesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed 2 If we annihilate the interval of time and space between Augustus and Charles strong and striking will be the contrast between the two Caesars the Bohemian who concealed his weakness under the mask of ostentation and the Roman who disguised his strength under the semblance of modesty At the head of his victo rious legions in his reign over the sea and land from the Nile and Euphrates to the Atlantic ocean Augustus professed himself the servant of the state and the equal of his fellow citizens The conqueror of Rome and her provinces assumed the popular and legal forms of a censor a consul and a tribune His will was the law of mankind but in the declaration of his laws he borrowed the voice of the senate and people and from their decrees their master accepted and renewed his temporary commission to administer to the republic In his dress his domes tics 3 his titles in all the offices of social life Augustus maintained the character of a private Roman and his most artful flatterers respected the secret of his ab solute and perpetual monarchy CHAPTER L Description of Arabia and its inhabitants â Birth character and doctrine of Mahomet â

state was exhausted by the Persian war and the church was distracted by the Nestorian and Monophysite sects Mahomet with the sword in one hand and the Koran in the other erected his throne on the ruins of Christianity and of Rome The genius of the Arabian prophet the man ners of his nation and the spirit of his religion involve the causes of the decline and fall of the eastern empire and our eyes are curiously intent on one of the most memorable revolutions which have impressed a new and lasting character on the nations of the globe 4 In the vacant space between Persia Syria Egypt and Ethiopia the Arabian peninsula 5 may be conceived as a triangle of spacious but irregular dimensions 1 The republic of Europe with the pope and emperor at its heads was never represented with more dig

804 THE DECLINE AND FALL From the northern point of Beles l on the Euphrates a line of fifteen hundred miles is terminated by the straits of Babelmandel and the land of frankincense About half this length may be allowed for the middle breadth from east to west from Bassorato Suez from the Persian gulf to the Red Sea 2 The sides of the triangle are gradually enlarged and the southern basin presents a front of a thousand miles to the Indian ocean The entire surface of the peninsula exceeds in a fourfold proportion that of Germany or France but the far greater part has been justly stigmatized with the epithets of the stony and the sandy Even the wilds of Tartary are decked by the hand of nature with lofty trees and luxuriant herbage and the lonesome traveller derives a sort of comfort and society from the presence of vegetable life But in the dreary waste of Arabia a boundless level of sand is intersected by sharp and naked mountains and the face of the desert without shade or shelter is scorched by the direct and intense rays of a tropical sun Instead of refreshing breezes the winds particularly from the south west diffuse a noxious and even deadly vapour the hillocks of sand which they alter nately raise and scatter are compared to the billows of the ocean and whole ca ravans whole armies have been lost and buried in the whirlwind The common benefits of water are an object of desire and contest and such is the scarcity of wood that some art is requisite to preserve and propagate the element of fire Arabia is destitute of navigable rivers which fertilize the soil and convey its pro duce to the adjacent regions the torrents that fall from the hills are imbibed by the thirsty earth the rare and hardy plants the tamarind or the acacia that strike their roots into the clefts of the rocks are nourished by the dews of the night a scanty supply of rain is collected in cisterns and aqueducts the wells and springs are the secret treasure of the desert and the pilgrim of Mecca 3 after many a dry and sultry march is disgusted by the taste of the waters which have rolled over a bed of sulphur or salt Such is the general and genuine picture of the climate of Arabia The experience of evil enhances the value of any local or partial enjoyments A shady grove a green pasture a stream of fresh water are sufficient to attract a colony of sedentary Arabs to the fortunate spots which can afford food and refreshment to themselves and their cattle and which encou rage their industry in the cultivation of the palm tree and the vine The high lands that border on the Indian ocean are distinguished by their superior plenty of wood and water the air is more temperate the fruits are more delicious the ani mals and the human race more numerous the fertility of the soil invites and re wards the toil of the husbandman and the peculiar gifts of frankincense 4 and coffee have attracted in different ages the merchants of the world If it be com pared with the rest of the peninsula this sequestered region may truly deserve the appellation of the happy and the splendid colouring of fancy and fiction has been suggested by contrast and countenanced by distance It was for this earthly pa radise that nature had reserved her choicest favours and her most curious work manship the incompatible blessings of luxury and innocence were ascribed to the natives the soil was impregnated with gold 5 and gems and both the land and sea were taught to exhale the odours of aromatic sweets This division of the sandy the stony and the happy so familiar to the Greeks and Latins is unknown to the Arabians themselves and it is singular enough that a country whose lan guage and inhabitants have ever been the same should scarcely retain a vestige of its ancient geography The

displays the limits or at least the situation of Arabia Felix the name of Neged is extended over the inland space and the birth of Mahomet has illustrated the province of Hejaz along the coast of the Red Sea l The measure of population is regulated by the means of subsistence and the in habitants of this vast peninsula might be outnumbered by the subjects of a fertile and industrious province Along the shores of the Persian gulf of the ocean and even of the Red Sea the Icthyofihagi 2 or fish eaters continued to wander in quest of their precarious food In this primitive and abject state which ill de serves the name of society the human brute without art or laws almost without sense or language is poorly distinguished from the rest of the animal creation Generations and ages might roll away in silent oblivion and the helpless savage was restrained from multiplying his race by the wants and pursuits which con fined his existence to the narrow margin of the sea coast But at an early period of antiquity the great body of the Arabs had emerged from this scene of misery and as the naked wilderness could not maintain a people of hunters they rose at once to the more secure and plentiful condition of the pastoral life The same life is uniformly pursued by the roving tribes of the desert and in the portrait of the modern Bedovieens we may trace the features of their ancestors 3 who in the age of Moses or Mahomet dwelt under similar tents and conducted their horses and camels and sheep to the same springs and pastures Our toil is lessened and our wealth is increased by our dominion over the useful animals and the Arabian shepherd had acquired the absolute possession of a faithful friend and a laborious slave 4 Arabia in the opinion of the naturalist is the genuine and original country of the horse the climate most propitious not indeed to the size but to the spirit and swiftness of that generous animal The merit of the Barb the Spanish and the English breed is derived from a mixture of Arabian blood 5 the Bedoweens preserve with superstitious care the honours and the memory of the purest race the males are sold at a high price but the females are seldom alienated and the birth of a noble foal was esteemed among the tribes as a subject of joy and mutual congratulation These horses are educated in the tents among the children of the Arabs with a tender familiarity which trains them in the ha bits of gentleness and attachment They are accustomed only to walk and to gal lop their sensations are not blunted by the incessant abuse of the spur and the whip their powers are reserved for the moments of flight and pursuit but no sooner do they feel the touch of the hand or the stirrup than they dart away with the swiftness of the wind and if their friend be dismounted in the rapid career they instantly stop till he has recovered his seat In the sands of Africa and Ara bia the camel is a sacred and precious gift That strong and patient beast of bur den can perform without eating and drinking a journey of several days and a re servoir of fresh water is preserved in a large bag a fifth stomach of the animal whose body is imprinted with the marks of servitude the larger breed is capable of transporting a weight of a thousand pounds and the dromedary of a lighter and more active frame outstrips the fleetest courser in the race Alive or

is renewed is coarsely manufactured into the gar ments the furniture and the tents of the Bedoweens In the rainy seasons they consume the rare and insufficient herbage of the desert during the heats of sum mer and the scarcity of winter they remove their encampments to the sea coast the hills of Yemen or the neighbourhood of the Euphrates and have often ex torted the dangerous license of visiting the banks of the Nile and the villages of Syria and Palestine The life of a wandering Arab is a life of danger and distress and though sometimes by rapine or exchange he may appropriate the fruits of industry a private citizen in Europe is in the possession of more solid and pleasing luxury than the proudest emir who marches in the field at the head of ten thou sand horse Yet an essential difference may be found between the hordes of Scythia and the Arabian tribes since many of the latter were collected into towns and employed in the labours of trade and agriculture A part of their time and industry was still devoted to the management of their cattle they mingled in peace and war with their brethren of the desert and the Bedoweens derived from their useful intercourse some supply of their wants and some rudiments of art and know ledge A mong the forty two cities of Arabia 1 enumerated by Abulfeda the most ancient and populous were situate in the hafifty Yemen the towers of Saana 2 and the marvellous reservoir of Merab 3 were constructed by the kings of the Homerites but their profane lustre was eclipsed by the prophetic glories of Me dina 4 and Mf cca 5 near the Red Sea and at the distance from each other of two hundred and seventy miles The last of these holy places was known to the Greeks under the name of Macoraba and the termination of the word is expres sive of its greatness which has not indeed in the most flourishing period exceed ed the size and populousness of Marseilles Some latent motive perhaps of su perstition must have impelled the founders in the choice of a most unpro mising situation They erected their habitations of mud or stone in a plain about two miles long and one mile broad at the foot of three barren mountains the soil is a rock the water even of the holy well of Zemzem is bitter or brackish the pastures are remote from the city and grapes are transported above seventy miles from the gardens of Tayef The fame and spirit of the Koreishites who reigned in Mecca were conspicuous among the Arabian tribes but their ungrateful soil refused the labours of agriculture and their position was favourable to the enter prises of trade By the sea port of Gedda at the distance only of forty miles they maintained an easy correspondence with Abyssinia and that Christian kingdom afforded the first refuge to the disciples of Mahomet The treasures of Africa were conveyed over the peninsula to Gerrha or Katiff in the province of Bahrein a city built as it is said of rock salt by the Chaldean exiles 6 and from thence with the native pearls of the Persian gulf they were floated on rafts to the mouth of the Euphrates Mecca is placed almost at an equal distance a month s jour ney between Yemen on the right and Syria on

the streets of Mecca and the noblest of her sons united the love of arms with the profession of merchandise l The perpetual independence of the Arabs has been the theme of praise among strangers and natives and the arts of controversy transform this singular event into a prophecy and a miracle in favour of the posterity of Ismael 2 Some ex ceptions that can neither be dissembled nor eluded render this mode of reasoning as indiscreet as it is superfluous the kingdom of Yemen has been successively sub dued by the Abyssinians the Persians the sultans of Egypt 3 and the Turks 4 the holy cities of Mecca and Medina have repeatedly bowed under a Scythian ty rant and the Roman province of Arabia 5 embraced the peculiar wilderness in which Ismael and his sons must have pitched their tents in the face of their bre thren Yet these exceptions are temporary or local the body of the nation has escaped the yoke of the most powerful monarchies the arms of Sesostris and Cy rus of Pompey and Trajan could never achieve the conquest of Arabia the pre sent sovereign of the Turks 6 may exercise a shadow of jurisdiction but his pride is reduced to solicit the friendship of a people whom it is dangerous to pro voke and fruitless to attack The obvious causes of their freedom are inscribed on the character and country of the Arabs Many ages before Mahomet 7 their in trepid valour had been severely felt by their neighbours in offensive and defensive war The patient and active virtues of a soldier are insensibly nursed in the ha bits and discipline of a pastoral life The care of the sheep and camels is aban doned to the women of the tribe but the martial youth under the banner of the emir is ever on horseback and in the field to practise the exercise of the bow the javelin and the scimitar The long memory of their independence is the firmest pledge of its perpetuity and succeeding generations are animated to prove their descent and to maintain their inheritance Their domestic feuds are sus pended on the approach of a common enemy and in their last hostilities against the Turks the caravan of Mecca was attacked and pillaged by fourscore thousand of the confederates When they advance to battle the hope of victory is in the front in the rear the assurance of a retreat Their horses and camels who in eight or ten days can perform a march of four or five hundred miles disappear before the conqueror the secret waters of the desert elude his search and his victorious troops are consumed with thirst hunger and fatigue in the pursuit of an invisible foe who scorns his efforts and safely reposes in the heart of the burn ing solitude The arms and deserts of the Bedoweens are not only the safe guards of their own freedom but the barriers also of the happy Arabia whose inhabi tants remote from war are enervated by the luxury of the soil and climate The legions of Augustus melted away in disease and lassitude 8 and it is only by a naval power that the

mountains and the vicegerent of Chosroes was tempted to forget his distant country and his unfortunate master The historians of the age of Justinian represent the state of the independent Arabs who were divided by interest or affection in the long quar rel of the east the tribe of Gassan was allowed to encamp on the Syrian terri tory the princes of Hira were permitted to form a city about forty miles to the southward of the ruins of Babylon Their service in the field was speedy and vigorous but their friendship was venal their faith inconstant their enmity ca pricious it was an easier task to excite than to disarm these roving barbarians and in the familiar intercourse of war they learned to see and to despise the splendid weakness both of Rome and of Persia From Mecca to the Euphrates the Arabian tribes 2 were confounded by the Greeks and Latins under the ge neral appellation of Saracens 3 a name which every Christian mouth has been taught to pronounce with terror and abhorrence The slaves of domestic tyranny may vainly exult in their national independence but the Arab is personally free and he enjoys in some degree the benefits of so ciety without forfeiting the prerogatives of nature In every tribe superstition or gratitude or fortune has exalted a particular family above the heads of their equals The dignities of sheich and emir invariably descend in this chosen race but the order of succession is loose and precarious and the most worthy or aged of the noble kinsmen are preferred to the simple though important office of com posing disputes by their advice and guiding valour by their example Even a fe male of sense and spirit has been permitted to command the countrymen of Ze nobia 4 The momentary junction of several tribes produces an army their more lasting union constitutes a nation and the supreme chief the emir of emirs whose banner is displayed at their head may deserve in the eyes of strangers the honours of the kingly name If the Arabian princes abuse their power they are quickly punished by the desertion of their subjects who had been accustomed to a mild and parental jurisdiction Their spirit is free their steps are unconfined the de sert is open and the tribes and families are held together by a mutual and volun tary compact The softer natives of Yemen supported the pomp and majesty of a monarch but if he could not leave his palace without endangering hislife 5 the active powers of government must have been devolved on his nobles and ma gistrates The cities of Mecca and Medina present in the heart of Asia the form or rather the substance of a commonwealth The grandfather of Mahomet and his lineal ancestors appear in foreign and domestic transactions as the princes of their country but they reigned like Pericles at Athens or the Medici at Florence by the opinion of their wisdom and integrity  their influence was divided with their patrimony and the sceptre was transferred from the uncles of the prophet to a

and the sententious Arabs svoaM â probably have disdained the simple and sublime logic of Demosthenes OF THE ROMAN EMMRE which each member possessed an undivided share of the civil and political rights of the community In the more simple state of the Arabs the nation is free be cause each of her sons disdains a base submission to the will of a master His breast is fortified with the austere virtues of courage patience and sobriety the love of independence prompts him to exercise the habits of self command and the fear of dishonour guards him from the meaner apprehensions of pain of dan ger and of death The gravity and firmness of the mind are conspicuous in his outward demeanour his speech is slow weighty and concise he is seldom pro voked to laughter his only gesture is that of stroking his beard the venerable symbol of manhood and the sense of his own importance teaches him to accost his equals without levity and his superiors without awe l The liberty of the Saracens survived their conquest the first caliphs indulged the bold and familiar language of their subjects they ascended the pulpit to persuade and edify the con gregation nor was it before the seat of empire was removed to the Tigris that the Abbassides adopted the proud and pompous ceremonial of the Persian and Byzantine courts In the study of nations and men we may observe the causes that render them hostile or friendly to each other that tend to narrow or enlarge to molify or exas perate the social character The separation of the Arabs from the rest of man kind has accustomed them to confound the ideas of stranger and enemy and the poverty of the land has introduced a maxim of jurisprudence which they believe  and practise to the present hour They pretend that in the division of the earth the rich and fertile climates were assigned to the other branches of the human fa mily and that the posterity of the outlaw Ismael might recover by fraud or force the portion of inheritance of which he had been unjustly deprived According to the remark of Pliny the Arabian tribes are equally addicted to theft and mer chandise  the caravans that traverse the desert are ransomed or pillaged and their neighbours since the remote times of Job and Sesostris 2 have been the victims of their rapacious spirit If a Bedoween discovers from afar a solitary traveller he rides furiously against him crying with aloud voice Undress thyself thy aunt my wife is without a garment A ready submission entitled him to mercy resist ance will provoke the aggressor and his own blood must expiate the blood which he presumes to shed in legitimate defence A single robber or a few associates are branded with their genuine name but the exploits of a numerous band as sume the character of a lawful and honourable war The temper of a people thus armed against mankind was doubly inflamed by the domestic license of rapine murder and revenge In the constitution of Europe the right of peace and war is now confined to a small and the actual exercise to a much smaller list of res pectable potentates but each Arab with impunity and renown might point his javelin against the life of his countryman The union of the nation consisted only in a vague resemblance of language and manners and in each community the jurisdiction of the magistrate was mute and impotent Of the time of ignorance which preceded Mahomet seventeen hundred battles 3 are recorded by tradi tion hostility was imbittered with the rancour of civil faction and the recital in prose or verse of an obsolete feud was sufficient to rekindle the same passions among the descendants of the hostile tribes In private life every man at least every family was the judge and avenger of his own cause The nice sensibility of honour which weighs the insult rather than the injury sheds its deadly venom on the quarrels of the Arabs the honour of their women and of their beards is most easily wounded an indecent action a contemptuous word can be expi ated only by the blood of the offender and such is their patient inveteracy that they expect whole months and years the opportunity of revenge A fine or com  pensation for murder is familiar to the barbarians of every age but in Arabia the kinsman of the dead are at liberty to accept the atonement or to exercise with their own hands the law of retaliation The refined malice of the Arabs refuses 1 I mntt remind the reader that d Arvieux d Herbelot and Niebuhr represent in the most lively colours the manners and government of the Arabs which are illustrated

principal of the bloody debt are accumu lated the individuals of either family lead a life of malice and suspicion and fifty years may sometimes elapse before the account of vengeance be finally settled 1 This sanguinary spirit ignorant of pity or forgiveness has been moderated how ever by the maxims of honour which require in every private encounter some de cent equality of age and strength of numbers and weapons An annual festival of two perhaps of four months was observed by the Arabs before the time of Mahomet during which their swords were religiously sheathed both in foreign and domestic hostility and this partial truce is more strongly expressive of the habits of anarchy and warfare 2 But the spirit of rapine and revenge was attempered by the milder influence of trade and literature The solitary peninsula is encompassed by the most civilized na tions of the ancient world the merchant is the friend of mankind and the annual ca ravans imported the first seeds of knowledge and politeness into the cities and even the camps of the desert Whatever may be the pedigree of the Arabs their lan guage is derived from the same original stock of the Hebrew the Syriac and the Chaldean tongues the independence of the tribes was marked by their peculiar dia lects but each after their own allowed a just preference to the pure and perspi cuous idiom of Mecca In Arabia as well as in Greece the perfection of language outstripped the refinement of manners and her speech could diversify the fourscore names of honey the two hundred of a serpent the five hundred of a lion the thou sand of a sword at a time when this copious dictionary was intrusted to the memo ry of an illiterate people The monuments of the Homerites were inscribed with an obsolete and mysterious character but the Cufic letters the groundwork of the pre sent alphabet were invented on the banks of the Euphrates and the recent inven tion was taught at Mecca by a stranger who settled in that city after the birth of Ma homet The arts of grammar of metre and of rhetoric were unknown to the free born eloquence of the Arabians but their penetration was sharp their fancy luxu riant their wit strong and sententious 4 and their more elaborate compositions were addressed with energy and effect to the minds of their hearers The genius and merit of a rising poet were celebrated by the applause of his own and the kindred tribes A solemn banquet was prepared and a chorus of women striking their tym bals and displaying the pomp of their nuptials sung in the presence of their sons and husbands the felicity of their native tribe that a champion had now appeared to vindicate their rights that a herald had raised his voice to immortalize their renown The distant or hostile tribes resorted to an

their keenest satire against a despicable race they affirmed in the bitterness of reproach that the men knew not how to give nor the women to deny l The same hospitality which was practised by Abraham and celebrated by Homer is still renewed in the camps of the Arabs The ferocious Bedoweens the terror of the desert embrace without inquiry or hesitation the stranger who dares to con fide in their honour and to enter their tent His treatment is kind and respectful he shares the wealth or the poverty of his host and after a needful repose he is dismissed on his way with thanks with blessings and perhaps with gifts The heart and hand are more largely expanded by the wants of a brother or a friendj but the heroic acts that could deserve the public applause must have surpassed the narrow measure of discretion and experience A dispute had arisen who among the citizens of Mecca was entitled to the prize of generosity and a suc cessive application was made to the three who were deemed most worthy of the trial Abdallah the son of Abbas had undertaken a distant journey and his foot was in the stirrup when he heard the voice of a suppliant â O son of the uncle of the apostle of God I am a traveller and in distress He instantly dismounted to present the pilgrim with his camel her rich caparison and a purse of four thou sand pieces of gold excepting only the sword either for its intrinsic value or as the gift of an honoured kinsman The servant of Kais informed the second sup pliant that his master was asleep but he immediately added Here is a purse of seven thousand pieces of gold it is all we have in the house and here is an order that will entitle you to a camel and a slave the master as soon as he awoke praised and enfranchised his faithful steward with a gentle reproof that by re specting his slumbers he had stinted his bounty The third of these heroes the blind Arabah at the hour of prayer was supporting his steps on the shoulders of two slaves Alas he replied  my coffers are empty but these you may sell if you refuse I renounce them At these words pushing away the youths he groped along the wall with his staff The character of Hatem is the perfect model of Arabian virtue 2 he was brave and liberal an eloquent poet and a successful robber forty camels were roasted at his hospitable feast and at the prayer of a suppliant enemy he restored both the captives and the spoil The freedom of his countrymen disdained he laws of justice thqy proudly indulged the spontaneous impulse of pity and benevolence The religion of the Arabs 3 as well as of the Indians consisted in the worship of the sun the moon and the fixed stars a primitive and specious mode of super stition The bright luminaries of the skv display the visible image of a deity their number and distance convey to a philosophic or even a vulgar eye the idea of a boundless space the character of eternity is marked on these solid globes that seem incapable of corruption or decay the regularity of their motions may bfr ascribed to a principle of reason or instinct and their real or imaginary influence encourages the vain belief that the earth and its inhabitants are the object of their peculiar care The science of astronomy was cultivated at Babvlon but the school of the Arabs was a clear firmament and a naked plain In the nocturnal marches they steered by the guidance of the stars their names and order and daily station were familiar to the curiosity and devotion of the Bedoween and he was taught by experience to divide in twenty eight parts the zodiac of the moon and to bless the constellations who refreshed with salutary rains the thirst of the desert The reign of the heavenly orbs could not be extended beyond the visible sphere and some metaphysical powers were necessary to sustain the transmigration of souls and the resurrection of bodies a camel was left to perish on the grave that he might serve his master in another life and the invocation of departed

linen or silken veil which is annually renewed by the Turkish emperor was first offered by a pious king of the Homerites who reigned seven hundred years before the time of Mahomet 2 A tent or a cavern might suffice for the worship of the savages but an edifice of stone and clay has been erected in its place and the art and power of the monarchs of the east have been confined to the simplicity of the original model 5 A spacious portico encloses the quadrangle of the Caaba a square chapel twenty four cubits long twenty three broad and twenty seven high a door and a window admit the light the double roof is supported by three pillars of wood a spout now of gold discharges the rain water and the well Zanzem is protected by a dome from accidental pollution The tribe of Koreish by fraud or force had acquired the custody of the Caaba the sacerdotal office de volved through four lineal descents to the grandfather of Mahomet and the family of the Heshemites from whence he sprung was the most respectable and sacred in the eyes of their country 4 The precincts of Mecca enjoyed the rights of sanc tuary and in the last month of each year the city and the temple were crowded with a long train of pilgrims who presented their vows and offerings in the house of God The same rites which are now accomplished by the faithful Mussulman were invented and practised by the superstition of the idolaters At an awful dis tance they cast away their garments seven times with hasty steps they encircled the Caaba and kissed the black stone seven times they visited and adored the adjacent mountains seven times they threw stones into the valley of Mina and the pilgrimage was achieved as at the present hour by a sacrifice of sheep and camels and the burial of their hair and nails in the consecrated ground Each tribe either found or introduced in the Caaba their domestic worship the temple  was adorned or defiled with three hundred and sixty idols of men eagles lions and antelopes and the most conspicuous was the statue of Hebal of red agate holding in his hand seven arrows without heads or feathers the instruments and symbols of profane divination But this statue was a monument of Syrian arts the devotion of the ruder ages was content with a pillar or a tablet and the rocks of the desert were hewn into gods or altars in imitation of the black stone 5 of Mecca which is deeply tainted with the reproach of an idolatrous origin From Japan to Peru the use of sacrifice has universally prevailed and the votary has expressed his gratitude or fear by destroying or consuming in

to the climate of Mecca might be come useless or inconvenient on the banks of the Danube or the Volga Arabia was free the adjacent kingdoms were shaken by the storms of conquest and tyranny and the persecuted sects fled to the happy land where they might profess what they thought and practise what they professed The religions of the Sabians and Magians of the Jews and Christians were disseminated from the Persian gulf to the Red Sea In a remote period of antiquity Sabianism was dif fused over Asia by the science of the Chaldeans 4 and the arms of the Assyrians From the observations of two thousand years the priests and astronomers of Ba bylon 5 deduced the eternal laws of nature and Providence They adored the seven gods or angels who directed the course of the seven planets and shed their irresistible influence on the earth The attributes of the seven planets with the twelve signs of the zodiac and the twenty four constellations of the northern and southern hemisphere were represented by images and talismans the seven days of the week were dedicated to their respective deities the Sabians prayed thrice each day and the temple of the moon at Haran was the term of their pilgrimage 6 But the flexible genius of their faith was always ready either to teach or to learn in the tradition of the creation the deluge and the patriarchs they held a singular

years before the death of Mahomet the Jews were settled in Arabia and a far greater multitude was expelled from the holy land in the wars of Titus and Hadrian The industrious exiles aspired to liberty

whose grace or justice has interrupted by seasonable miracles the order of na ture The most rational of the Arabs acknowledged his power though they ne glected his worship 2 and it was habit rather

daughters and thirteen sons His best beloved Abdullah was the most beautiful and modest of the Arabian youth and in the first night when he con summated his marriage with Amina of the noble race of theZahrites two hundred virgins are said to have expired of jealousy and despair Mahomet or more pro perly Mahommed the only son of Abdallah and Amina was born at Mecca four years after the death of Justinian and two months after the defeat of the Abys sinians l whose victory would have introduced into the Caaba the religion of the Christians In his early infancy he was deprived of his father his mother and his grandfather his uncles were strong and numerous and in the division of the inheritance the orphan s share was reduced to five camels and an Ethiopian maid servant At home and abroad in peace and war Abu Taleb the most respecta ble of his uncles was the guide and guardian of his youth in his twenty fifth year he entered into the service of Cadijah a rich and noble widow of Mecca who soon rewarded his fidelity with the gift of her hand and fortune The marriage con tract in the simple style of antiquity recites the mutual loves of Mahomet and Cadijah describes him as the most accomplished of the tribe of Koreish and stipulates a dowry of twelve ounces of gold and twenty camels which was sup plied by the liberality of his uncle 2 By this alliance the son of Abdallah was restored to the station of his ancestors and the judicious matron was content with his domestic virtues till in the fortieth year of his age 3 he assumed the title of a prophet and proclaimed the religion of the Koran According to the tradition of his companions Mahomet 4 was distinguished by the beauty of his person an outward gift which is seldom despised except by those to whom it has been refused Before he spoke the orator engaged on his side the affections of a public or private audience They applauded his command ing presence his majestic aspect his piercing eye his gracious smile his flowing beard his countenance that painted every sensation of the soul and his gestures that enforced each expression of the tongue In the familiar offices of life he scrupulously adhered to the grave and ceremonious politeness of his country his respectful attention to the rich and powerful was dignified by his condescension and affability to the poorest citizens of Mecca the frankness of his manner con cealed the artifice of his views and the habits of courtesy were imputed to per sonal friendship or universal benevolence His memory was capacious and reten tive his wit easy and social his imagination sublime his judgment clear rapid and decisive He possessed the courage both of thought and action and al though his designs might gradually expand with his success the first idea which he entertained of his divine mission bears the stamp of an original and superior genius The son of Abdallah was educated in the bosom of the noblest race in the use of the purest dialect of Arabia and the fluency of his speech was cor rected and enhanced by the practice of discreet and seasonable silence With these powers of eloquence Mahomet was an illiterate barbarian his youth had never been

so rare ittnong the citizens of Mecca it was not in the cool deliberate act of a treaty that Mahomet would have dropped 316 THE DECLINfc AND FALL exempted him from shame or reproach but he was reduced to a narrow circle of existence and deprived of those faithful mirrors which reflect to our mind the minds of sages and heroes Yet the book of nature and of man was open to his view and some fancy has been indulged in the political and philosophical obser vations which are ascribed to the Arabian travelier t He compares the nations and the religions of the earth discovers the weakness of the Persian and Roman monarchies beholds with pity and indignation the degeneracy of the times and resolves to unite under one God and one king the invincible spirit and primitive virtues of the Arabs Our more accurate inquiry will suggest that instead of vi siting the courts the camps the temples of the east the two journeys of Maho met into Syria were confined to the fairs of Bostra and Damascus that he was only thirteen years of age when he accompanied the caravan of his uncle and that his duty compelled him to return as soon as he had disposed of the merchan dise of Cadijah In these hasty and superficial excursions the eye of genius might discern some objects invisible to his grosser companions some seeds of knowledge might be cast upon a fruitful soil but his ignorance of the Syriac lan guage must have checked his curiosity and I cannot perceive in the life or wri tings of Mahomet that his prospect was far extended beyond the limits of the Ara bian world From every region of that solitary world the pilgrims of Mecca were annually assembled by the calls of devotion and commerce in the free con course of multitudes a simple citizen in his native tongue might study the poli tical state and character of the tribes the theory and practice of the Jews and Christians Some useful strangers might be tempted or forced to implore the rights of hospitality and the enemies of Mahomet have named the Jew the Per sian and the Syrian monk whom they accuse of lending their secret aid to the composition of the Koran 2 Conversation enriches the understanding but soli tude is the school of genius and the uniformity of a work denotes the hand of a single artist From his earliest youth Mahomet was addicted to religious contem plation each year during the month of Ramadan he withdrew from the world and from the arms of Cadijah in the cave of Hera three miles from Mecca 3 he consulted the spirit of fraud or enthusiasm whose abode is not in the heavens but in the mind of the prophet The faith which under the name of Islam he preached to his family and nation is compounded of an eternal truth and a ne cessary fiction That there is only one God AND that Mahomet is the apostle of God It is the boast of the Jewish apologists that while the learned nations of anti quity were deluded by the fables of polytheism their simple ancestors of Pales tine preserved the knowledge and worship of the true God The moral attri butes of Jehovah may not easily be reconciled with the standard of human virtues his metaphysical qualities are darkly expressed but each page of the Pentateuch and the prophets is an evidence of his power the unity of his name is inscribed on the first table of the law and his sanctuary was never defiled by any visible image of the invisible essence After the ruin of the temple the faith of the Hebrew exiles was purified fixed and enlightened by the spiritual devotion of the synagogue and the authority of Mahomet will not justify his perpetual reproach that the Jews of Mecca or Medina adored Ezra as the son of God 4 But the children of Israel had ceased to be a people and the religions of the world were guilty at least in the eyes of the prophet of giving sons or daughters or companions to the supreme God In the rude idolatry of the Arabs the crime is manifest and audacious the Sabians arc poorly excused by the pre eminence of the first planet tlie mask nor ran any conclusion be drawn from ihe words of disease and delirium The lettered youth before he aspired to the prophetic character must have often excrcised in private life the arts of

Arabia invested the Virgin Mary with the name and honours of a goddess 1 The mysteries of the Trinity and incarnation afifiear to contradict the principle of the divine unity In their obvious sense they introduce three equal deities and transform the man Jesus into the substance of the son of God 2 an orthodox commentary will satisfy only a believing mind intemperate curiosity and zeal had torn the veil of the sanctuary and each of the oriental sects was eager to confess that all except themselves deserved the reproach of idolatry and polytheism The creed of Mahomet is free from suspicion or ambiguity and the Koran is a glorious testimony to the unity of God The prophet of Mecca rejected the worship of idols and men of stars and planets on the rational principle that whatever rises must set that what ever is born must die that whatever is corruptible must decay and perish 3 In the author of the universe his rational enthusiasm confessed and adored an infinite and eternal being without form or place without issue or similitude present to our most secret thoughts existing by the necessity of its own nature and deriving from himself all moral and intellectual perfection These sublime truths thus an nounced in the language of the prophet 4 are firmly held by his disciples and defined with metaphysical precision by the interpreters of the Koran A philoso phic theist might subscribe the popular creed of the Mahometans 5 a creed too sublime perhaps for our present faculties What object remains for the fancy or even the understanding when we have abstracted from the unknown substance all ideas of time and space of motion and matter of sensation and reflection The first principle of reason and revelation was confirmed by the voice of Mahomet his proselytes from India to Morocco are distinguished by the name of Unitarians and the danger of idolatry has been prevented by the interdiction of images The doctrine of eternal decrees and absolute predestination is strictly embraced by the Mahometans and thev struggle with the common difficulties how to reconcile the prescience of God with the freedom and responsibility of man how to explain the permission of evil under the reign of infinite power and infinite goodness The God of nature has written his existence on all his works and his law in the heart of man To restore the knowledge of the one and the practice of the other has been the real or pretended aim of the prophets of every age the libe rality of Mahomet allowed to his predecessors the same credit which he claimed for himself and the chain of inspiration was prolonged from the fall of Adam to the promulgation of the Koran 6 During that period some rays of prophetic light had been imparted to one hundred and twenty four thousand of the elect discriminated by their respective measures of virtue and grace three hundred and thirteen apostles were sent with a special commission to recall their country from idolatry and vice one hundred

on the cross and the innocent saint was translated to the seventh heaven 8 During six hundred years the gospel was the way of truth and salvation but the Christians insensibly forgot both the laws and

had indeed been despatched on the most important errands and this trusty messenger successively revealed the chapters and verses to the Arabian prophet Instead of a perpetual and perfect measure of the divine will the fragments of the Koran were produced at the discretion of Mahomet each revelation is suited to the emergencies of his policy or passion and all contradic tion is removed by the saving maxim that any text of Scripture is abrogated or modified by any subsequent passage The word of God and of the apostle was diligently recorded by his disciples on palm leaves and the shoulder bones of mut ton and the pages without order or connexion were cast into a domestic chest in the custody of one of his wives Two years after the death of Mahomet the sa cred volume was collected and

of a uniform and incorruptible text In the spirit of enthusiasm or vanity the pro Ehet rests the truth of his mission on the merit of his book audaciously challenges oth men and angels to imitate the beauties of a single page and presumes to as sert that God alone could dictate this incomparable performance 2 This argu ment is most powerfully addressed to a devout Arabian whose mind is attuned to faith and rapture whose ear is delighted by the music ef sounds and whose igno rance is incapable of comparing the productions of human genius 3 The har mony and copiousness of style will not reach in

Homer or the Philippics of Demosthenes  In all religions the life of the founder supplies the silence of his written revelation the sayings of Mahomet were so many lessons of truth his actions so many examples of virtue and the public and private memorials were preserved by his wives and companions At the end of two hundred years the Sonna or oral law was fixed and consecrated by the labours of Al

Mecca and Medina to produce a similar evidence of his divine le gation to call down from heaven the angel or the volume of his revelation to create a garden in the desert or to kindle a conflagration in the unbelieving city As often as he is pressed by the demands of the Koreish he involves himself in the obscure boast of vision and prophecy appeals to the internal proofs of his doc trine and

revolutions round the Caaba saluted Mahomet in the Arabian tongue and suddenly contracting her dimensions entered at the col lar and issued forth through the sleeve of his shirt 4 The vulgar are amused with these marvellous tales but the gravest of the Mussulman doctors imitate the modesty of their master and indulge a latitude of faith or interpretation 5 They might speciously allege that in preaching the religion it was needless to violate the harmony of nature that a creed unclouded with mystery may be ex cused from miracles and that the sword of Mahomet was not less potent than the rod of Moses The polytheist is oppressed and distracted by the variety of superstition a thousand rites of Egyptian origin were interwoven with the essence of the Mosaic law and the spirit of the gospel had evaporated in the pageantry of the church The prophet of Mecca was tempted by prejudice or policy or patriotism to sanctify the rites of the Arabians and the custom of visiting the holy stone of the Caaba But the precepts of Mahomet himself inculcate a more simple and ra tional piety prayer fasting and alms are the religious duties of a Mussulman and he is encouraged to hope that prayer will carry him half way to God fasting will bring him to the door of his palace and alms will gain him admittance 6 J 1 See more remarkably Koran c 2 6 12 13 17 Prideaux Life of Mahomet p 18 19 has

with the Deity was commanded to impose on his disciples the daily obligation of fifty prayers By the advice of Moses he applied for an alleviation of this intolerable burden the number was gradually reduced to five without any dispensation of business or pleasure or time or place the devotion of the faithful is repeated at day break at noon in the afternoon in the evening and at the first watch of the night and in the present decay of religious fervour our travellers are edified by the profound humility and attention of the Turks and Persians Cleanliness is the key of prayer the frequent lustration of the hands the face and the body which was practised of old by the Arabs is solemnly enjoined by the Koran and a permission is formally granted to supply with sand the scarcity of water The words and attitudes of supplication as it is performed either sit ting or standing or prostrate on the ground are prescribed by custom or authority but the prayer is poured forth in short and fervent ejaculations the measure of zeal is not exhausted by a tedious liturgy and each Mussulman for his own per son is invested with the character of a priest Amongst the theists who reject the use of images it has been found necessary to restrain the wanderings of the fancy by directing the eye and the thought towards a kcbla or visible point of the horizon The prophet was at first inclined to gratify the Jews by the choice of Jerusalem but he soon returned to a more natural partiality and five times every day the eyes of the nations of Astracan at Fez at Delhi are devoutly turned to the holy temple of Mecca Yet every spot for the service of God is equally pure the Mahometans indifferently pray in their chamber or in the street As a dis tinction from the Jews and Christians the Friday in each week is set apart for the useful institution of public worship the people are assembled in the mosch and the iman some respectable elder ascends the pulpit to begin the prayer and pro nounce the sermon But the Mahometan religion is destitute of priesthood or sacrifice and the independent spirit of fanaticism looks down with contempt on the ministers and the slaves of superstition II The voluntary l penance of the ascetics the torment and glory of their lives was odious to a prophet who cen sured in his companions a rash vow of abstaining from flesh and women and sleep and firmly declared that he would sutler no monks in his religion 2 Yet he in stituted in each year a fast of thirty days and strenuously recommended the ob servance as a discipline which purifies the soul and subdues the body as a salu tary exercise of obedience to the will of God and his apostle During the month of Ramadan from the rising to the setting of the sun the Mussulman abstains from eating and drinking and women and baths and perfumes from all nourish ment that can restore his strength from all pleasure that can gratify his senses In the revolution of the lunar year the Ramadan coincides by turns with the winter cold and the summer heat and the patient martyr without assuaging his thirst with a drop of water must expect the close of a tedious and sultry day The interdiction of wine peculiar to some orders of priests or hermits is converted by Mahomet alone into a positive and general law 3 and a considerable portion of the globe has abjured at his command the use of that salutary though dangerous liquor These painful restraints are doubtless infringed by the libertine and eluded by the hypocrite but the legislator by whom they are enacted cannot surely be accused of alluring his proselytes by the indulgence of their sensual ap petites III The charity of the Mahometans descends to the animal creation and the Koran repeatedly inculcates not as a merit but as a strict and indispen sable duty the relief of the indigent and unfortunate Mahomet perhaps is the only lawgiver who has defined the precise measure of charity the standard may vary with the degree and nature of property as it consists either in money in corn or cattle in fruits or merchandise but the Mussulman does not accomplish the Tournefort Voyage du Levant torn ii p 325â 360 in octavo

revenue and if his conscience accuses him of fraud or extortion the tenth under the idea of restitution is enlarged to a tfifth V Benevolence is the foundation of justice since we are forbid to injure those whom â we are bound to assist A prophet may reveal the secrets of heaven and of futu rity but in his moral precepts he can only repeat the lessons of our own hearts  The two articles of belief and the four practical duties of Islam are guarded by rewards and punishments and the faith of the Mussulman is devoutly fixed on the event of the judgment and the last day The prophet has not presumed to determine the moment of that awful catastrophe though he darkly announces the signs both in heaven and earth which will precede the universal dissolution when lite shall be destroyed and the order of creation shall be confounded in the primi tive chaos At the blast of the trumpet new worlds will start into being angels genii and men will arise from the dead and the human soul will again be united to the body The doctrine of the resurrection was first entertained by the Egyp tians and their mummies were embalmed their pyramids were constructed to preserve the ancient mansion of the soul during a period of three thousand years But the attempt is partial and unavailing and it is with a more philoso phic spirit that Mahomet relies on the omnipotence of the Creator whose word can re animate the breathless clay and collect the innumerable atoms that no longer retain their form or substance 3 The intermediate state of the soul it is hard to decide and those who most firmly believe her immaterial nature are at a loss to understand how she can think or act without the agency of the organs of sense The re union of the soul and body will be followed by the final judgment of mankind and in his copy of the Magian picture the prophet has too faithfully represented the forms of proceeding and even the slow and successive operations of an earthly tribunal By his intolerant adversaries he is upbraided for extend ing even to themselves the hope of salvation for asserting the blackest heresy that every man who believes in God and accomplishes good works may expect in the last day a favourable sentence Such rational indifference is ill adapted to the character of a fanatic nor is it probable that a messenger from heaven should de preciate the value and necessity of his own revelation In the idiom of the Ko ran the belief of God is inseparable from that of Mahomet the good works are those which he has enjoined and the two qualifications imply the profession of Islam to which all nations and all sects are equally invited Their spiritual blindness though excused by ignorance and crowned with virtue will be scourged with everlasting torments and the tears which Mahomet shed over the tomb of his mother for whom he was forbidden to pray display a striking contrast of hu manity and enthusiasm 5 The doom of the infidels is common the measure of their guilt and punishment is determined by the degree of evidence which they have rejected by the magnitude of the errors which they have entertained the eternal mansions of the Christians the Jews the Sabians the Magians and the idolaters are sunk below each other in the abyss and the lowest hell is reserved for the faithless hypocrites who have assumed the mask of religion After the greater part of mankind has been condemned for their opinions the true believers only will be judged by their actions The good and evil of each Mussulman will be accurately weighed in a real or allegorical balance and a singular mode of com pensation will be allowed for the payment of injuries the aggressor will refund an equivalent of his own good actions for the benefit of the person whom he has wronged and if he should be destitute of any moral property the weight of his sins will be loaded with an adequate share of the demerits of the sufferer According as 1 Thejealousy of Maracci Prodromus part iv p 33

over the sharp and perilous bridge of the abyss but the innocent treading in the footsteps of Mahomet will gloriously enter the gates of paradise while the guilty will falUinto the first and mildest of the seven hells The term of expiation will vary from nine hundred to seven thou sand years but the prophet has judiciously promised that all his disciples what ever may be their sins shall be saved by their own faith and his intercession from eternal damnation It is not surprising that superstition should act most power fully on the fears of her votaries since the human fancy can paint with more ener gy the misery than the bliss of a future life With the simple elements of dark ness and fire we create a sensation of pain which may be aggravated to an infi nite degree by the idea of endless duration But the same idea operates with an opposite effect on the continuity of pleasure and too much of our present enjoy ments is obtained from the relief or the comparison of evil It is natural enough that an Arabian prophet should dwell with rapture on the groves the fountains and the rivers of paradise but instead of inspiring the blessed inhabitants with a liberal taste for harmony and science conversation and friendship he idly cele brates the pearls and diamonds the robes of silk palaces of marble dishes of gold rich wines artificial dainties numerous attendants and the whole train of sensual and costly luxury which becomes insipid to the owner even in the short eriod of this mortal life Seventy two houris or black eyed girls of resplendent eauty blooming youth virgin purity and exquisite sensibility will be created for the use of the meanest believer a moment of pleasure will be prolonged to a thousand years and his faculties will be increased a hundred fold to render him worthy of his felicity Notwithstanding a vulgar prejudice the gates of heaven will be open to both sexes but Mahomet has not specified the male companions of the female elect lest he should either alarm the jealousy of their former hus bands orUisturb their felicity by the suspicion of an everlasting marriage This image of a carnal paradise has provoked the indignation perhaps the envy of the monks they declaim against the impure religion of Mahomet and his modest apologists are driven to the poor excuse of figures and allegories But the sounder and more consistent party adhere without shame to the literal interpretation of the Koran useless would be the resurrection of the body unless it were restored to the possession and exercise of its worthiest faculties and the union of sensual and intellectual enjoyment is requisite to complete the happiness of the double ani mal the perfect man Yet the joys of the Mahometan paradise will not be con fined to the indulgence of luxury and appetite and the prophet has expressly de clared that all meaner happiness will be forgotten and despised by the saints and martyrs who shall be admitted to the beatitude of the divine

and resolving to impart to his family the light of divine truth he prepared a banquet a lamb as it is said and a bowl of milk for the entertainment of forty guests of the race of Hashem  Friends and kinsmen said Mahomet to the assembly  I offer you and I alone can offer the most precious of gifts the treasures of this world and of the world to come God has commanded me to call you to his ser vice Who among you will support my burden  Who among you will be my companion and my vizir No answer was returned till the silence of asto nishment and doubt and contempt was at length broken by the impatient cou rage of Ali a youth in the fourteenth year of his age  O prophet I am the man whosoever rises against thee I will dash out his teeth tear out his eyes break his legs rip up his belly O prophet I will be thy vizir over them Ma homet accepted his offer with transport and Abu Taleb was ironically exhorted to respect the superior dignity of his son In a more serious tone the father of Ali advised his nephew to relinquish his impracticable design  Spare your re monstrances replied the intrepid fanatic to his uncle and benefactor if they  should place the sun on my right hand and the moon on my left they should not divert me from my course He persevered ten years in the exercise of his mis sion and the religion which has overspread the east and the west advanced with a slow and painful progress within the walls of Mecca Yet Mahomet enjoyed the satisfaction of beholding the increase of his infant congregation of unitarians who revered him as a prophet and to whom he seasonably dispensed the spiritual nourishment of the Koran The number of proselytes may be estimated by the absence of eighty three men and eighteen women who retired to Ethiopia in the seventh year of his mission and his party was fortified by the timely conversion of his uncle Hamza and of the fierce and inflexible Omar who signalized in the cause of Islam the same zeal which he had exerted for its destruction Nor was the charity of Mahomet confined to the tribe of Koreish or the precincts of Mec ca on solemn festivals in the days of pilgrimage he frequented the Caaba ac costed the strangers of every tribe and urged both in private converse and pub lic discourse the belief and worship of a sole deity Conscious of his reason and of his weakness he asserted the liberty of conscience and disclaimed the use of religious violence 2 but he called the Arabs to repentance and conjured them to remember the ancient idolaters of Ad and Thamund whom the divine justice had swept away from the face of the earth 3 The people of Mecca were hardened in their unbelief by superstition and envy The elders of the city the uncles of the prophet affected to despise the presump tion of an orphan the

and folly silence him quickly lest he kindle tumult and discord in the city If he persevere we shall draw our swords against him and his adherents and thou wilt be responsible for theT lood of thy fellow citizens The weight and moderation of Abu Taleb eluded the violence of religious faction the most helpless or timid of the disciples retired to Ethiopia and the prophet withdrew himself to various places of strength in the town and country As he was still supported by his family the rest of the tribe of Koreish engaged themselves to renounce all intercourse with the children of Hashem neither to buy nor sell neither to marry nor to give in marriage but to pursue them with implacable enmi ty till they should deliver the person of Mahomet to the justice of the gods The decree was suspended in the Caaba before the eyes of the nation the messengers of the Koreish pursued the the Mussulman exiles in heart of Africa they be sieged the prophet and his most faithful followers intercepted their water and inflamed their mutual animosity by the retaliation of injuries and insults A doubtful truce restored the appearances of concord till the death of Abu Taleb abandoned Mahomet to the power of his enemies at the moment when he was deprived of his domestic comforts by the loss of his faithful and generous Cadijah Abu Sophian the chief of the branch of Ommiyah succeeded to the principality of the republic of Mecca A zealous votary of the idols a mortal foe of the line of Hashem he convened an assembly of the Koreishites and their allies to decide the fate of the apostle His imprisonment might provoke the despair of his en thusiasm and the exile of an eloquent and popular fanatic would diffuse the mis chief through the provinces of Arabia His death was resolved and they agreed that a sword from each tribe should be buried in his heart to divide the guilt of his blood and baffle the vengeance of the Hashemites An angel or a spy re vealed their conspiracy and flight was the only resource of Mahomet 2 At the dead of night accompanied by his friend Abubeker he silently escaped from his house the assassins watched at the door but they were deceived by the figure of Ali who reposed on the bed and was covered with the green vestment of the apos tle The Koreish respected the piety of the heroic youth but some verses of Ali which are still extant exhibit an interesting picture of his anxiety his tenderness and his religious confidence Three days Mahomet and his companion were con cealed in the cave of Thor at the distance of a league from Mecca and in the close of each evening they received from the son and daughter of Abubeker a secret supply of intelligence and food The diligence of the Koreish explored every haunt in the neighbourhood of the city they arrived at the entrance of the cavern but the providential deceit of a spider s web and a pigeon s nest is sup posed to convince them that the place was solitary and inviolate  We are only two said the trembling Abubeker  There is a third replied the prophet  it is God himself No sooner was the pursuit abated than the two fugitives issued from the rock and mounted their camels on the road to Medina they were overtaken by the emissaries of the Koreish they redeemed themselves with prayers and promises from their hands In this eventful moment the lance of an Arab

DECLINE AND FALL city known under the name of Yathreb before it was sanctified by the throne of the prophet was divided between the tribes of the Charegites and the Awsites whose hereditary feud was rekindled by the slightest provocations two colonies of Jews who boasted a sacerdotal race were their humble allies and without converting the Arabs they introduced the taste of science and religion which dis tinguished Medina as the city of the book Some of her noblest citizens in a pil grimage to the Caaba were converted by the preaching of Mahomet on their re turn they diffused the belief of God and his prophet and the new alliance was ratified by their deputies in two secret ano nocturnal interviews on a hill in the suburbs of Mecca In the first ten Charegites and two Awsites united in faith and love protested in the name of their wives their children and their absent brethren that they would for ever profess the creed and observe the precepts of the Koran The second was a political association the first vital spark of the em pire of the Saracens 1 Seventy three men and two women of Medina held a solemn conference with Mahomet his kinsmen and his disciples and pledged themselves to each other by a mutual oath of fidelity They promised in the name of the city that if he should be banished they would receive him as a confe derate obey him as a leader and defend him to the last extremity like their wives and children  But if you are recalled by your country they asked with a flattering anxiety  will you not abandon your new allies â All things replied Mahomet with a smile are now common between us your blood is as my blood your ruin as my ruin We are bound to each other by the ties of honour and in terest I am your friend and the enemy of your foes â But if we are killed in your service what exclaimed the deputies of Medina will be our reward â Paradise replied the prophet  Stretch forth thy hand He stretched it forth and they reiterated the oath of allegiance and fidelity Their treaty was ratified by the people who unanimously embraced the profession of Islam they rejoiced in the exile of the apostle but they trembled for his safety and impa tiently expected his arrival After a perilous and rapid journey along the sea coast he halted at Koba two miles from the city and made his public entry into Medina sixteen days after his flight from Mecca Five hundred of the citizens advanced to meet him he was hailed with acclamations of loyalty and devotion Mahomet was mounted on a she camel an umbrella shaded his head and a tur ban was unfurled before him to supply the deficiency of a standard His bravest disciples who had been scattered by the storm assembled round his person and the equal though various merit of the Moslems were distinguished by the names of Moajrerians and Ansars the fugitives of Mecca and the auxiliaries of Medina To eradicate the seeds of jealousy Mahomet judiciously coupled his principal fol lowers with the rights and obligations of brethren and when AH found himself without a peer the prophet tenderly declared that he would be the companion and brother of the noble youth The expedient was crowned with success the holy fraternity was respected both in peace and war and the two parties vied with each other in a generous emulation of courage and fidelity Once only the con cord was slightly ruffled by an accidental quarrel a patriot of Medina arraigned the insolence of the strangers but the hint of their expulsion was heard with ab liorrence and his own son most eagerly offered to lay at the apostle s feet the head of his father  From his establishment at Medina Mahomet assumed the exercise of the regal and sacerdotal office and it was impious to appeal from a judge whose decrees were inspired by the divine wisdom A small portion of ground the patrimony of two orphans was acquired by gift or purchase 2 on that chosen spot he built a house and a mosch more venerable in their rude simplicity than the palaces and temples of the Assyrian caliphs His seal of gold or silver was inscribed with the apostolic title when he prayed and preached in the weekly assembly he leaned against

fifteen hundred Moslems in arms and m the field renewed their oath of allegi ance and their chief repeated the assurance of protection till the death of the last member or the final dissolution of the party It was in the same camp that the deputy of Mecca was astonished by the attention of the faithful to the words and looks of the prophet by the eagerness with which they collected his spittle a hair that dropped on the ground the refuse water of his lustrations as if they participated in some degree of the prophetic virtue  I have seen said he the Chosroes of Persia and the Csesar of Rome but never did I behold a king among his subjects like Mahomet among his companions The devout fervour of en thusiasm acts with more energy and truth than the cold and formal servility of courts In the state of nature every man has a right to defend by force of arms his per son and his possessions to repel or even to prevent the violence of his enemies and to extend his hostilities to a reasonable measure of satisfaction and retaliation In the free society of the Arabs the duties of subject and citizen imposed a fee ble restraint and Mahomet in the exercise of a peaceful and benevolent mission had been despoiled and banished by the injustice of his countrymen The choice of an independent people had exalted the fugitive of Mecca to the rank of a so vereign and he was invested with the just prerogative of forming alliances and of waging offensive or defensive war The imperfection of human rights was sup plied and armed by the plenitude of divine power the prophet of Medina assumed in his new revelations a fiercer and more sanguinary tone which proves that his former moderation was the effect of weakness 2 the means of persuasion had been tried the season of forbearance was elapsed and he was now commanded to propagate his religion by the word to destroy the monuments of idolatry and without regarding the sanctity of days or months to pursue the unbelieving nations of the earth The same bloody precepts so repeatedly inculcated in the Koran are ascribed by the author to the Pentateuch and the gospel But the mild tenor of the evangelic style may explain an ambiguous text that Jesus did not bring peace on the earth but a sword his patient and humble virtues should not be con founded with the intolerant zeal of princes and bishops who have disgraced the name of his disciples In the prosepution of religious war Mahomet might appeal with more propriety to the example of Moses of the judges and the kings of Israel The military laws of the Hebrews are still more rigid than those of the Arabian legislator 3 The Lord of hosts marched in person before the Jews if a city re sisted their summons the males without distinction were put to the sword the seven nations of Canaan were devoted to destruction and neither repentance nor conversion could shield them from the inevitable doom that no creature within their precincts should be left alive The fair option of friendship or submission or battle was proposed to the enemies of Mahomet If they professed the creed of Islam they were admitted to all the temporal and spiritual benefits of his pri mitive disciples and marched under the same banner to extend the religion which they had emhraced The clemency of the prophet was decided by his interest yet he seldom trampled on a prostrate enemy and he seems to promise that on the pay ment of a tribute the least guilty of his unbelieving subjects might be indulged in their worship or at least in their imperfect faith In the first months of his reign he practised the lessons of holy warfare and displayed his white banner before the gates of Medina the martial apostle fought in person at nine battles or sieges 4 and fifty enterprises of war were achieved in ten years by himself or his lieutenants The Arab continued to unite the professions of a merchant and a robber and his petty  excursions for the defence or the attack of a caravan insensibly prepared his

prophet for pious and charitable uses the remainder was shared in adequate portions by the soldiers who had obtained the victory or guarded the camp the rewards of the slain devolved to their widows and orphans and the increase of cavalry was encouraged by the allotment of a double share to the horse and to the man From all sides the roving Arabs were allured to the standard of religion and plunder the apostle sanctified the license of embracing the female captives as their wives or concubines and the enjoyment of wealth and beauty was a feeble type of the joys of paradise prepared for the valiant martyrs of the faith  The sword says Mahomet is the key of heaven and of hell a drop of blood shed in the cause of God a night spent in arms is of more avail than two months of fasting or prayer whosoever falls in battle his sins are forgiven at the day of judgment his wounds shall be resplendent as vermilion and odoriferous as musk and the loss of his limbs shall be supplied by the wings of angels and che rubims The intrepid souls of the Arabs were fired with enthusiasm the pic ture of the invisible world was strongly painted on their imagination and the death which they had always despised became an object of hope and desire The Koran inculcates in the most absolute sense the tenets of fate and predestination which would extinguish both industry and virtue if the actions of man were governed by his speculative belief Yet their influence in every age has exalted the courage of the Saracens and Turks The first companions of Mahomet advanced to bat tle with a fearless confidence there is no danger where there is no chance they were ordained to perish in their beds or they were safe and invulnerable amidst the darts of the enemy 2 Perhaps the Koreish would have been content with the flight of Mahomet had they not been provoked and alarmed by the vengeance of an enemy who could intercept their Syrian trade as it passed and repassed through the territory of Me dina Abu Sophian himself with only thirty or forty followers conducted a weal thy caravan of a thousand camels the fortune or dexterity of his march escaped the vigilance of Mahomet but the chief of the Koreish was informed that the holy robbers were placed in ambush to wait his return He despatched a messen ger to his brethren of Mecca and they were roused by the fear of losing their merchandise and their provisions unless they hastened to his relief with the mi litary force of the city The sacred band of Mahomet was formed of three hun dred and thirteen Moslems of whom seventy seven were fugitives and the rest auxiliaries they mounted by turns a train of seventy camels the camels of Yath reb were formidable in war but such was the poverty of his first disciples that only two could appear on horseback in the field 3 In the fertile and famous vale of Beder 4 three stations from Medina he was informed by his scouts of the ca ravan that approached on one side of the Koreish one

were punished with death and the ransom of the others four thousand drachms of silver compensated in some degree the escape of the caravan But it was in vain that the camels of Abu Sophian explored a new road through the desert and along the Euphrates they were overtaken by the diligence of the Mussulmans and wealthy must have been the prize if twen ty thousand drachms could be set apart for the fifth of the apostle The resent ment of the public and private loss stimulated Abu Sophian to collect a body of three thousand men seven hundred of whom were armed with cuirasses and two hundred were mounted on horseback three thousand camels attended his march and his wife Henda with fifteen matrons of Mecca incessantly sounded their tym brels to animate the troops and to magnify the greatness of Hobal the most popu lar deity of the Caaba The standard of God and Mahomet was upheld by nine hundred and fifty believers the disproportion of numbers was not more alarm ing than in the field of Beder and their presumption of victory prevailed against the divine and human sense of the apostle The second battle was fought on mount Ohud six miles to the north of Medina 2 the Koreish advanced in the form of a crescent and the right wing of cavalry was led by Caled the fiercest and most successful of the Arabian warriors The troops of Mahomet were skilfully posted on the declivity of the hill and their rear was guarded by a detachment of fifty archers The weight of their charge impelled and broke the centre of the ido laters but in the pursuit they lost the advantage of their ground the archers de serted their station the Mussulmans were tempted by the spoil disobeyed their general and disordered their ranks The intrepid Caled wheeling his cavalry on their flank and rear exclaimed with a loud voice that Mahomet was slain He was indeed wounded in the face with a javelin two of his teeth were shattered with a stone yet in the midst of tumult and dismay he reproached the infidels with the murder of a prophet and blessed the friendly hand that staunched his blood and conveyed him to a place of safety Seventy martyrs died for the sins of the people they fell said the apostle in pairs each brother embraced his life less companion 3 their bodies were mangled by the inhuman females of Mecca and the wife of Abu Sophian tasted the entrails of Hamza the uncle of Mahomet They might applaud their superstition and satiate their fury but the Mussulmans soon rallied in the field and the Koreish wanted strength or courage to undertake the siege of Medina It was attacked the ensuing year by an army of ten thou sand enemies and this third expedition is variously named from the nations which marched under the banner of Abu Sophian from the ditch which was drawn be fore the city and a camp of three thousand Mussulmans The prudence of Ma homet declined a general engagement the valour of Ali was signalized in single combat and the war was protracted twenty days till the final separation of the confederates A tempest of wind rain and hail overturned their tents the private quarrels were fomented by an insidious adversary and the Koreish deserted by their allies no longer hoped to subvert the throne or to check the conquests of their invincible exile 4 The choice of Jerusalem for the first kebla of prayer discovers the early pro pensity of Mahomet in favour of the Jews

to the last moment of his life and in the double character of an apostle and a conqueror his perse cution was extended to both worlds l The Kainoka dwelt at Medina under the protection of the city he seized the occasion of an accidental tumult and sum moned them to embrace his religion or contend with him in battle  Mas re plied the trembling Jews we are ignorant of the use of arms but we persevere in the faith and worship of our fathers why wilt thou reduce us to the necessity of a just defence The unequal conflict was terminated in fifteen days audit was with extreme reluctance that Mahomet yielded to the importunity of his al lies and consented to spare the lives of the captives But their riches were con fiscated their arms became more effectual in the hands of the Mussulmans and a wretched colony of seven hundred exiles was driven with their wives and chil dren to implore a refuge on the confines of Syria The Nadharites were more guilty since they conspired in a friendly interview to assassinate the prophet He besieged their castle three miles from Medina but their resolute defence obtained an honourable capitulation and the garrison sounding their trumpets and beating their drums was permitted to depart with the honours of war The Jews had excited and joined the war of the Koreish no sooner had the nations retired from the ditch than Mahomet without laying aside his armour marched on the same day to extirpate the hostile race of the children of Koraidha After a resistance of twenty five days they surrendered at discretion They trusted to the intercession of their old allies of Medina they could not be ignorant that fanaticism obliterates the feelings of humanity A venerable elder to whose judgment they appealed pronounced the sentence of their death seven hundred Jews were dragged in chains to the market place of the city they descended alive into the grave pre pared for their execution and burial and the apostle beheld with an inflexible eye the slaughter of his helpless enemies Their sheep and camels were inherited by the Mussulmans three hundred cuirasses five hundred pikes a thousand lances composed the most useful portion of the spoil Six days journey to the north east of Medina the ancient and wealthy town of Chaibar was the seat of the Jew ish power of Arabia the territory a fertile spot in the desert was covered with plantations and cattle and protected by eight castles some of which were esteemed of impregnable strength The forces of Mahomet consisted of two hundred horse and fourteen hundred foot in the succession of eight regular and painful sieges they were exposed to danger and fatigue and hunger and the most undaunted chiefs despaired of the event The apostle revived their faith and courage by the example of Ali on whom he bestowed the surname of the Lion of God perhaps we may believe that a Hebrew champion of gigantic size was cloven to the chest by his irresistible scimitar but we cannot praise the modesty of romance which represents him as tearing from its hinges the gate of a fortress and wielding the ponderous buckler in his left hand 2 After the reduction of the castles the town of Chaibar submitted to the yoke The chief of the tribe was tortured in the pre sence of Mahomet to force a confession of his hidden treasure the industry of the shepherds and husbandmen was rewarded with a precarious toleration they were permitted so long as it should please the conqueror to improve their patri mony in equal shares for Ms emolument and their own Under the reign of Omar the Jews of Chaibar were transplanted to Syria and the caliph alleged the injunction of his dying master that one and the true religion should be pro fessed in his native land of Arabia 3 Five times each day the eyes of Mahomet were turned towards Mecca 4 and he was urged by the most sacred and powerful motives to revisit as a conqueror the city and temple from whence he had been driven as an

the Koreish and their allies a truce of ten years engaged to restore the fugitives of Mecca who should embrace his religion and stipulated only for the ensuing year the humble privilege of entering the city as a friend and of remain ing three days to accomplish the rites of the pilgrimage A cloud of shame and sorrow hung on the retreat of the Mussulmans and their disappointment might justly accuse the failure of a prophet who had so often appealed to the evidence of success The faith and hope of the pilgrims were rekindled by the prospect of Mecca their swords were sheathed seven times in the footsteps of the apostle they encompassed the Caaba the Koreish had retired to the hills and Mahomet after the customary sacrifice evacuated the city on the fourth day The people were edified by his devotion the hostile chiefs were awed or divided or seduced and both Caled and Amrou the future conquerors of Syria and Egvpt most sea sonably deserted the sinking cause of idolatry The power of Mahomet was in creased by the submission of the Arabian tribes ten thousand soldiers were as sembled for the conquest of Mecca and the idolaters the weaker part were easi ly convicted of violating the truce Enthusiasm and discipline impelled the march and preserved the secret till the blaze of ten thousand fires proclaimed to the astonished Koreish the design the approach and the irresistible force of the enemy The haughty Abu Sophian presented the keys of the city admired the variety of arms and ensigns that passed before him in review observed that the son of Abdallah had acquired a mighty kingdom and confessed under the scimitar of Omar that he was the apostle of the true God The return of Marius and Svlla was stained with the blood of the Romans the revenge of Mahomet was stimulated by religious zeal and his injured followers were eager to execute or to prevent the order of a massacre Instead of indulging their passions and his own l the victorious exile forgave the guilt and united the factions of Mecca His troops in three divisions marched into the city eight and twenty of the inhabi tants were slain by the sword of Caled eleven men and six women were pro scribed by the sentence of Mahomet but he blamed the cruelty of his lieutenant and several of the most obnoxious victims were indebted for their lives to his cle mency or contempt The chiefs of the Koreish were prostrate at his feet  What mercy can you expect from the man whom you have wronged â We confide in the generosity of our kinsman â And you shall not confide in vain begone you are safe you are free The people of Mecca deserved their pardon by the pro fession of Islam and after an exile of seven years the fugitive missionary was en throned as the prince and prophet of his native country 2 But the three hun dred and sixty idols of the Caaba were ignominiously broken the house of God was purified and adorned as an example to future times the apostle again fulfilled the duties

pagans advanced with secrecy and speed to surprise the conqueror they pitied and despised the su pine negligence of the Koreish but they depended on the wishes and perhaps the aid of a people who had so lately renounced their gods and bowed beneath the yoke of their enemy The banners of Medina and Mecca were displayed by the prophet a crowd of Bedoweens increased the strength or numbers of the army and twelve thousand Mussulmans entertained a rash and sinful presumption of their invincible strength They descended without precaution into the valley of Honain the heights had been occupied by the archers and slingers of the confede rates their numbers were oppressed their discipline was confounded their cou rage was appalled and the Koreish smiled at their impending destruction The prophet

three of these fell dead at his feet O my brethren he repeatedly cried with sorrow and indignation I am the son of Abdallah I am the apostle of truth O man stand fast jn the faith O God send down thy succour His uncle Abbas who like the heroes of Ho mer excelled in the loudness of his voice made the valley resound with the re cital of the gifts and promises of God the flying Moslems returned from all sides to the holy standard and Mahomet observed with pleasure that the furnace was again rekindled his conduct and example restored the battle and he animated his victorious troops to inflict a merciless revenge on the authors of their shame From the field of Honain he marched without delay to the siege of Tayef sixty miles to the south east of Mecca a fortress of strength whose fertile lands pro duce the fruits of Syria in the midst of the Arabian desert A friendly tribe in structed I know not how in the art of sieges supplied him with a train of bat tering rams and military engines with a body of five hundred artificers But it was in vain that he offered freedom to the slaves of Tayef that he violated his own laws by the extirpation of the fruit trees that the ground was opened by the miners that the breach was assaulted by the troops After a siege of twenty days the prophet sounded a retreat but he retreated with a song of devout tri umph and affected to pray for the repentance of the unbelieving city The spoil of this fortunate expedition amounted to six thousand captives twenty four thou sand camels forty thousand sheep and four thousand ounces of silver a tribe who had fought at Honain redeemed their prisoners by the sacrifice of their idols but Mahomet compensated the loss by resigning to the soldiers his fifth of the plun der and wished for their sake that he possessed as many head of cattle as there were trees in the province of Tehama Instead of chastising the disaffection of the Koreish he endeavoured to cut out their tongues his own expression and to secure their attachment by a superior measure of liberality Abu Sophian alone was presented with three hundred camels and twenty ounces of silver and Mecca was sincerely converted to the profitable

Medina were as numerous says the Arabian proverb as the dates that fall from the maturity of a palm tree The nation submitted to the God and the sceptre of Mahomet the opprobrious name of tribute was abolished the spontaneous or reluctant obla tions of alms and tithes were applied to the service of religion and one hun dred and fourteen thousand Moslems accompanied the last pilgrimage of the apostle 1 When Heraclius returned in triumph from the Persian war he entertained at Erhesa one of the ambassadors of Mahomet who invited the princes and na tions of the earth to the profession of Islam On this foundation the zeal of the Arabians has supposed the secret conversion of the Christian emperor the vanity of the Greeks has feigned a personal visit to the prince of Medina who accepted from the royal bounty a rich domain and a secure retreat in the province of Sy ria But the friendship of Heraclius and Mahomet were of short continuance the new religion had inflamed rather than assuaged the rapacious spirit of the Sa racens and the murder of an envoy afforded a decent pretence for invading with three thousand soldiers the territory of Palestine that extends to the eastward of the Jordan The holy banner was intrusted to Zeid and such was the discipline or enthusiasm of the rising sect that the noblest chiefs served without reluctance under the slave of the prophet On the event of his decease Jaafar and Abdal lah were successively substituted to the command and if the three should pe rish in the war the troops were authorized to elect their general The three leaders

To his Christian subjects Mahomet readily granted the security of their persons the freedom of their trade the property of their goods and the toleration of their worship l The weakness of their Arabian brethren had restrained them from opposing his ambition the disciples of Jeslfe were endeared to the enemy of the Jews and it was the interest of a conqueror to propose a fair capitulation to

between self illusion and voluntary fraud Charity may believe that the original motives of Mahomet were those of pure and genuine benevolence but a human missionary is incapable of cherishing the obstinate unbelievers who reject his claims despise his arguments and persecute liis life he might forgive his personal adversaries he may lawfully hate the enemies of God the stern passions of pride and revenge were kindled in the bosom of Mahomet and he sighed like the prophet of Nineveh for the destruction of the rebels whom he had condemned The injustice of Mecca and the choice of Medina transformed the citizen into a prince the humble preacher into the leader of armies but his sword was consecrated by the example of the saints and the same God who af flicts a sinful world with pestilence and earthquakes might inspire for their con version or chastisement the valour of his servants In the exercise of political government he was compelled to abate of the stern rigour of fanaticism to com ply in some measure with the prejudices and passions of his followers and to employ even the vices of mankind as the instruments of their salvation The use of fraud and perfidy of cruelty and injustice were often subservient to the propa gation of the faith and Mahomet commanded or approved the assassination of the Jews and idolaters who had escaped from the field of battle By the repeti tion of such acts the character of Mahomet must have been gradually stained  and the influence of such pernicious habits would be poorly compensated by the practice of the personal and social virtues which are necessary to maintain the reputation of a prophet among his sectaries and friends Of his last years ambi tion was the ruling passion and a politician will suspect that he secretly smiled the victorious impostor at the enthusiasm of his youth and the credulity of his proselytes 1 A philosopher would observe that their cruelty and his success â would tend more strongly to fortify the assurance of his divine mission that his interest and religion were inseparably connected and that his conscience would be soothed by the persuasion that he alone was absolved by the Deity from the obligation of positive and moral laws If he retained any vestige of his native in nocence the sins of Mahomet may be allowed as the evidence of his sincerity In the support of truth the arts of fraud and fiction may be deemed less crimi nal and he would have started at the foulness of the means had he not been sa tisfied of the importance and justice of the end Even in a conqueror or a priest I can surprise a word or action of unaffected humanity and the decree of Maho met that in the sale of captives the mother should never be separated from her children may suspend or moderate the censure of the historian 2 The good sense of Mahomet 3 despised the pomp of royalty the apostle of God submitted t o the menial offices of the family he kindled the fire swept the floor milked the ewes and mended with his own hands his shoes and his woollen garment Disdaining the penance and merit of a hermit he observed without ef fort or vanity the abstemious diet of an Arab and a soldier On solemn occasions he feasted his companions with rustic and hospitable plenty but in his domestic life many weeks would elapse without a fire being kindled on the hearth of the prophet The interdiction of wine was confirmed by his example his hunger was appeased with a sparing allowance of barley bread he delighted in the taste of milk and honey but his ordinary food consisted of dates and water Perfumes and women were the two sensual enjoyments which his nature required and his re ligion did not forbid and Mahomet affirmed that the fervour of his devotion was increased by these innocent pleasures The heat of the climate inflames the blood of the Arabs and their libidinous complexion has been noticed by the writers of antiquity 4 Their incontinence was regulated by the civil and religious laws of the Koran their incestuous alliances were blamed the boundless license of poly gamy was reduced to four legitimate wives or concubines their rights both of bed and of dowry were

fornication in either sex was punished with a hundred stripes l Such were the calm and rational precepts of the legislator but in his private conduct Mahomet indulged the appetites of a man and abused the claims of a prophet A special revelation dispensed him from the laws which he had imposed on his nation the female sex without re serve was abandoned to his desires and this singular prerogative excited the envy rather than the scandal the veneration rather than the envy of the devout Mussulmans If we remember the seven hundred wives and three hundred con cubines of the wise Solomon we shall applaud the modesty of the Arabian who espoused no more than seventeen or fifteen wives eleven are enumerated who occupied at Medina their separate apartments round the house of the apostle and enjoyed in their turns the favour of his conjugal society What is singular enough they were all widows excepting only Ayesha the daughter of Abubeker She was doubtless a virgin since Mahomet consummated his nuptials such is the pre mature ripeness of the climate when she was only nine years of age The youth the beauty the spirit of Ayesha gave her a superior ascendant she was beloved and trusted by the prophet and after his death the daughter of Abubeker was long revered as the mother of the faithful Her behaviour had been ambiguous and indiscreet in a nocturnal march she was accidentally left behind and in the morning Ayesha returned to the camp with a man The temper of Mahomet was inclined to jealousy but a divine revelation assured him of her innocence he chas tised her accusers and published a law of domestic peace that no woman should be condemned unless four male witnesses had seen her in the act of adultery 2 In his adventures with Zeineb the wife of Zeid and with Mary an Egyptian captive the amorous prophet forgot the interest of his reputation At the house of Zeid his freedman and adopted son he beheld in a loose undress the beauty of Zeineb and burst forth into an ejaculation of devotion and desire The servile or grateful freedman understood the hint and yielded without hesitation to the love of his benefactor But as the filial relation had excited some doubt and scan dal the angel Gabriel descended from heaven to ratify the deed to annul the adoption and gently to reprove the apostle for distrusting the indulgence of his God One of his wives Hafna the daughter of Omar surprised him on her own bed in the embraces of his Egyptian captive she promised secrecy and for giveness he swore that he would renounce the possession of Mary Both parties forgot their engagements and Gabriel again descended with a chapter of the Ko ran to absolve him from his oath and to exhort him freely to enjoy his captives and concubines without listening to the clamours of his wives In a solitary re treat of thirty days he laboured alone with Mary to fulfil the commands of the angel When his love and revenge were satiated he summoned to his presence his eleven wives reproached their disobedience and indiscretion and threatened them with a sentence of divorce both in this world and the next a dreadful sen tence since those who had ascended the bed of the prophet were for ever excluded from the hope of a second marriage Perhaps the incontinence of Mahomet may be palliated by the tradition of his natural or preternatural gift 3 he united the manly virtue of thirty of the children of Adam and the apostle might rival the thirteenth labour 4 of the Grecian Hercules 5 A more serious and decent ex cuse may be drawn from his fidelity to Cadijah During the twenty four years of their marriage her youthful husband abstained from the right of polygamy and the pride or tenderness of the venerable matron was never insulted by the society of a

was poor and persecuted by the world 1 In the largest indulgence of polygamy the founder of a religion and empire might aspire to multiply the chances of a numerous posterity and a lineal succes sion The hopes of Mahomet were fatally disappointed The virgin Ayesha and his ten widows of mature age and approved fertility were barren in his potent embraces The four sons of Cadijah died in their infancy Mary his Egyptian concubine was endeared to him by the birth of Ibrahim At the end of fifteen months the prophet wept over his grave but he sustained with firmness the rail lery of his enemies and checked the adulation or credulity of the Moslems by the assurance that an eclipse of the sun was not occasioned by the death of the infant Cadijah had likewise given him four daughters who were married to the most faithful of his disciples the three eldest died before their father but Fatima who possessed his confidence and love became the wife of her cousin Ali and the mother of an illustrious progeny The merit and misfortunes of Ali and his de scendants will lead me to anticipate in this place the series of the Saracen ca liphs a title which describes the commanders of the faithful as the vicars and suc cessors of the apostle of God 2 The birth the alliance the character of Ali which exalted him above the rest of his countrymen might justify his claim to the vacant throne of Arabia The son of Abu Taleb was in his own right the chief of the family of Hashem and the hereditary prince or guardian of the city and temple of Mecca The light of prophecy was extinct but the husband of Fatima might expect the inheritance and blessing of her father the Arabs had sometimes been patient of a female reign and the two grandsons of the prophet had often been fondled in his lap and shown in his pulpit as the hope of his age and the chief of the youth of para dise The first of the true believers might aspire to march before them in this world and in the next and if some were of a graver and more rigid cast the zeal and virtue of Ali were never outstripped by any recent proselyte He united the qualifications of a poet a soldier and a saint his wisdom still breathes in a collec tion of moral and religious sayings 3 and every antagonist in the combats of the tongue or of the sword was subdued by his eloquence and valour From the first hour of his mission to the last rites of his funeral the apostle was never forsaken by a generous friend whom he delighted to name his brother his vicegerent and the faithful Aaron of a second Moses The son of Abu Taleb was afterward re proached for neglecting to secure his interest by a solemn declaration of his right which would have silenced all competition and sealed his succession by the de crees of heaven But the unsuspecting hero confided in himself the jealousy of empire and perhaps the fear of opposition might suspend the resolutions of Ma homet and the bed of sickness was besieged by the artful Ayesha the daughter of Abubeker and the enemy of Ali The silence and death of the prophet restored the liberty of the people and his companions convened an assembly to deliberate on the choice of a successor The hereditary claim and lofty spirit of Ali were offensive to an aristocracy of elders desirous of bestowing and resuming the sceptre by a free and frequent election the Koreish could never be reconciled to the proud pre eminence of the line of Hashem the ancient discord of the tribes was rekindled the fugitives of Mecca and the auxiliaries of Medina asserted their respective merits and the rash pro

disinte rested resolution of Omar who suddenly renouncing his own pretensions stretched forth his hand and declared himself the first subject of the mild and venerable Abubeker The urgency of the moment and the acquiescence of the people might excuse this illegal and precipitate measure but Omar himself confessed from the pulpit that if any Mussulman should hereafter presume to anticipate the suffrage of his brethren both the elector and the elected would be worthy of death 1 After the simple inauguration of Abubeker he was obeyed in Medina Mecca and the provinces of Arabia the Hashemites alone declined the oath of fidelity and their chief in his own house maintained above six months a sullen and independent reserve without listening to the threats of Omar whoattempted to consume with fire the habitation of the daughter of the apostle The death of Fatima and the decline of his party subdued the indignant spirit of Ali he con descended to salute the commander of the faithful accepted his excuse of the ne cessity of preventing their common enemies and wisely rejected his courteous of fer of abdicating the government of the Arabians After a reign of two years the aged caliph was summoned by the angel of death In his testament with the tacit approbation of the companions he bequeathed the sceptre to the firm and intrepid virtue of Omar I have no occasion said the modest candidate  for the place â But the place has occasion for you replied Abubeker who ex pired with a fervent prayer that the god of Mahomet would ratify his choice and  direct the Mussulmans in the way of concord and obedience The prayer was not ineffectual since Ali himself in a life of privacy and prayer professed to revere the superior worth and dignity of his rival who comforted him for the loss of em pire by the most flattering marks of confidence and esteem In the twelfth year of his reign Omar received a mortal wound from the hand of an assassin he re jected with equal impartiality the names of his son and of Ali refused to load his conscience with the sins of his successor and devolved on six of the most respec table companions the arduous task of electing a commander of the faithful On this occasion Ali was again blamed by his friends 2 for submitting his right to the judgment of men for recognising their jurisdiction by accepting a place among the six electors He might have obtained their suffrage had he deigned to pro mise a strict and servile conformity not only to the Koran and tradition but like wise to the determinations of two seniors 3 With these limitations Othman the secretary of Mahomet accepted the government nor was it till after the third caliph twenty four years after the death of the prophet that Ali was invested by the popular choice with the regal and sacerdotal office The manners of the Arabians retained their primitive simplicity and the son of Abu Taleb despised the pomp and vanity of this world At the hour of prayer he repaired to the mosch of Medina clothed in a thin cotton gown a coarse turban on his head his slippers in one hand and his bow in the other instead of a walking staff The companions of the prophet and the chiefs of the tribes saluted their new sove reign and gave him their right hands as a sign of fealty and allegiance The mischiefs that flow from the contests of ambition are usually confined to the times and countries in which they had been agitated But the religious discord of the friends and enemies of Ali has been renewed in every age of the Hegira and is still maintained in the immortal hatred of the Persians and Turks 4 The former who are branded with the appellation of Shiites or sectaries have enriched the Mahometan creed with a new article of faith and if Mahomet be the apostle his companion Ali is the vicar of God In their private converse in their public worship they bitterly execrate the three usurpers who intercepted his indefeasi ble right to the dignity of imam and caliph and the name of Omar expresses in 1 Ockley Ilist of the Saracens vol i p 5 6 from an Arabian MS represents Ayesba as averse to the substitution of her father in the place of the apostle This

the husband of Fatima in the persuasion that the order of succession was de termined by the degrees of sanctity 2 An historian who balances the four caliphs with a hand unshaken by superstition will calmly pronounce that their manners were alike pure and exemplary that their zeal was fervent and probably sincere and that in the midst of riches and power their lives were devoted to the prac tice of moral and religious duties But the public virtues of Abubeker and Omar the prudence of the first the severity of the second maintained the peace and prosperity of their reigns The feeble temper and declining age of Othman were incapable of sustaining the weight of conquest and empire He chose and he was deceived he trusted and he was betrayed the most deserving of the faith ful became useless or hostile to his government and his lavish bounty was produc tive only of ingratitude and discontent The spirit of discord went forth in the provinces their deputies assembled at Medina and the Charegites the desperate fanatics who disclaimed the yoke of subordination atid reason were confounded among the free born Arabs who demanded the redress of their wrongs and the punishment of their oppressors From Cufa from Bassora from Egypt from the tribes of the desert they rose in arms encamped about a league from Medina and despatched a haughty mandate to their sovereign requiring him to execute justice or to descend from the throne His repentance began to disarm and dis perse the insurgents but their fury was rekindled by the arts of his enemies and the forgery of a perfidious secretary was contrived to blast his reputation and pre cipitate his fall The caliph had lost the only guard of his predecessors the es teem and confidence of the Moslems during a siege of six weeks his water and provisions were intercepted and the feeble gates of the palace were protected only by the scruples of the more timorous rebels Forsaken by those who had abused his simplicity the helpless and venerable caliph expected the approach of death the brother of Ayesha marched at the head of the assassins and Othman with the Koran in his lap was pierced with a multitude of wounds A tumultuous anar chy of five days was appeased by the inauguration of Ali his refusal would have provoked a general massacre In this painful situation he supported the becoming pride of the chief of the Hashemites declared that he had rather serve than reign rebuked the presumption of the strangers and required the formal if not the vo luntary assent of the chiefs of the nation He has never been accused of pro moting the assassin of Omar though Persia indiscreetly celebrates the festival of that holy martyr The quarrel between Othman and his subjects was assuaged by the early mediation of Ali and Hassan the eldest of his sons was insulted and wounded in the defence of the caliph Yet it is doubtful whether the father of Hassan was strenuous and sincere in his opposition to the rebels and it is cer tain that he enjoyed the benefit of their crime The temptation was indeed of such magnitude as might stagger and corrupt the most obdurate virtue The am bitious candidate no longer aspired to the barren sceptre of Arabia the Saracens had been victorious in the east and west and the wealthy kingdoms of Persia Sy ria and Egypt were the patrimony of the commander of the faithful A life of prayer and contemplation had not chilled the martial activity of Ali but in a mature age after a long experience of mankind he still betrayed in his conduct the rashness and indiscretion of youth In the first days of his youth he neglected to secure either by gifts or fetters the doubtful allegiance of Telha and Zobier two of the most powerful of the Arabian chiefs They escaped from Me dina to Mecca and from thence to Bassora erected the standard of revolt and usurped the government of Irak or Assyria which they had vainly solicited as the reward of their services The mask of patriotism is allowed to cover the mo glaring inconsistencies and the enemies perhaps the assassins of Othman ni demanded vengeance for his blood They were accompanied in their flight 1 Omar ii the name of the

that the mother of the faithful should ex pose in a camp her person and character but the superstitious crowd was confi dent that her presence would sanctify the justice and assure the success of their cause At the head of twenty thousand of his loyal Arabs and nine thousand va liant auxiliaries of Cufa the caliph encountered and defeated the superior num ber of the rebels under the walls of Bassora Their leaders Telha and Zobier were slain in the first battle that stained with civil blood the arms of the Moslems After passing through the ranks to animate the troops Ayesha had taken her post amidst the dangers of the field In the heat of the action seventy men who held the bridle of her camel were successively killed or wounded and the cage or lit ter in which she sat was struck with javelins and darts like the quills of a porcu pine The venerable captive sustained with firmness the reproaches of the con queror and was speedily dismissed to her proper station at the tomb of Mahomet with the respect and tenderness that was still due to the widow of the apostle Af ter this victory which was styled the Day of the Camel Ali marched against a more formidable adversary against Moawiyah the son of Abu Sophian who had assumed the title of caliph and whose claim was supported by the forces of Syria and the interest of the house of Ommiyah From the passage of Thapsacus the plain of Siffin l extends along the western banks of the Euphrates On this spa cious and level theatre the two competitors waged a desultory war of one hun dred and ten days In the course of ninety actions or skirmishes the loss of Ali was estimated at twenty five that of Moawiyah at forty five thousand soldiers and the list of the slain was dignified with the names of five and twenty veterans who had fought at Beder under the standard of Mahomet In this sanguinary con test the lawful caliph displayed a superior character of valour and humanity His troops were strictly enjoined to await the first onset of the enemy to spare their flying brethren and to respect the bodies of the dead and the chastity of the fe male captives He generously proposed to save the blood of the Moslems by a single combat but his trembling rival declined the challenge as a sentence of ine vitable death The ranks of the Syrians were broken by the charge of a hero who was mounted on a piebald horse and wielded with irresistible force his pon derous and two edged sword As often as he smote a rebel he shouted the Allah Acbar â God is victorious and in the tumult of a nocturnal battle he was heard to repeat four hundred times that tremendous exclamation The prince of Damascus already meditated his flight but the certain victory was snatched from the grasp of Ali by the disobedience and enthusiasm of his troops Their con science was awed by the solemn appeal to the books of the Koran which Moa wiyah exposed on the foremost lances and Ali was compelled to yield to a dis graceful truce and an insidious compromise He retreated with sorrow and in dignation to Cufa his party was discouraged the distant provinces of Persia of Yemen and of Egypt were subdued or seduced by his crafty rival and the stroke of fanaticism which was aimed against the three chiefs of the nation was fatal only to the cousin of Mahomet In the temple of Mecca three Charegites or enthu siasts discoursed of the disorders of The church and state they soon agreed that the deaths of Ali of Moawiyah and of his friend Amrou the viceroy of Egypt would restore the peace and unity of religion Each of the assassins chose his victim poisoned his dagger devoted his life and secretly repaired to the scene of action Their resolution was equally desperate but the first mistook the person of Amrou and stabbed the deputy who occupied his seat the prince of Damascus was dangerously hurt by the second the lawful caliph in the mosch of Cufa re ceived a mortal wound from the hand of the third He expired in the sixty third year of his age and mercifully recommended to his children that they would des patch the murderer by a single stroke The sepulchre of Ali 2 was concealed from the tyrants of the house of

FALL a tomb a temple a city arose near the ruins of Cufa l Many thousands of the Schiites repose in holy ground at the feet of the vicar of God and the desert is vivified by the numerous and annual visits of the Persians who esteem their devo tion not less meritorious than the pilgrimage to Mecca The persecutors of Mahomet usurped the inheritance of his children and the champions of idolatry became the supreme heads of his religion and empire The opposition of Abu Sophian had been fierce and obstinate his conversion was tar dy and reluctant his new faith was fortified by necessity and interest he served he fought perhaps he believed and the sins of the time of ignorance were expia ted by the recent merits of the family of Ommiyah Moawiyah the son of Abu Sophian and of the cruel Henda was dignified in his early youth with the title or office of secretary of the prophet the judgment of Omar intrusted him with the government of Syria and he administered that important province above forty years either in a subordinate or supreme rank Without renouncing the fame of valour and liberality he affected the reputation of humanity and moderation a grateful people was attached to their benefactor and the victorious Moslems were enriched with the spoils of Cyprus and Rhodes The sacred duty of pursuing the assassins of Othman was the engine and pretence of his ambition The bloody shirt of the martyr was exposed in the mosch of Damascus the emir deplored the fate of his injured kinsman and sixty thousand Syrians were engaged in his service by an oath of fidelity and revenge Amrou the conqueror of Egypt himself and army was the first who saluted the new monarch and divulged the dangerous se cret that the Arabian caliphs might be created elsewhere more than in the city of the prophet 2 The policy of Moawiyah eluded the valour of his rival and after the death of Ali he negotiated the abdication of his son Hassan whose mind was either above or below the government of the world and who retired without a sigh from the palace of Cufa to an humble cell near the tomb of his grandfather The aspiring wishes of the caliph were finally crowned by the important change of an elective to an hereditary kingdom Some murmurs of freedom or fanaticism attested the reluctance of the Arabs and four citizens of Medina refused the oath of fidelity but the designs of Moawiyah were conducted with vigour and address and his son Yezid a feeble and dissolute youth was proclaimed as the comman der of the faithful and the successor of the apostle of God A familiar story is related of the benevolence of one of the sons of Ali In serving at table a slave had inadvertently dropped a dish of scalding broth on his master the heedless wretch fell prostrate to deprecate his punishment and re peated a verse of the Koran  Paradise is for those who command their anger â I am not angry â And for those who pardon offences â I pardon your offence â And for those who return good for evilâ I give you your liberty and four hun dred pieces of silver With an equal measure of piety Hosein the younger brother of Hassan inherited a remnant of his father s spirit and served with ho nour against the Christians in the siege of Constantinople The primogeniture of the line of Hashem and the holy character of grandson of the apostle had cen tred in his person and he was at liberty to prosecute his claim against Yezid the tyrant of Damascus whose vices he despisei and whose title he had never deigned to acknowledge A list was secretly transmitted from Cufa to Medina of one hundred and forty thousand Moslems who professed their attachment to his cause and who were eager to draw their swords as soon as he should appear on the banks of the Euphrates Against the advice of his wisest friends he resolved to trust his person and family in the hands of a perfidious people He traversed the desert of Arabia with a timorous retinue of women and children but as he ap proached the confines of Irak he was alarmed by the solitary or hostile face of the country and suspected either the defection or ruin of his party His fears were just Obeidollah the governor of Cufa had extinguished the first sparks of an insurrection and Hosein in the plain of Kerbela was encompassed by a body of five thousand horse who intercepted his communication with the city and the river He might still have escaped to a fortress in the desert that had defied the power of Cicsar and Chosroes and confided in the fidelity of the tribe of Tai which would have armed ten thousand warriors in his defence In a conference 1 The city of Meshed Ali five or sis miles from llie ruins of Cufa and one hundred and twenty to the south of Bagdad isof thesizeand form of the modern

in a frontier garrison against the Turks or safely conducted to the presence of Yezid But the commands of the caliph or his lieutenant were stern and absolute and Ho sein was informed that he must either submit as a captive and a criminal to the commander of the faithful or expect the consequences of his rebellion  Do you think replied he  to terrify me with death And during the short re â spite of a night he prepared with cairn and solemn resignation to encounter his fate He checked the lamentations of his sister Fatima who deplored the im pending ruin of his house Our trust said Hosein is in God alone All things both in heaven and earth must perish and return to their Creator My brother my father my mother were better than me and every Mussulman has an example in the prophet He pressed his friends to consult their safety by a timely flight they unanimously refused to desert or survive their beloved master and their courage was fortified by a fervent prayer and the assurance of paradise On the morning of the fatal day he mounted on horseback with his sword in one hand and the Koran in the other his generous band of martyrs consisted only of thirty two horse and forty foot but their flanks and rear were secured by the tent ropes and by a deep trench which they had filled with lighted fagots ac cording to the practice of the Arabs The enemy advanced with reluctance and one of their chiefs deserted with thirty followers to claim the partnership of in evitable death In every close onset or single combat the despair of the Fati mites was invincible but the surrounding multitude galled them from a distance with a cloud of arrows and the horses and men were successively slain a truce was allowed on both sides for the hour of prayer and the battle at length expired by the death of the last of the companions of Hosein Alone weary and wound ed he seated himself at the door of his tent As he tasted a drop of water he was pierced in the mouth with a dart and his son and nephew two beautiful youths were killed in his arms He lifted his hands to heaven they were full of blood and he uttered a funeral prayer for the living and the dead In a trans port of despair his sister issued from the tent and adjured the general of the Cu fians that he would not suffer Hosein to be murdered before his eyes a tear trickled down his venerable beard and the boldest of his soldiers fell back on every side as the dying hero threw himself among them The remorseless Sha mer a name detested by the faithful reproached their cowardice and the grand son of Mahomet was slain with three and thirty strokes of lances and swords After they had trampled on his body they carried his head to the castle of Cufa and the inhuman Obeidollah struck him on the mouth with a cane  Alas ex claimed an aged Mussulman  on these lips have I seen the lips of the apostle of God In a distant age and climate the tragic scene of the death of Hosein will awaken the sympathy of the coldest reader 1 On the annual festival of his martyrdom in the devout pilgrimage to his sepulchre his Persian votaries aban don their souls to the religious frenzy of sorrow and indignation 2 When the sisters and children of Ali were brought in chains to the throne of Damascus the caliph was advised to extirpate the enmity of a popular and hos tile race whom he had injured beyond the hope of reconciliation But Yezid preferred the counsels of mercy and the mourning family was honourably dis missed to mingle their tears with their kindred at Medina The glory of mar tyrdom superseded the right of primogeniture and the twelve imams 3 or pon tiffs of the Persian creed are Ali Hassen Hosein and the lineal descendants of Hosein to the ninth generation Without arms or treasures or subjects they successively enjoyed the veneration of the people and provoked the jealousy of the reigning caliphs their tombs at Mecca or Medina on the banks of the Eu phrates or in the province of Chorasan

two or three centuries the posterity of Abbas the uncle of Mahomet had multiplied to the number of thirty three thousand 2 the race of Ali might be equally prolific the meanest individual was above the first and greatest of princes and the most eminent were supposed to excel the perfection of angels But their adverse fortune and the wide extent of the Mussulman empire allowed an ample scope for

mily of three hundred persons the pure and orthodox branch of the caliph Has san is preserved without taint or suspicion in the holy cities of Mecca and Medi na and still retains after the revolutions of twelve centuries the custody of the temple and the sovereignty of their native land The fame and merit of Maho met would ennoble a plebeian race and the ancient blood of the Koreish tran scends the recent majesty of the kings of the earth 5 The talents of Mahomet are entitled to our applause but his success has perhaps too strongly attracted our admiration Are we surprised that a multitude of pro selytes should embrace the doctrine and the passions of an eloquent fanatic In the heresies of the church the same seduction has been tried and repeated from the time of the apostles to that of the reformers Does it seem incredible that a private citizen should grasp the sword and the sceptre subdue his native country and erect a monarchy by his victorious arms In the moving picture of the dy nasties of the east a hundred fortunate usurpers have arisen from a baser origin surmounted more formidable obstacles and filled a larger scope of empire and con quest Mahomet was alike instructed to preach and to fight and the union of these opposite qualities while it enhanced his merit contributed to his success the ope ration of force and persuasion of enthusiasm and fear continually acted on each other till every barrier yielded to their irresistible power His voice invited the Arabs to freedom and victory to arms and rapine to the indulgence of their dar ling passions in this world and the other the restraints which he imposed were re quisite to establish the credit of the prophet and to exercise the obedience of the people and the only objection to his success was his rational creed of the unity and perfections of God It is not the propagation but the permanency of his re ligion that deserves our wonder the same pure and perfect impression which he engraved at Mecca and

Christian apostles St Peter or St Paul could return to the Vatican they might possibly inquire the name of the deity who is worshipped with such myste rious rites in that magnificent temple at Oxford or Geneva they would expe rience less surprise but it might still be incumbent on them to peruse the cate chism of the church and to study the orthodox commentators on their own writings and the words of their master But the Turkish dome of St Sophia with an increase of splendour and size represents the humble tabernacle erected at Medina by the hands of Mahomet The Mahometans have uniformly withstood the temptations of reducing the object of their faith and devotion to a level with the senses and imaginations of man I believe in one God and Mahomet the apostle of God is the simple and invariable profession of Islam The intel lectual image of the Deity has never been degraded by any visible idol the ho nours of the prophet have never transgressed the measure of human virtue and his living precepts have restrained the gratitude of his disciples within the bounds of reason and religion The votaries of AH have indeed consecrated the memory of their hero his wife and his children and some of the Persian doctors pretend that the divine essence was incarnate in the person of the Imams but their super stition is universally condemned by the Sonnites and their impiety has afforded a seasonable warning against the worship of saints and martyrs The metaphysical questions on the attributes of God and the liberty of man have been agitated in the schools of the Mahometans as well as in those of the Christians but among the former they have never engaged the passions of the people or disturbed the tran quillity of the state The cause of this important difference may be found in the separation or union of the regal and sacerdotal characters It was the interest of the caliphs the successors of the prophet and commanders of the faithful to re press and discourage all religious innovations the order the discipline the tem poral and spiritual ambition of the clergy are unknown to the Moslems and the sages of the law are the guides of their conscience and the oracles of their faith From the Atlantic to the Ganges the Koran is acknowledged as the fundamental code not only of theology but of civil and criminal jurisprudence and the laws which regulate the actions and the property of mankind are guarded by the in fallible and immutable sanction of the will of God This religious servitude is at tended with some practical disadvantage the illiterate legislator had been oftea misled by his own prejudices and those of his country and the institutions of the Arabian desert may be ill adapted to the wealth and numbers pf Ispahan and Con stantinople On these occasions the cadhi respectfully places on his head the holy volume and substitutes a dexterous interpretation more opposite to the principles of equity and the manners and policy of the times His beneficial or pernicious influence on the public happiness is the last conside ration in the character of Mahomet The most bitter or most bigoted of his Chris tian or Jewish foes will surely allow that he assumed a false commission to incul cate a salutary doctrine less perfect only than their own He piously supposed as the basis of his religion the truth and sanctity of their prior revelations the virtues and miracles of their founders The idols of Arabia were broken before the throne of God the blood of human victims was expiated by prayer and fast ing and alms the laudable or innocent arts of devotion and his rewards and pun ishments of a future life were painted by the images most congenial to an ignorant or carnal generation Mahomet was perhaps incapable of dictating a moral and political system for the use of his countrymen but he breathed among the faithful a spirit of charity and friendship recommended the practice of the social virtues and checked by his laws and precepts the thirst of revenge and the oppression of widows and orphans The hostile tribes were united in faith and obedience and the valour which had been idly spent in domestic quarrels was vigorously di rected against a foreign enemy Had the impulse been less powerful Arabia free at home and formidable abroad might have flourished under a succession of her native monarchs Her sovereignty was lost by the extent and rapidity of conquest The colonies of the nation were scattered over the east and west and their blood was mingled with the blood of their converts and captives After the reign of three caliphs the throne was transported from Medina to the valley of Damascus and the banks of the Tigris the holy cities were violated by impious war Arabia was ruled by the rod of a subject perhaps of a stranger and

Christians Sic under their government The revolution of Arabia had not changed the character of the Arabs the death of Mahomet was the signal of independence and the hasty structure of his_ power and religion tottered to its foundations A small and faithful band of his primitive disciples had listened to his eloquence and shared his distress had fled with the apostle from the persecution of Mecca or had received the fugitive in the walls of Medina The increasing myriads who acknowledged Mahomet as their king and prophet had been compelled by his arms or allured by his prosperity The po lytheists were confounded by the simple idea of a solitary and invisible God the pride of the Christians and Jews disdained the yoke of a mortal and cotemporary legislator Their habits of faith and obedience were not sufficiently confirmed and many of the new converts regretted the venerable antiquity of the law of Mo ses or the rites and mysteries of the catholic church or the idols the sacrifices the joyous festivals of their pagan ancestors The jarring interests and heredi tary feuds of the Arabian tribes had not yet coalesced in a system of union and subordination and the barbarians were impatient of the mildest and most salutary laws that curbed their passions or violated their customs They submitted with reluctance to the religious precepts of the Koran the abstinence from wine the fast of the Ramadan and the daily repetition of five prayers and the alms and tithes which were collected for the treasury of Medina could be distinguished only by a name from the payment of a perpetual and ignominious tribute The example of Mahomet had excited a spirit of fanaticism or imposture and several of his rivals presumed to imitate the conduct and defy the authority of the living prophet At the head of the fugitives and auxiliaries the first caliph was reduced to the cities of Mecca Medina and Tayef and perhaps the Koreish would have restored the idols of the Caaba if their levity had not been checked by a seasona ble reproof  Ye men of Mecca will ye be the last to embrace and the first to abandon the religion of Islam  After exhorting the Moslems to confide in the aid of God and his apostle Abubeker resolved by a vigorous attack to prevent the junction of the rebels The women and children were safely lodged in the cavi ties of the mountains the warriors marching under eleven banners diffused the terror of their arms and the appearance of military force revived and confirmed the loyalty of the faithful The inconstant tribes accepted with humble repent ance the duties of prayer and fasting and alms and after some examples of success and severity the most daring apostates fell prostrate before the sword of the Lord and of Caled In the fertile province of Yamanah l between the Red Sea and the gulf of Persia in a city not inferior to Medina itself a powerful chief his name was Moseilama had assumed the character of a prophet and the tribe of Hanifa listened to his voice A female prophetess was attracted by his reputa tion the decencies of words and actions were spurned by these favourites of hea ven 2 and they employed several

was answered by Mahomet with contempt but the rapid progress of the impostor awakened the fears of his successor forty thousand Moslems were assembled un der the standard of Caled and the existence of their faith was resigned to the event of a decisive battle In the first action they were repulsed with the loss of twelve hundred men but the skill and perseverance of their general prevailed their defeat was avenged by the slaughter of ten thousand infidels and Moseilama himself was pierced by an Ethiopian slave with the same javelin which had mor tally wounded the uncle of Mahomet The various rebels of Arabia without a chief or cause were speedily suppressed by the power and discipline of the rising monarchy and the whole nation again professed and more steadfastly held the religion of the Koran The ambition of the caliphs provided an immediate exer cise for the restless spirit of the Saracens their valour was united in the prosecu tion of a holy war and their enthusiasm was equally confirmed by opposition and victory From the rapid conquests of the Saracens a presumption will naturally arise that the first caliphs commanded in person the armies of the faithful and sought the crown of martyrdom in the foremost ranks of the battle The courage of Abubeker 2 Omar 3 and Othman 4 had indeed been tried in the persecution and wars ot the prophet and the personal assurance of paradise must have taught them to despise the pleasures and dangers of the present world But they as cended the throne in a venerable or mature age and esteemed the domestic cares of religion and justice the most important duties of a sovereign Except the pre sence of Omar at the siege of Jerusalem the longest expeditions were the fre quent pilgrimage from Medina to Mecca and they calmly received the tidings of victory as they prayed or preached before the sepulchre of the prophet The austere and frugal measure of their lives was the effect of virtue or habit and the pride of their simplicity insulted the vain magnificence of the kings of the earth When Abubeker assumed the office of caliph he enjoined his daughter Ayesha to take a strict account of his private patrimony that it might be evident whether he were enriched or impoverished by the service of the state He thought him self entitled to a stipend of three pieces of gold with the sufficient maintenance of a single camel and a black slave but on the Friday of each week he distri buted the residue of his own and the public money first to the most worthy and then to the most indigent of the Moslems The remains of his wealth a coarse garment and five pieces of gold were delivered to his successor who lamented with a modest sigh his own inability to equal such an admirable model Yet the abstinence and humanity of Omar were not inferior to the virtues of Abubeker his food consisted of barley bread or dates his drink was water he preached in a gown that was torn or tattered in twelve places and a Persian satrap who paid his homage to the conqueror found him asleep among the beggars on the steps of the mosch of Medina Economy is the source of liberality and the increase of the revenue enabled Omar to establish a just and perpetual reward for the past and present services of the faithful Careless of his own emolument he assigned to Abbas the uncle of the prophet the first and most ample allowance of twenty five thousand drachms or pieces of silver Five thousand were allotted to each of the aged warriors the relics of the field of Beder and the last and meanest of the companions of Mahomet was distinguished by the annual reVard of three thousand pieces One thousand was the stipend of the veterans who had fought in the first battles against the Greeks and Persians and the decreasing pay as low as fifty pieces of silver was adapted to the respective merit and seniority of the soldiers of Omar Under his reign and that of his predecessor the conquerors of the east were the trusty servants of God and the people the mass of the pub lic treasure was consecrated to the expenses of peace and war a prudent mixture of justice and bounty maintained the discipline of the Saracens and they

heroic courage of Ali f tnt consummate prudence of Moawiyah 2 excited the emulation of their subjects and the talents which had been exercised in the school of civil discord were more usefully applied to propagate the faith and dominion of the prophet In the sloth and vanity of the palace of Damascus the succeeding princes of the house of Ommiyah were alike destitute of the qualifications of statesmen and of saints 3 Yet the spoils of unknown nations were continually laid at the foot of their throne and the uniform ascent of the Arabian greatness must be ascribed to the spirit of the nation rather than the abilities of their chiefs A large deduction must be al lowed for the weakness of their enemies The birth of Mahomet was fortunately placed in the most degenerate and disorderly period of the Persians the Romans and the barbarians of Europe the empires of Trajan or even of Constantine or Charlemagne would have repelled the assault of the naked Saracens and the torrent of fanaticism might have been obscurely lost in the sands of Arabia In the victorious days of the Roman republic it had been the aim of the senate to confine their consuls and legions to a single war and completely to suppress a first enemy before they provoked the hostilities of a second These timid max ims of policy were disdained by the magnanimity or enthusiasm of the Arabian caliphs With the same vigour and success they invaded the successors of Au gustus and those of Artaxerxes and the rival monarchies at the same instant be came the prey of an enemy whom they had been so long accustomed to despise In the ten years of the administration of Omar the Saracens reduced to his obe dience thirty six thousand cities or castles destroyed four thousand churches or temples of the unbelievers and edified fourteen hundred moschs for the exercise of the religion of Mahomet One hundred years after his flight from Mecca the arms and the reign of his successors extended from India to the Atlantic

unknown to the Asiatics l they are ignorant of the laws of criticism and oui monkish chronicles of the same period may be compared to their most popular works which are never verified by the spirit of philosophy and freedom The oriental library of a Frenchman 2 would instruct the most learned mufti of the east and perhaps the Arabs might not find in a single historian so clear and com prehensive a narrative of their own exploits as that which will be deduced in the ensuing sheets I In the first year of the first caliph his lieutenant Caled the sword of God and the scourge of the infidels advanced to the banks of the Euphrates and re duced the cities of Anbar and Hira Westward of the ruins of Babylon a tribe of sedentary Arabs had fixed themselves on the verge of the desert and Hira was the seat of a race of kings who had embraced the Christian religion and reigned above six hundred years under the shadow of the throne of Persia 3 The last of the Mondars was defeated and slain by Caled his son was sent a captive to Me dina his nobles bowed before the successor of the prophet the people were tempted by the example and success of their countrymen and the caliph accepted as the first fruits of foreign conquest an annual tribute of seventy thousand pieces of gold The conquerors and even their historians were astonished by the dawn of their future greatness In the same year says Elmacin Caled fought many signal battles an immense multitude of the infidels were slaughtered and spoils infinite and innumerable were acquired by the victorious Moslems 4 But the invincible Caled was soon transferred to the Syrian war the invasion of the Persian frontier was conducted by less active or less prudent commanders the Saracens were repulsed with loss in the passage of the Euphrates and though they chastised the insolent pursuit of the Magians their remaining forces still ho vered in the desert of Babylon The indignation and fears of the Persians suspended for a moment their intes tine divisions By the unanimous sentence of the priests and nobles their queen Arzema was deposed the sixth of the transient usurpers who had arisen and va nished in three or four years since the death of Chosroes and the retreat of He raclius Her tiara was placed on the head of Vezdegerd the grandson of Chos roes and the same era which coincides with an astronomical period 5 has re corded the fall of the Sassanian dynasty and the religion of Zoroaster 6 The youth and inexperience of the prince he was only fifteen years of age declined a peri lous encounter the royal standard was delivered into the hands of his general Rustam and a remnant of thirty thousand regular troops was swelled in truth or in opinion to one hundred and twenty thousand subjects or allies of the great king The Moslems whose numbers were re enforced from twelve to thirty thousand had pitched their camp in the plains of Cadesia 7 and their line Cregorio Abulpharagio interprete Edviardo Pocorkio in

7 Cadesia says the Nubian geographer p 121 is in roargine solitudinis sixty one leagues from Bagdad THE DECLINE AND FALL though it consisted of fewer men could produce more soldiers than the unwieldy host of the infidels I shall here observe what I must often repeat that the charge of the Arabs was not like that of the Greeks and Romans the effort of a firm and compact infantry their military force was chiefly formed of cavalry and archers and the engagement which was often interrupted and often renewed by single combats and flying skirmishes might be protracted without any decisive event to the continuance of several days The periods of the battle of Cadesia were distinguished by their peculiar appellations The first from the well timed appearance of six thousand of the Syrian brethren was denominated the day of succour The day of concussion might express the disorder of one or perhaps of both of the contending armies The third a nocturnal tumult received the whimsical name of the night of barking from the discordant clamours which were compared to the inarticulate sounds of the fiercest animals The morning of the succeeding day determined the fate of Persia and a seasonable whirlwind drove a cloud of dust against the faces of the unbelievers The clangour of arms was re echoed to the tent of Rustam who far unlike the ancient hero of his name was gently reclining in a cool and tranquil shade amidst the baggage of his camp and the train of mules that were laden with gold and silver On the sound of danger he started from his couch but his flight was overtaken by a valiant Arab who caught him by the foot struck off his head hoisted it on a lance and instantly returning to the field of battle carried slaughter and dismay among the thickest ranks of the Persians The Saracens confess a loss of seven thousand five hundred men and the battle of Cadesia is justly described by the epithets of obsti nate and atrocious 1 The standard of the monarchy was overthrown and cap tured in the field â a leathern apron of a blacksmith who in ancie it times had arisen the deliverer of Persia but this badge of heroic poverty was disguised and almost concealed by a profusion of precious gems 2 After this victory the wealthy province of Irak or Assyria submitted to the caliph and his conquests were firmly established by the speedy foundation of Bassora 3 a place which ever commands the trade and navigation of the Persians At the distance of fourscore miles from the gulf the Euphrates and Tigris unite in a broad and di rect current which is aptly stated the river of the Arabs In the midway be tween the junction and the mouth of these famous streams the new settlement was planted on the western bank the first colony was composed of eight hundred Moslems but the influence of the situation soon reared a flourishing and populous capital The air though excessively hot is pure and healthy the meadows are filled with palm trees and cattle and one of the adjacent valleys has been cele brated among the four paradises or gardens of Asia Under the first caliphs the jurisdiction of this Arabian colony extended over the southern provinces of Persia the city has been sanctified by the tombs of the companions and martyrs and the vessels of Europe still frequent the port of Bassora as a convenient sta tion and passage of the Indian trade After the defeat of Cadesia a country intersected by rivers and canals might have opposed an insuperable barrier to the victorious cavalry and the walls of Ctesiphon or Madayn which had resisted the battering rams of the Romans would not have yielded to the darts of the Saracens But the flying Persians were overcome by the belief that the last day of their religion and empire was at hand the strongest posts were abandoned by treachery or cowardice and the king with a part of his family and treasures escaped to Holwan at the foot of the Median hills In the third month after the battle Said the lieutenant of Omar passed the Tigris without opposition the capital was taken by assault and the disorderly resistance of the people gave a keener edge to the sabres of the Moslems who shouted with religious transport â This is the white palace of Chosroes this is the promise of the apostle of Clod The naked robbers of the desert were sud denly enriched beyond the measure of their hope or

untold and almost infinite mass by the fabulous computation of three thousands of thousands of thousands of pieces of gold l Some minute though curious facts represent the contrast of riches and ignorance From the remote islands of the Indian ocean a large provision of camphire 2 had been imported which is employed with a mixture of wax to illuminate the palaces of the east  Strangers to the name and properties of that odoriferous gum the Saracens mistaking it for salt mingled the camphire in their bread and were astonished at the bitterness of the taste One of the apartments of the palace was decorated with a carpet of silk sixty cubits in length and as many in breadth a paradise or garden was depic tured on the ground the flowers fruits and shrubs were imitated by the figures of the gold embroidery and the colours of the precious stones and the ample square was encircled by a variegated and verdant border The Arabian general persuaded his soldiers to relinquish their claim in the reasonable hope that the eyes of the caliph would be delighted with the splendid workmanship of nature and industry Regardless of the merit of art and the pomp of royalty the rigid Omar divided the priie among his brethren of Medina the picture was destroyed but such was the intrinsic value of the materials that the share of Ali alone was sold for twenty thousand drachms A mule that carried away the tiara and cui rass the belt and bracelets of Chosroes was overtaken by the pursuers the gor geous trophy was presented to the commander of the faithful and the gravest of the companions condescended to smile when they beheld the white beard hairy arms and uncouth figure of the veteran who was invested with the spoils of the great king 3 The sack of Ctesiphon was followed by its desertion and gradual decay The Saracens disliked the air and situation of the place and Omar was advised by his general to remove the seat of government to the western side of the Euphrates In every age the foundation and ruin of the Assyrian cities has been easy and rapid the country is destitute of stone and timber and the most so lid structures 4 are composed of bricks baked in the sun and joined by a cement of the native bitumen The name of Cufa 5 describes a habitation of reeds and earth but the importance of the new capital was supported by the numbers wealth and spirit of a colony of veterans and their licentiousness was indulged by the wisest caliphs who were apprehensive of provoking the revolt of a hun dred thousand swords Ye men of Cufa said Ali who solicited their aid  you

religion and country and the decisive battle of Nehavend was styled by the Arabs the victory of victo ries If it be true that the flying general of the Persians was stopped and over taken in a crowd of mules and camels laden with honey the incident however slight or singular will denote the luxurious impediments of an oriental army 6 The geography of Persia is darkly delineated by the Greeks and Latins but the most illustrious of her cities appear to be more ancient than the invasion of the Arabs By the reduction of Hamadan and Ispahan of Caswin Tauris and Rei they gradually approached the

the faithful who had already lost sight of the northern bear and had almost transcended the bounds of the habitable world 1 Again turning towards the west and the Roman empire they repassed the Tigris over the bridge of Mosul and in the captive provinces of Armenia and Mesopotamia embraced their victorious brethren of the Syrian army From the palace of Madayn their eastern progress was not less rapid or extensive They advanced along the Tigris and the gulf penetrated through the passes of the mountains into the valley of Estachar or Persepolis and profaned the last sanc tuary of the Magian empire The grandson of Chosroes was nearly surprised among the falling columns and mutilated figures a sad emblem of the past and present fortune of Persia 2 he fled with accelerated haste over the desert of Kir man implored the aid of the warlike Segestans and sought an humble refuge on the verge of the Turkish and Chinese power But a victorious army is insensible of fatigue the Arabs divided their forces in the pursuit of a timorous enemy and the caliph Othman promised the government of Chorasan to the first general who should enter that large and populous country the kingdom of the ancient Bac trians The condition was accepted the prize was deserved the standard of Ma homet was planted on the walls of Herat Merou and Balch and the successful leader neither halted nor reposed till his foaming cavalry had tasted the waters of the Oxus In the public anarchy the independent governors of the cities and castles obtained their separate capitulations the terms were granted or imposed by the esteem the prudence or the compassion of the victors and a simple pro fession of faith established the distinction between a brother and a slave After a noble defence Harmozan the prince or satrap of Ahwaz and Susa was com pelled to surrender his person and his state to the discretion of the caliph and their interview exhibits a portrait of the Arabian manners In the presence and by the command of Omar the gay barbarian was despoiled of his silken robes em broidered with gold and of his tiara bedecked with rubies and emeralds  Are rau now sensible said the conqueror to his naked captive are you now sensi le of the judgment of God and of the different rewards of infidelity and obedi  ence  Alas replied Harmozan  I feel them too deeply In the days of our common ignorance we fought with the weapons of the flesh and my nation was superior God was then neuter since he has espoused your quarrel you have subverted our kingdom and religion Oppressed by this painful dialogue the Persian complained of intolerable thirst but discovered some apprehensions lest he should be killed whilst he was drinking a cup of water  Be of good courage said the caliph  your life is safe till you have drank this water the crafty satrap accepted the assurance and instantly dashed the vase against the ground Omar would have avenged the deceit but his companions represented the sanctity of an oath and the speedy conversion of Harmozan entitled him not only to a free pardon but even to a stipend of two thousand pieces of gold The administration of Persia was regulated by an actual survey of the people the cattle and the fruits of the earth 3 and this monument which attests the vigilance of the ca liphs might have instructed the philosophers of every age 4 The flight of Yezdegerd had carried him beyond the Oxus and as far as the Jaxavtes two rivers S of ancient and modern renown which descend from the mountains of India towards the Caspian sea He was hospitably

prosperity and peace and his dominion was acknowledged by forty four hordes of the barbarians of Tartary His last garrisons of Cashgar and Khoten maintained a frequent in tercourse with their neighbours of the Jaxartes and Oxus a recent colony of Per sians had introduced into China the astronomy of the Magi and Taitsong might be alarmed by the rapid progress and dangerous vicinity of the Arabs I he in fluence and perhaps the supplies of China revived the hopes of Yezdegerd and the zeal of the worshippers of fire and he returned with an army of Turks to conquer the inheritance of his fathers The fortunate Moslems without un sheathing their swords were the spectators of his ruin and death The grandson of Chosroes was betrayed by his servant insulted by the seditious inhabitants of Merou and oppressed defeated and pursued by his barbarian allies He reached the banks of a river and offered his rings and bracelets for an instant passage in a miller s boat Ignorant or insensible of royal distress the rustic replied that four drachms of silver were the daily profit of his mill and that he would not sus pend his work unless the loss were repaid In this moment of hesitation and de lay the last of the Sassanian kings was overtaken and slaughtered by the Turkish cavalry in the nineteenth year of his unhappy reign 3 His son Firuz an hum ble client of the Chinese emperor accepted the station of captain of his guards and the Magian worship was long preserved by a colony of loyal exiles in the pro vince of Bucharia His grandson inherited the regal name but after a faint and fruitless enterprise he returned to China and ended his days in the palace of Si gan The male line of the Sassanides was extinct but the female captives the daughters of Persia were given to the conquerors in servitude or marriage and the race of the caliphs and imams was ennobled by the blood of their royal mo thers 4 After the fall of the Persian kingdom the river Oxus divided the territories of the Saracens and of the Turks This narrow boundary was soon overleaped by the spirit of the Arabs the governors of Chorasan extended their successive in roads and one of their triumphs was adorned with the buskin of a Turkish queen which she dropped in her precipitate flight beyond the hills of Bochara 5 But the final conquest of Transoxiana 6 as well as of Spain was reserved for

No sooner had Abubeker restored the unity of faith and government than he despatched a circular letter to the Arabian tribes â In the name of the most merciful God to the rest of the true believers Health and happiness and the mercy and blessing of God be upon you I praise the most high God and I pray for his prophet Mahomet This is to acquaint you that I intend to send the true believers into Syria 2 to take it out of the hands of the infidels And I would have you know that the fighting for religion is an act of obedience to God His messengers returned with the tidings of pious and martial ardour which they had kindled in every province and the camp of Medina was suc cessively filled with the intrepid bands of the Saracens who panted for action complained of the heat of the season and the scarcity of provisions and accused with impatient murmurs the delays of the caliph As soon as their numbers were complete Abubeker ascended the hill reviewed the men the horses and the arms and poured forth a fervent prayer for the success of their undertaking In person and on foot he accompanied the first day s march and when the blush ing leaders attempted to dismount the caliph removed their scruples by a decla ration that those who rode and those who walked in the service of religion were equally meritorious His instructions 3 to the chiefs of the Syrian army were inspired by the warlike fanaticism which advances to seize and affects to despise the objects of worldly ambition  Remember said the successor of the prophet that you are always in the presence of God on the verge of death in the assu rance of judgment and the hope of paradise Avoid injustice and oppression consult with your brethren and study to preserve the love and confidence of your troops When you fight the battles of the Lord acquit yourselves like men without turning your backs but let not your victory be stained with the blood of women or children Destroy no palm trees nor burn any fields of corn Cut

might be the choice of the prince the sword of God was both in fact and fame the foremost leader of the Saracens He obeyed without reluctance he was consulted without jealousy and such was the spirit of the man or rather of the times that Caled professed his readiness to serve under the banner of the faith though it were in the hands of a child or an enemy Glory and riches and dominion were indeed promised to the victorious Mussulman but he was care fully instructed that if the goods of this life were his only incitement they like wise would be his only reward One of the fifteen provinces of Syria the cultivated lands to the eastward of the Jordan had been decorated by Roman vanity with the name of Arabiai Y and the first arms of the Saracens were justified by the semblance of a national right The country was enriched by the various benefits of trade by the vigi lance of the emperors it was covered with a line of forts and the populous cities of Gerasa Philadelphia and Bosra 2 were secure at least from a surprise by the solid structure of their walls The last of these cities was the eighteenth station of Medina the road was familiar to the caravans of Hejaz and Irak who annually visited this plenteous market of the province and the desert the per petual jealousy of the Arabs had trained the inhabitants to arms and twelve thousand horse could sally from the gates of Bosra an appellation which signi fies in the Syriac language a strong tower of defence Encouraged by their first success against the open towns and flying parties of the borders a detachment of four thousand Moslems presumed to summon and attack the fortress of Bosra They were oppressed by the numbers of the Syrians they were saved by the presence of Caled with fifteen hundred horse he blamed the enterprise restored the battle and rescued his friend the venerable Serjabil who had vainly invoked the unity of God and the promise of the apostle After a short repose the Mos lems performed their ablutions with sand instead of water 3 ana the morning prayer was recited by Caled before they mounted on horseback Confident of their strength the people of Bosra threw open their gates drew their forces into the plain and swore to die in the defence of their religion But a religion of peace was incapable of withstanding the fanatic ciy of Fight fightl Paradise paradise that re echoed in the ranks of the Saracens and the uproar of the town the ringing of bells 4 and the exclamations of the priests and monks in creased the dismay and disorder of the Christians With the loss of two hundred

recommended an early sub mission  despised by the people and degraded from his office he still retained the desire and opportunity of revenge In a nocturnal interview he informed the enemy of a subterraneous passage from his house under the wall of the city the son of the caliph with a hundred volunteers were committed to the faith of this new ally and their successful intrepidity gave an

conquest of Bosra four days journey from Damascus 1 encouraged the Arabs to besiege the ancient capital of Syria 2 At some distance from the walls they encamped among the groves and fountains of that delicious territory 3 and the usual option of the Mahometan faith of tribute or of war was proposed to the resolute citizens who had been lately strengthened by a re enforcement of five thousand Greeks In the decline as in the infancy of the military art a hos tile defiance was frequently offered and accepted by the generals themselves 4 many a lance was shivered in the plain of Damascus and the personal prowess of Caled was signalized in the first sally of the besieged After an obstinate combat he had overthrown and made prisoner one of the Christian leaders a stout and worthy antagonist He instantly mounted a fresh horse the gift of the governor of Palmyra and pushed forwards to the front of battle  Repose yourself for a moment said his friend Derar  and permit me to supply your place you are fatigued with fighting with this dog â O Derar replied the indefatigable Sara cen  we shall rest in the world to come He that labours to day shall rest to mor row With the same unabated ardour Caled answered encountered and van quished a second champion and the heads of his two captives who refused to abandon their religion were indignantly hurled into the midst of the city The event of some general and partial actions reduced the Damascenes to a closer de fence but a messenger whom they dropped from the walls returned with the promise of speedy and powerful succour and their tumultuous joy conveyed the intelligence to the camp of the Arabs After some debate it was resolved by the generals to raise or rather to suspend the siege of Damascus till they had given battle to the forces of the emperor In the retreat Caled would have chosen the more perilous station of the rear guard he modestly yielded to the wishes of Abu Obeidah But in the hour of danger he flew to the rescue of his companion who was rudely pressed by a sally of six thousand horse and ten thousand foot and few among the Christians could relate at Damascus the circumstances of their defeat The importance of the contest required the junction of the Saracens who were dispersed on the frontiers of Syria and Palestine and I shall transcribe one of the circular mandates which was addressed to Amrou the future conqueror of Egypt  In the name of the most merciful God from Caled to Amrou health and happiness Know that thy brethren the Moslems design to march to Aizna din where there is an army of seventy thousand Greeks who propose to come against us that they may extinguish the light of God with their mouths but God preserveth his light in spite of the infidels 5 As soon therefore as this let ter of mine shall be delivered to thy hands come with those that are with thee to Aiznadin where thou shalt find us if it please the most high God The sum mons was cheerfully obeyed and the forty five thousand Moslems who met on the same day on the same spot ascribed to the blessing of Providence the effects of their activity and zeal About four years after the triumphs of the Persian war the repose of Heraclius and the empire was again disturbed by a new enemy the power of whose religion was more strongly felt than it was clearly understood by the Christians of the east 1 Damascus

Constantinople or Antioch he was awakened by the invasion of Syria the loss of Bosra and the danger of Damascus An army of seventy thou sand veterans or new levies was assembled at Hems or Emesa under the com mand of his general Werdan l and these troops consisting chiefly of cavalry might be indifferently styled either Syrians or Greeks or Romans Syrians from the place of their birth or warfare Greeks from the religion and language of their sovereign and Romans from the proud appellation which was still profaned by the successors of Constantine  On the plain of Aiznadin as Wajran rode on a white mule decorated with gold chains and surrounded with nens and standards ft was surprised by the near approach of a fierce and naked warrior who had undertaken to view the state of the enemy The adventurous valour of Derar was inspired and has perhaps been adorned by the enthusiasm of his age and country The hatred of the Christians the love of spoil and the contempt of danger were the ruling passions of the audacious Saracen and the prospect of instant death could never shake his religious confidence or ruffle the calmness of his resolution or even suspend the frank and martial pleasantry of his humour In the most hopeless enterprise he was bold and prudent and fortunate after in numerable hazards after being thrice a prisoner in the hands of the infidels he still survived to relate the achievements and to enjoy the rewards of the Sy rian conquest On this occasion his single lance maintained a flying fight against thirty Romans who were detached by Werdan and after killing or unhorsing se venteen of their number Derar returned in safety to his applauding brethren When his rashness was mildly censured by the general he excused himself with the simplicity of a soldier  Nay said Derar  I did not begin first but they came out to take me and I was afraid that God should see me turn my back and indeed I fought in good earnest and without doubt God assisted me against them and had I not been apprehensive of disobeying your orders I should not have come away as I did and I perceive already that they will fall into our hands In the presence of both armies a venerable Greek advanced from the ranks with a liberal offer of peace and the departure of the Saracens would have been pur chased by a gift to each soldier of a turban a robe and a piece of gold ten robes and a hundred pieces to their leader one hundred robes and a thousand pieces to the caliph A smile of indignation expressed the refusal of Caled  Ye Chris tian dogs you know your option the Koran the tribute or the sword We are a people whose delight is in war rather than in peace and we despise your pitiful alms since we shall speedily be masters of your wealth your families and your persons Notwithstanding this apparent disdain he was deeply conscious of the public danger those who had been in Persia and had seen the armies of Chosroes confessed that they never beheld a more formidable array From the superiority of the enemy the artful Saracen derived a fresh incentive of courage  You see before you said he  the united force of the Romans you cannot hope to escape but you may conquer Syria in a single day The event depends on your discipline and patience Reserve yourselves till the evening It was in the evening that the prophet was accustomed to vanquish During two successive engagements his temperate firmness sustained the darts of the enemy and the murmurs of his troops At length when the spirits and quivers of the adverse line were almost exhausted Caled gave the signal of onset and victory The remains of the im perial army fled to Antioch or Ciesarea or Damascus and the death of four hun dred and seventy Moslems was compensated by the opinion that they had sent to hell above fifty thousand of the infidels The spoil was inestimable many ban ners and crosses of gold and silver precious stones silver and gold chains and in numerable suits of the richest armour and apparel The general distribution was postponed till Damascus should be taken but the seasonable supply of arms became the instrument of new victories The glorious intelligence was transmit ted to the throne of the caliph and the Arabian tribes the coldest or most hostile to the prophet s mission were eager and importunate to share the harvest of Syria The sad tidings were carried to Damascus by the speed of grief and terror and the inhabitants beheld from their walls the return of the heroes of Aiznadin Am 1 The name of Werdan is unknown to Theoplianes and though it might belong to an Armenian chief iias very little of a Greek aspect or sound If the Byzantine historians have mangled the oriental names the Arabs in this instance likewise have taken ample revenge on their enemies In transposing the Greek cha racter from right to left might thev not produce from the familiar appellation of Andrea something like the smvgram Werdan THE DECLINE AND FALL rou led the van at the head of nine thousand horse the bands of the Saracens suc ceeded each other in formidable review and the rear was closed by Caled in per son with the standard of the black eagle To the activity of Derar he intrusted the commission of patroling round the city with two thousand horse of scouring the plain and of intercepting all succour or intelligence The rest of the Arabian chiefs were fixed in their respective stations before the seven gates of Damascus and the siege was renewed with fresh vigour and confidence The art the labour the military engines of the Greeks and Romans are seldom to be found in the simple though successful operations of the Saracens it was sufficient for them to invest a city with arms rather than with trenches to repel the sallied of the be sieged to attempt a stratagem or an assault or to expect the progress of famine and discontent Damascus would have acquiesced in the trial of Aiznadin as a final and peremptory sentence between the emperor and the caliph her courage was rekindled by the example and the authority of Thomas a noble Greek il lustrious in a private condition by the alliance of Heraclius l The tumult and illumination of the night proclaimed the design of the morning sally and the Christian hero who affected to despise the enthusiasm of the Arabs employed the general resource of a similar superstition At the principal gate in the sight of both armies a lofty crucifix was erected the bishop with his clergy accom panied the march and laid the volume of the New Testament before the image of Jesus and the contending parties were scandalized or edified by a prayer that the Son of God would defend his servants and vindicate his truth The battle raged with incessant fury and the dexterity of Thomas 2 an incomparable archer was fatal to the boldest Saracens till their death was revenged by a female heroine the wife of Aban who had followed him to the holy war embraced her expiring husband  Happy said she happy art thou my dear thou art gone to thy Lord who first joined us together and then parted us asunder I will revenge thy death and endeavour to the utmost of my power to come to the place where thou art because I love thee Henceforth shall no man ever touch me more for I have dedicated myself to the service of God Without a groan without a tear she washed the corpse of her husband and buried him with the usual rites Then grasping the manly weapons which in her native land she was accustomed to wield the intrepid widow of Aban sought the place where his murderer fought in the thickest of the battle Her first arrow pierced the hand of his standard bear er her second wounded Thomas in the eye and the fainting Christians no longer beheld their ensign or their leader Yet the generous champion of Damascus re fused to withdraw to his palace his wound was dressed on the rampart the fight was continued till the evening and the Syrians rested on their arms In the si lence of the night the signal was given by a stroke on the great bell the gates were thrown open and each gate discharged an impetuous column on the sleeping camp of the Saracens Caled was the first in arms at the head of four hundred horse he flew to the post of danger and the tears trickled down his iron cheeks as he uttered a fervent ejaculation O God who never sleepest look upon thy servants and do not deliver them into the hands of their enemies The valour and victory of Thomas were arrested by the presence of the sword of God with She knowledge of the peril the Moslems recovered their ranks and charged the assailants in the flank and rear After the loss of thousands the Christian general retreated with a sigh of despair and the pursuit of the Saracens was checked by the military engines of the rampart After a siege of seventy days 3 the patience and perhaps the provisions of the Damascenes were exhausted and the bravest of their chiefs submitted to the hard dictates of necessity In the occurrences of peace and war they had been taught to dread the fierceness of Caled and to revere the mild virtues of Abu 0 Vanity prompted the Arabs to believe that Thomas was the son in law of the emperor We

hostilities should cease that the voluntary emigrants might depart in safety with as much as they could carry away of their effects and that the tributary subjects of the caliph should en joy their lands and houses with the use and possession of seven churches On these terms the most respectable hostages and the gate nearest to his camp were delivered into his hands his soldiers imitated the moderation of their chief and he enjoyed the submissive gratitude of a people whom he had rescued from destruction But the success of the treaty had relaxed their vigilance and in the same moment the opposite quarter of the city was betrayed and taken by assault A party of a hundred Arabs had opened the eastern gate to a more in exorable foe No quarter cried the rapacious and sanguinary Caled no quarter to the enemies of the Lord His trumpets sounded and a torrent of Christian blood was poured down the streets of Damascus When he reached the church of St Mary he was astonished and provoked by the peaceful aspect of his companions their swords were in the scabbard and they were surrounded by a multitude of priests and monks â Abu Obeidah saluted the general  God said he  has delivered the city into my hands by way of surrender and lias saved the believers the trouble of fighting â And am I not replied the indignant Caled  am I not the lieutenant of the commander of the faithful Have I not taken the city by storm The unbelievers shall perish by the sword Fall on The hungry and cruel Arabs would have obeyed the welcome command and Damascus was lost if the benevolence of Abu Obeidah had not been supported by a decent and dignified firmness Throwing himself between the trembling citizens and the most eager of the barbarians he abjured them by the holy name of God to respect his promise to suspend their fury and to wait the determination of their chiefs The chiefs retired into the church of St Mary and after a vehement debate Caled submitted in some measure to the reason and authority of his colleague who urged the sanctity of a covenant the advantage as well as the honour which the Moslems would derive from the punctual performance of their word and the obstinate re sistance which thev must encounter from the distrust and despair of the rest of the Syrian cities It was agreed that the sword should be sheathed that the part of Damascus which had surrendered to Abu Obeidah should be immediately en titled to the benefit of his capitulation and that the final decision should be referred to the justice and wisdom of the caliph 1 A large majority of the people accepted the terms of toleration and tribute and Damascus is still peopled by twenty thou sand Christians But the valiant Thomas and the free born patriots who had fought under his banner embraced the alternative of poverty and exile In the adjacent meadow a numerous encampment was formed of priests and laymen of soldiers and citizens of women and children they collected with haste and terror their most precious moveables and abandoned with loud lamentations or silent anguish their native homes and the pleasant banks of the Pharphar The in flexible soul of Caled was not touched by the spectacle of their distress he dis puted with the Damascenes the property of a magazine of corn endeavoured to exclude the garrison from the benefit of the treaty consented with reluctance that each of the fugitives should arm himself with a sword or a lance or a bow and sternly declared that after a respite of three days they might be pursued and treated as the enemies of the Moslems The passion of a

continued till the season of his martyrdom to discharge the duties of a brave and sincere Mussulman When the city was taken he flew to the monastery where Eudocia had taken refuge but the lover was forgotten the apostate was scorned she preferred her religion to her country and the jus tice of Caled though deaf to mercy refused to detain by force a male or female inhabitant of Damascus Four days was the general confined to the city by the obligation of the treaty and the urgent cares of his new conquest His appetite for blood and rapine would have been extinguished by the hopeless computation of time and distance but he listened to the importunities of Jonas who assured him that the weary fugitives might yet be overtaken At the head of four thou sand horse in the disguise of Christian Arabs Caled undertook the pursuit They halted only for the moments of prayer and the guide had a perfect know ledge of the country For a long way the footsteps of the Damascenes were plain and conspicuous they vanished on a sudden but the Saracens were comforted by the assurance that the caravan had turned aside into the mountains and must speedily fall into their hands In traversing the ridges of the Libanus they en dured intolerable hardships and the sinking spirits of the veteran fanatics were supported and cheered by the unconquerable ardour of a lover From a peasant of the country they were informed that the emperor had sent orders to the colony of exiles to pursue without delay the road of the sea coast and of Constantinople apprehensive perhaps that the soldiers and people of Antioch might be discou raged by the sight and the story of their sufferings The Saracens were conducted through the territories of Gabala l and Laodicea at a cautious distance from the walls of the cities the rain was incessant the night was dark a single mountain separated them from the Roman army and Caled ever anxious for the safety of his brethren whispered an ominous dream in the ear of his companion With the dawn of day the prospect again cleared and they saw before them in a pleasant valley the tents of Damascus After a short interval of repose and prayer Caled divided his cavalry into four squadrons committing the first to his faithful Derar and reserving the last for himself They successively rushed on the promiscuous multitude insufficiently provided with arms and already vanquished by sorrow and fatigue Except a captive who was pardoned and dismissed the Arabs en joyed the satisfaction of believing that not a Christian of either sex escaped the edge of their scimitars The gold and silver of Damascus was scattered fiver the camp and a royal wardrobe of three hundred load of silk might clothe an army of naked barbarians In the tumult of the battle Jonas sought and found the object of his pursuit but her resentment was inflamed by the last act of his perfidy and as Eudocia struggled in his hateful embraces she struck a dagger to her heart  Another female the widow of Thomas and the real or supposed daughter of He raclius was spared and released without a ransom but the generosity of Caled was the effect of his contempt and the haughty Saracen insulted by a message of defiance the throne of the Csesars Caled had penetrated above a hundred and fifty miles into the heart of the Roman province he returned to Damascus with the same secrecy and speed On the accession of Omar the sword of God was removed from the command but the caliph who blamed the rashness was com pelled to applaud the vigour and conduct of the enterprise Another expedition of the conquerors of Damascus will equally display their avidity and their contempt for the riches of the present world They were inform ed that the produce and manufactures of the

architecture of the Greeks but as Baalbec has never been the seat of a mo narch we are at a loss to conceive how the expense of these magnificent structures could be supplied by private or municipal liberality 3 From the conquest of Damascus the Saracens proceeded to Heliopolis and Emesa but 1 shall decline the repetition of the sallies and combats which have been already shown on a large scale In the prosecution of the war their policy was not less effectual than their sword By short and separate truces they dissolved the union of the enemy ac customed the Syrians to compart their friendship with their enmity familiarized the idea of their language religion and manners and exhausted by clandestine purchase the magazines and arsenals of the cities which they returned to besiege They aggravated the ransom of the more wealthy or the more obstinate and Chal cis alone was taxed at five thousand ounces of gold five thousand ounces of silver two thousand robes of silk and as many figs and olives as would load five thousand asses But the terms of truce or capitulation were faithfully observed and the lieutenant of the caliph who had promised not to enter the walls of the captive Baalbec remained tranquil and immoveable in his tent till the jarring factions so licited the interposition of a foreign master The conquest of the plain and val ley of Syria was achieved in less than two years Yet the commander of the faith ful reproved the slowness of their progress and the Saracens bewailing their fault with tears of rage and repentance called aloud on their chiefs to lead them forth to fight the battles of the Lord In a recent action under the walls of Emesa an Arabian youth the cousin of Caled was heard aloud to exclaimâ Methinks I see the black eyed girls looking upon me one of whom should she appear in this world all mankind would iVe for love of her And I see in the hand of one of them a handkerchief of green silk and a cap of precious stones and she beckons me and calls out Come hither quickly for I love thee With these words charging the Christians he made havoc wherever he went till observed at length by the gover nor of Hems he was struck through with a javelin It was incumbent on the Saracens to exert the full powers of their valour and enthusiasm against the forces of the emperor who was taught by repeated losses that the rovers of the desert had undertaken and would speedily achiete a regu lar and permanent conquest From the provinces of Europe and Asia fourscore thousand soldiers were transported by sea and land to Antioch and Casarea the light troops of the army consisted of sixty thousand Christian Arabs of the tribes of Gassan Under the banner of Jabalah the last of their princes thev marched in the van and it was a

peremptory order that the fate of the province and the war should be decided by a single battle The Syrians were attached to the standard of Rome and of the cross but the noble the citizen and the peasant were exasperated by the in justice and cruelty of a licentious host who oppressed them as subjects and des pised them as strangers and aliens 1 A report of these mighty preparations was conveyed to the Saracens in their camp of Etnesa and the chiefs though resolved to fight assembled a council the faith of Obu Obeidah would have expected on the same spot the glory of martyrdom the wisdom of Caled advised an honoura ble retreat to the skirts of Palestine and Arabia where they might await the suc cours of their friends and the attack of the unbelievers A speedy messenger soon returned from the throne of Medina with the blessings of Omar and Ali the prayers of the widows of the prophet and a reinforcement of eight thousand Mos lems In their way they overturned a detachment oT Greeks and when they joined at Yermuk the camp of their brethren they found the pleasing intelligence that Caled had already defeated and scattered the Christian Arabs of the tribe of Gassan In the neighbourhood of Bosra the springs of mount Hermon descend in a torrent to the plain of Decapolis or ten cities and the Hieromax a name which has been corrupted to Yermuk is lost after a short course in the lake of Ti berias The banks of this obscure stream were illustrated by a long and bloody encounter On this momentous occasion the public voice and the modesty of Abu Obeidah restored the command to the most deserving of the Moslems Ca led assumed his station in the front his colleague was posted in the rear that the disorder of the fugitives might be checked by his venerable aspect and the sight of the yellow banner which Mahomet had displayed before the walls of Chaibar The last line was occupied by the sister of Derar with the Arabian women who had enlisted in this holy war who were accustomed to wield the bow and the lance and who in a moment of captivity had defended against the uncir cumcised ravishers their chastity and religion 3 The exhortation of the gene ral was brief and forcible Paradise is before you the devil and hell fire in your rear Yet such was the weight of the Roman cavalry that the right wing of the Arabs was broken and separated from the main body Thrice did they retreat in disorder and thrice were they driven back to the charge by the reproaches and blows of the women In the intervals of action Abu Obeidah visited tire tents of his brethren prolonged their repose by repeating at once the prayers of two diffe rent hours bound up their wounds with his own hands and administered the com fortable reflection that the infidels partook of their sufferings without partaking of their reward Four thousand and thirty of the Moslems were buried in the field of battle and the skill of the Armenian archers enabled seven hundred to boast that they had lost an eye in that meritorious service The veterans of the Syrian war acknowledged that it was the hardest and most doubtful of the ciays which they had seen But it was likewise the most decisive many thousands of the Greeks and Syrians fell by the swords of the Arabs many were slaughtered Â after the defeat in the woods and mountains many by mistaking the ford were drowned in the waters of the Yermuk and however the loss may be magnified 4 the Christian writers confess and bewail the bloody punishment of their sins 5 Manuel the Roman general was either killed at Damascus or took refuge

fled with amazement from the stern and equal justice of the caliph The victorious Saracens enjoyed at Da mascus a month of pleasure and repose the spoil was divided by the discretion of Abu Obeidah an equal share was allotted to a soldier and to his horse and a double portion was reserved for the noble coursers of the Arabian breed After the battle of Yermuk the Roman army no longer appeared in the field and the Saracens might securely choose among the fortified towns of Syria the first object of their attack They consulted the caliph whether they should march to Cxsarea or Jerusalem and the advice of Ali determined the immediate siege of the latter To a profane eye Jerusalem was the first or second capital of Pales tine but after Mecca and Medina it was revered and visited by the devout Mos lems as the temple of the Holy Land which had been sanctified by the revela tion of Moses of Jesus and of Mahomet himself The son of Abu Sophian was sent with five thousand Arabs to try the first experiment of surprise or treaty  but on the eleventh day the town was invested by the whole force of Abu Obeidah He addressed the customary summons to the chief commanders and people of JElia l  Health and happiness to every one that follows the right way we re uire of you to testify that there is but one God and that Mahomet is his apostle f you refuse this consent to pay tribute and be under us forthwith Otherwise I shall bring men against you who love death better than you do the drinking of wine or eating hog s flesh Nor will I ever stir from you if it please God till I have destroyed those that fight for you and made slaves of your children But the city was defended on every side by deep valleys and steep ascents since the invasion of Syria the walls and towers had been anxiously restored the bravest of the fugitives of Yermuk had stopped in the nearest place of refuge and in the de fence of the sepulchre of Christ the natives and strangers might feel some sparks of the enthusiasm which so fiercely glowed in the bosoms of the Saracens The siege of Jerusalem lasted four months not a day was lost without some action of sally or assault the military engines incessantly played from the ramparts and the inclemency of the winter was still more painful and destructive to the Arabs The Christians yielded at length to the perseverance of the besiegers The pa triarch Sophromus appeared on the walls and by the voice of an interpreter de manded a conference After a vain attempt to dissuade the lieutenant of the caliph from his impious enterprise he proposed in the name of the people a fair capitu lation with this extraordinary clause that the articles of security should be ratified by the authority and presence of Omar himself The question was debated in the council of Medina the sanctity of the place and the advice of Ali persuaded the caliph to gratify the wishes of his soldiers and enemies and the simplicity of his journey is more illustrious than the royal pageants of vanity and oppression TTie conqueror of Persia and Syria was mounted on a red camel which carried besides his person a bag of corn a bag of dates a wooden dish and a leather bottle of water Wherever he halted the company without distinction was invited to partake of his homely fare and the repast was consecrated bv the prayer and exhortation of the commander of the faithful 2 But in this expedition or pil grimage his power was exercised in the administration of justice he reformed the licentious polygamy of the Arabs relieved the tributaries from extortion and icruelty and chastised the luxury of the Saracens by despoiling them of their rich silks and dragging them on their faces in the dirt When he came within sight of Jerusalem the caliph cried with a loud voice â God is victorious O Lord give us an easy conquest and pitching his tent of coarse hair calmly seated him self on the ground After signing the capitulation he entered the city without fear or precaution and courteously discoursed with the patriarch concerning its religious antiquities 3 Sophronius bowed before his new master and secretly some panegyrical strains of an Arabian port to

request the Moslems of a future age would have infringed the treaty under colour of imitating my example By his command the ground of the temple of Solomon was prepared for the foundation of a mosch 2 and during a residence of ten days he regulated the present and future state of his Syrian conquests Me dina might be jealous lest the caliph should be detained by the sanctity of Jerusa lem or the beauty of Damascus her apprehensions were dispelled by his prompt and voluntary return to the tomb of the apostle 3 To achieve what yet remained of the Syrian war the caliph had formed two separate armies a chosen detachment under Amrou and Vczid was left in the camp of Palestine while the larger division under the standard of Abu Obeidah and fcaled marched away to the north against Antioch and Aleppo The latter of these the Berxa of the Greeks was not yet illustrious as the capital of a pro vince or a kingdom and the inhabitants by anticipating their submission and pleading their povertv obtained a moderate composition for their lives and reli gion But the castle of Aleppo 4 distinct from the city stood erect on a lofty artificial mound the sides were sharpened to a precipice and faced with free stone  and the breadth pf the ditch might be filled with water from the neighbouring springs After the loss of three thousand men the garrison was still equal to the defence and Youkinna their valiant and hereditary chief had murdered his bro ther a holy monk for daring to pronounce the name of peace In a siege of four or five months the hardest of the Syrian war great numbers of the Saracens were killed and wounded their removal to the distance of a mile could not seduce the vigilance of Youkinna nor could the Christians be terrified by the execution of three hundred captives whom they beheaded before the c astle wall The si lence and at length the complaints of Abii Obeidah informed the caliph that their hope and patience were consumed arthe foot of this impregnable fortress  1 am variously affected replied Omar by the difference of your success but I charge you by no means to raise the siege of the castle Your retreat would di minish the reputation of our arms and encourage the infidels to fall upon you on all sides Remain before Aleppo till God shall determine the event and forage with your horse round the adjacent country The exhortation of the commander of the faithful was fortified by a supply of volunteers from all the tribes of Arabia who arrived in the camp on horses or camels Among these was Dames of a servile birth but of gigantic size and intrepid resolution The forty seventh day of his service he proposed with only thirty men to make an attempt on the cas tle The experience and testimony of Caled recommended his offer and Abu Obeidah admonished his brethren not to despise the baser origin of Dames since he himself could he relinquish the publie care would cheerfully serve under the banner of the slave His design was covered by the appearance of a retreat and the camp of the Saracens was pitched about a league from Aleppo The thirty adventurers lay in ambush at the foot of the hill and Dames at length succeeded in his inquiries though he was provoked by the ignorance of his Greek captives God curse these dogs said the illiterate Arab what a strange barbarous language they speak At the darkest hour of the night

Caled with the dawn of day relieved their danger and assured their conquest Youkinna a formidable foe became an active and useful prose lyte and the general of the Saracens expressed his regard for the most humble merit by detaining the army at Aleppo till Dames was cured of his honourable wounds The capital of Syria was still covered by the castle of Azaz and the iron bridge of the Orontes After the loss of these important posts and the defeat of the last of the Roman armies the luxury of Ahtioch l trembled and obeyed Her safety was ransomed with three hundred thousand pieces of gold but the throne of the successors of Alexander the seat of the Roman government in the east which had been decorated by Cssar with the titles of free and holy and in violate was degraded under the yoke of the caliphs to the secondary rank of a provincial town 2 In the life of Heraclius the glories of the Persian war are clouded on either hand by the disgrace and weakness of his more early and his later days When the successors of Mahomet unsheathed the sword of war and religion he was as tonished at the boundless prospect of toil and danger his nature was indolent nor could the infirm and frigid age of the emperor be kindled to a second effort The sense of shame and the importunities of the Syrians prevented his hasty depar ture from the scene of action but the hero was no more and the loss of Damascus and Jerusalem the bloody fields of Aiznadin and Yermuk may be imputed in some degree to the absence or misconduct of the sovereign Instead of defending the sepulchre of Christ he involved trre church and state in a metaphysical contro versy for the unity of his will and while Heraclius crowned the offspring of his se cond nuptials he was tamely stripped of the most valuable part of their inheritance In the cathedral of Atitioch in the presence of the bishops at the foot of the cru cifix he bewailed the sins of the prince and people but his confession instructed the world that it was in vain and perhaps impious to resist the judgment of God The Saracens were invincible in fact since they were invincible in opinion and the desertion of Youkinna his false repentance and repeated perfidy might justify the suspicion of the emperor that he was encompassed by tr aitors and apostates who conspired to betray his person and their country to the enemies of Christ In the hour of adversity his superstition was agitated by the omens and dreams of a fall ing crown ami after bidding an eternal farewell to Syria he secretly embarked with a few attendants and absolved the faith of his subjects 3 Constantine his eldest son had been stationed with forty thousand men at Crcsarea the civil metro polis of the three provinces of Palestine But his private interest recalled him to the Byzantine court and after the flight of his father he felt himself an unequal champion to the united force of the caliph His vanguard was boldly attacked by three hundred Arabs and a thousand black slaves who in the depth of winter had climbed the snowy mountains of Libanus and who were speedily followed by the victorious squadrons of Caled himself From the north and south the troops of

faithful captives might exercise a passive and more arduous resolution and a cousin of Mahomet is cele brated for refusing after an abstinence of three days the wine and pork the only nourishment that was allowed by the malice of the infidels The frailty of some weaker brethren exasperated the implacable spirit of fanaticism and the father of Amer deplored in pathetic strains the apostacy and damnation of a son who had renounced the promises of God and the intercession of the prophet to occupy with the priests and deacons the lowest mansions of hell The more fortunate Arabs who survived the war and persevered in the faith were restrained by their abstemious leader from the abuse of prosperity After a refreshment of three days Abu Obeidah withdrew his troops from the pernicious contagion of the luxury of Antioch and assured the caliph that their religion and virtue could omy be pre served by the hard discipline of poverty and labour But the virtue of Omar how ever rigorous to himself was kind and liberal to his brethren After a just tribute of praise and thanksgiving he dropped a tear of compassion and sitting down on the ground wrote an answer in which he mildly censured the severity of his lieu tenant  God said the successor of the prophet has not forbidden the use of the good things of this world to faithful men and such as have performed good works Therefore you ought to have given them leave to rest themselves and par â take freely of those good things which the country affordeth If any of the Saracens have no families in Arabia they may marry in Syria and whosoever of them wants any female slaves he may purchase as many as he hath occasion for The con querors prepared to use or to abuse this gracious permission but the year of their triumph was marked by a mortality of men and cattle and twenty five thousand Saracens were snatched away from the possession of Syria The death of Abu Obeidah might be lamented by the Christians but

magnanimous Omar trusted in his God and his sword which had shaken the thrones of Chosroes and Caisar but when he compared the slender force of the Moslems with the greatness of the enter prise he condemned his own rashness and listened to his timid companions The pride and the greatness of Pharaoh were familiar to the readers of the Koran and a tenfold repetition of prodigies had been scarcely sufficient to effect not the victory but the flight of six hundred thousand of the children of Israel the cities of Egypt were many and populous their architecture was strong and solid the Nile with its numerous branches was alone an insuperable barrier and the gra nary of the imperial city would be obstinately defended by the Roman powers In this perplexity the commander of the faithful resigned himself to the decision of chance or in his opinion of Providence At the head of only four thousand Arabs the intrepid Amrou had marched away from his station of Gaza when he was overtaken by the messenger of Omar  If you are still in Syria said the ambiguous mandate retreat without delay but if at the receipt of this epistle you have already reached the frontiers of Egypt advance with confidence and depend on the succour of God and of your brethren The experience per haps the secret intelligence of Amrou had taught him to suspect the mutability of courts and he continued his march till his tents were unquestionably pitched on Egyptian ground He there assembled his officers broke the seal perused the epistle gravely inquired the name and situation of the place and declared his ready obedience to the commands of the caliph After a siege of thirty days he took possession of Farmah or Pelusium and that key of Egypt as it has been justly named unlocked the entrance of the

might fairly be described as a part of Memphis or Misrah was invested by Ihe arms of the lieutenant of Omar a re enforcement of four thousand Saracens soon arrived in his camp and the military engines which battered the walls may be imputed to the art and labour of his Syrian allies Yet the siege was pro tracted to seven months and the rash invaders were encompassed and threatened by the inundation of the Nile 2 Their last assault was bold and successful they passed the ditch which had been fortified with iron spikes applied their scaling ladders entered the fortress with the shout of God is

resolved to live and die in the profession of the gos pel and unity of Christ It is impossible for us to embrace the revelations of your prophet but we are desirous of peace and cheerfully submit to pay tribute and obedience to his temporal successors The tribute was ascertained at two pieces of gold for the head of every Christian but old men monks women and children of both sexes under sixteen years of age were exempted from this personal as sessment the Copts above and below Memphis swore allegiance to the caliph and promised a hospitable entertainment of three days to every Mussulman who should travel through their country By this charter of security the ecclesiasti cal and civil tyranny of the Melchites was destroyed l the anathemas of St Cy ril were thundered from every pulpit and the sacred edifices with the patrimony of the church were restored to the national communion of the Jacobites who en joyed without moderation the moment of triumph and revenge At the pressing summons of Amrou their patriarch Benjamin emerged from his desert and af ter the first interview the courteous Arab affected to declare that he had never conversed with a Christian priest of more innocent manners and a more venera ble aspect 2 In the march from Memphis to Alexandria the lieutenant of Omar intrusted his safety to the zeal and gratitude of the Egyptians the roads and bridges were diligently repaired and in every step of his progress he could depend on a constant supply of provisions and intelligence The Greeks of Egypt whose numbers could scarcely equal a tenth of the natives were over whelmed by the universal defection they had ever been hated they were no lon ger feared the magistrate fled from his tribunal the bishop from his altar and the distant garrisons were surprised or starved by the surrounding multitudes Had not the Nile afforded a safe and ready conveyance to the sea not an individual could have escaped who by birth or language or office or religion was con nected with their odious name By the retreat of the Greeks from the provinces of Upper Egypt a considera ble force was collected in the island of Delta the natural and artificial channels of the Nile afforded a succession of strong and defensible posts and the road to Alexandria was laboriously cleared by the victory of the Saracens in two and twenty days of general or partial combat In their annals of conquest the siege of Alexandria 3 is perhaps the most arduous and important enterprise The first trading city in the world was abundantly replenished with the means of sub sistence and defence Her numerous inhabitants fought for the dearest of human rights religion and property and the enmity of the natives seemed to exclude them from the common benefit of peace and toleration The sea was continual ly open and if Heraclius had been awake to the public distress fresh armies of Romans and barbarians might have been poured into the harbour to save the se cond capital of the

Eutychius the patriarch observes that the Saracens fought with the courage of lions they repulsed the frequent and almost daily sallies of the be sieged and soon assaulted in their turn the walls and towers of the city In eve ry attack the sword the banner of Amrou glittered in the van of the Moslems On a memorable day he was betrayed by his imprudent valour his followers who had entered the city were driven back and the general with a friend and a slave remained a prisoner in the hands of the Christians When Amrou was conducted before the prefect he remembered his dignity and forgot his situation a lofty demeanour and resolute language revealed the lieutenant of the caliph and the battle axe of a soldier was already raised to strike off the head of the audacious captive His life was saved by the readiness of his slave who instant ly gave his master a blow on the face and commanded him with an angry tone to be silent in the presence of his superiors The credulous Greek was deceived he listened to the offers of a treaty and his prisoners were dismissed in the hope of a more respectable embassy till the joyful acclamations of the camp announced the return of their general and insulted the folly of the infidels At length after a siege of fourteen nionths l and the loss of three and twenty thousand men the Saracens prevailed the Greeks embarked their dispirited and diminished numbers and the standard of Mahomet was planted on the walls of the capital of Egypt  I have taken said Amrou to the caliph  the great city of the west It is impossible for me to enumerate the variety of its riches and beauty and I shall content myself with observing that it contains four thousand palaces four thousand baths four hundred theatres or places of amusement twelve thousand shops for the sale of vegetable food and forty thousand tributary Jews The town has been subdued by force of arms without treaty or capitulation and the Moslems are impatient to seize the fruits of their victory 2 The commander of the faithful rejected with firmness the idea of pillage and directed his lieute nant to reserve the wealth and revenue of Alexandria for the public service and the propagation of the faith the inhabitants were numbered a tribute was im posed the zeal and resentment of the Jacobites were curbed and the Melchites who submitted to the Arabian yoke were indulged in the obscure but tranquil ex ercise of their worship The intelligence of this disgraceful and calamitous event afflicted the declining health of the emperor and Heraclius died of a dropsy about seven weeks after the loss of Alexandria 3 Under the minority of his grandson the clamours of a people deprived of their daily sustenance com pelled the Byzantine court to undertake the recovery of the capital of Egypt In the space of four years the harbour and fortifications of Alexandria were twice occupied by a fleet and army of Romans They were twice expelled by the valour of Amrou who was recalled by the domestic peril from the distant wars of Tripoli and Nubia But the facility of the attempt the repetition of the insult and the obstinacy of the resistance provoked him to swear that if a third time he drove the infidels into the sea he would render Alexandria as accessible on all sides as the house of a prostitute Faithful to his promise he dismantled several parts of the walls and towers but the people were spared in the chas tisement of the city and the mosch of Mercy was erected on the spot where the victorious general had stopped the fury of his troops I should deceive the expectation of the reader if I passed in silence the fate of the Alexandrian library as it is described by the learned Abulpharagius The spirit of Amrou was more curious and liberal than that of his

library which alone among the spoils of Alexandria had not been appropriated by the visit and the seal of the conqueror Amrou was inclined to gratify the wish of the grammarian but his rigid integrity refused to alienate the minutest object without the consent of the caliph and the well known answer of Omar was inspired by the ignorance of a fanatic  If these writings of the Greeks agree with the book of God they are useless and need not be preserved if they disagree they are pernicious and ought to be destroyed The sentence was executed with blind obedience the vo lumes of paper or parchment were distributed to the four thousand baths of the city and such was their incredible multitude that six months were barely suffi cient for the consumption of this precious fuel Since the dynasties of Abulpha ragius 2 have been given to the world in a Latin version the tale has been re peatedly transcribed and every scholar with pious indignation has deplored the irreparable shipwreck of the learning the arts and the genius of antiquity For my own part I am strongly tempted to deny both the fact and the consequences The fact is indeed marvellous Read and wonder says the historian himself and the solitary report of a stranger who wrote at the end of six hundred years on the confines of Media is overbalanced by the silence of two annalists of a more early date both Christians both natives of Egypt and the most ancient of whom the patriarch Eutychius has amply described the conquest of Alexan dria 3 The rigid sentence of Omar is repugnant to the sound and orthodox precept of the Mahometan casuists they expressly declare that the religious books ef the Jews and Christians which are acquired by the right of war should never be committed to the flames and that the works of profane science histo rians or poets physicians or philosophers may be lawfully applied to the use of the faithful 4 â A more destructive zeal may perhaps be attributed to the first successors of Mahomet yet in this instance the conflagration would have speedi ly expired in the deficiency of materials I shall not recapitulate the disasters of the Alexandrian library the involuntary flames that were kindled by Cjcsar in his own defence 5 or the mischievous bigotry of the Christians who studied to destroy the monuments of idolatry 6 But if we gradually descend from the age of the Antonines to that of Theodosius we shall learn from a chain of co temporary witnesses that the royal palace and the temple of Serapis no longer contained the four or the seven hundred thousand volumes which had been as sembled by the curiosity and magnificence of the Ptolemies 7 Perhaps the church and seat of the patriarchs might be enriched with a repository of books but if the ponderous mass of Arian and

interesting facts are buried in oblivion the three great historians of Rome have been transmitted to our hands in a mutilated state and we are deprived of many pleasing compositions of the lyric ia ibic and dramatic poetry of the Greeks Yet we should gratefully remember that the mischances of time and accident have spared the classic works to which the suffrage of antiquity l had adjudged the first place of genius and glory the teachers of ancient knowledge who are still extant had perused and compared the writings of their predeces sors nor can it fairly be presumed that any important truth any useful disco very in art or nature has been snatched away from the curiosity of modern ages In the administration of Egypt 3 Amrou balanced the demands of justice and policy the interest of the people of the law who were defended by God and of the people of the alliance who were protected by man In the recent tumult of conquest and deliverance the tongue of the Copts and the sword of the Arabs were most adverse to the tranquillity of the province To the former Amrou de clared that faction and falsehood would be doubly chastised by the punishment of the accusers whom he should detest as his personal enemies and by the pro motion of their innocent brethren whom their envy had laboured to injure and supplant He excited the latter by the motives of religion and honour to sustain the dignity of their character to endear themselves by a modest and temperate conduct to God and the caliph to spare and protect a people who had trusted to their faith and to content themselves with the legitimate and splendid rewards of their victory In the management of the revenue he disapproved the simple but oppressive mode of a capitation and preferred with reason a proportion of taxes deducted on every branch from the clear profits of agriculture and commerce A third part of the tribute was appropriated to the annual repairs of the dikes and canals so essential to the public welfare Under his administration the fertility of Egypt supplied the dearth of Arabia and a string of camels laden with corn and provisions covered almost without an interval the long road from Memphis to Medina 4 But the genius of Amrou soon venewed the maritime communica tion which had been attempted or achieved by the Pharaohs the Ptolemies or the Caesars and a canal at least eighty miles in length was opened from the Nile to the Red Sea This inland navigation which would have joined the Mediterra nean and the Indian ocean was soon discontinued as useless and dangerous the throne was removed from Medina to Damascus and the Grecian fleets might have explored a passage to the holy cities of Arabia 5 Of his new conquest the caliph Omar had an imperfect knowledge from the voice of fame and the legends of the Koran He requested that his lieutenant would place before his eyes the realm of Pharaoh and the Amalekites and the answer of Amrou exhibits a lively and not unfaithful picture of that

pious design was approved by the companions of Mahomet and the chiefs of the tribes and twenty thousand Arabs marched from Medina with the gifts and the blessings of the commander of the faithful They were joined in the camp of Memphis by twenty thousand of their countrymen and the conduct of the war was intmsted to Abdallah 2 the son of Said and the foster brother of the caliph who had lately supplanted the conqueror and lieutenant of Egypt Yet the favour of the prince and the merit of his favourite could not obliterate the guilt of his apostacy The early con version of Abdallah and his skilful pen had recommended him to the important office of transcribing the sheets of the Koran he betrayed his trust corrupted the text derided the errors which he had made and fled to Mecca to escape the justice and expose the ignorance of the apostle After the conquest of Mecca he fell prostrate at the feet of Mahomet his tears and the entreaties of Othman ex torted a reluctant pardon but the prophet declared that he had so long hesitated to allow time for some zealous disciple to avenge his injury in the blood of the apostate With apparent fidelity and effective merit he served the religion which it was no longer his interest to desert his birth and talents gave him an honourable rank among the Koreish and in a nation of cavalry Abdallah was re nowned as the boldest and most dexterous horseman of Arabia At the head of forty thousand Moslems he advanced from Egypt into the unknown countries of the west The sands of Barca might be impervious to a Roman legion but the Arabs were attended by their faithful camels and the natives of the desert beheld without terror the familiar aspect of the soil and climate After a painful march they pitched their tents before the walls of Tripoli 3 a maritime city in which the name the wealth and the inhabitants of the province had gradually centred and which now maintains the third rank among the states of Barbary A re enforcement of Greeks was surprised and cut in pieces on the sea shore but the fortifications of Tripoli resisted the first assaults and the Saracens were tempt ed by the approach of the prefect Gregory 4 to relinquish the labours of the siege for the perils and the hopes of a decisive action If his standard was fol lowed by one hundred and twenty thousand men the regular bands of the empire must have been lost in the naked and disorderly crowd of Africans and Moors who formed the strength or rather the numbers of his host He rejected with indignation the option of the Koran or the tribute and during several days the two armies were fiercely engaged from the dawn of light to the hour of noon when their fatigue and the excessive heat compelled them to seek shelter and refresh ment in their respective camps The daughter of Gregory a maid of incomparable beauty and spirit is said to have fought by his side from her earliest youth she was trained to mount on horseback to draw the bow and to wield the scimitar and the richness of her arms and apparel was conspicuous in the foremost ranks of the battle Her hand with a hundred thousand pieces of gold was offered for the head of the Arabian general and the youths of Africa were excited by the prospect of the glorious prize At the pressing solicitation of his brethren Abdal lah withdrew his person from the field but the Saracens

Abdallah On the news of the battle Zobeir with twelve companions cut his way through the camp of the Greeks and pressed for ward without either tastingfood or repose to partake of the dangers of his brethren He cast his eyes round the field  Where said he  is our general â In his tent â Is the tent a station for the general of the Moslems Abdallah represented with a blush the importance of his

which inclined the long disputed ba lance in favour of the Saracens Supplying by activity and artifice the deficiency of numbers a part of their forces lay concealed in their tents while the remainder prolonged an irregular skirmish with the enemy till the sun was high in the hea vens On both sides they retired with fainting steps their horses were unbridled their armour was laid aside and the hostile nations prepared or seemed to pre pare for the refreshment of the evening and the encounter of the ensuing day On a sudden the charge was sounded the Arabian camp poured forth a swarm of fresh and intrepid warriors and the long line of the Greeks and Africans was surprised assaulted overturned by new squadrons of the faithful who to the eye of fanaticism might appear as a band of angels descending from the sky The prefect himself was slain by the hand of Zobeir his daughter who sought revenge and death was surrounded and Â made prisoner and the fugitives in volved in their disaster

the fall of this opulent city the provincials and barbarians implored on all sides the mercy of the conqueror His vanity or his zeal might be flattered by offers of tribute or professions of faith but his losses his fatigues and the progress of an epidemical disease prevented a solid establish ment and the Saracens after a campaign of fifteen months retreated to the con fines of Egypt with the captives and the wealth of their African expedition The caliph s fifth was granted to a favourite on the nominal payment of five hundred thousand pieces of gold 3 but the state was doubly injured by this fallacious transaction if each foot soldier had shared one thousand and each horseman three thousand pieces in the real division of the plunder The author of the death of Gregory was expected to have claimed the most precious reward of the victory from his silence it might be presumed that he had fallen in the battle till the tears and exclamations of the prefect s daughter at the sight of Zobeir revealed the valour and modesty of that gallant soldier The unfortunate virgin was offered and almost rejected as a slave by her father s murderer who coolly declared that his sword was consecrated to the service of religion and that he laboured for a recompense far above the charms of mortal beauty or the riches of this transito ry life A reward congenial to his temper was the honourable commission of an nouncing to the caliph Othman the success of his arms The companions the chiefs and the people were assembled in the mosch of Medina to hear the in teresting narrative of

stipulate with the Arabs but instead of being moved to pity and relieve their distresses they imposed as an equivalent or a fine sji second tribute of a si milar amount The ears of the Byzantine ministers were shut against the com plaints of their poverty and ruin their despair was reduced to prefer the domi nion of a single master and the extortions of the patriarch of Carthage who was invested with civil and military power provoked the sectaries and even the ca tholics of the Roman province to abjure the religion as well as the authority of their tyrants The first lieutenant of Moawiyah acquired a just renown subdued an important city defeated an army of thirty thousand Greeks swept away four score thousand captives anil enriched with their spoils the bold adventurers of Sy ria and Egypt 1 But the title of conqueror of Africa is more justly due to his successor Akbah He marched from Damascus at the head of ten thousand of the bravest Arabs and the genuine force of the Moslems was enlarged by the doubtful aid and conversion of many thousand barbarians It would be difficult nor is it necessary to tiace the accurate line of the progress of Akbah The in terior regions have been peopled by tlve orientals with fictitious armies and imagi nary citadels In the warlike province of Zab or Numidia fourscore thousand of the natives might assemble in arms but the number of three hundred and sixty towns is incompatible with the ignorance or decay of husbandry 2 and a circum ference of three leagues will not be justified by the ruins of Erbe or Lambesa the ancient metropolis of that inland country As we approach the sea coast the well known cities of Bugia 3 and Tangier 4 define the more certain limits of the Saracen victories A remnant of trade still adheres to the commodious harbour of Bugia which in a more prosperous age is said to have contained about twenty thousand houses and the plenty of iron which is dug from the adjacent mountains might have supplied a braver people with the instruments of defence The remote position and venerable antiquity of Tingi or Tangier have been decorated by the Greek and Arabian fables but the figurative expressions of the latter that the walls were constructed of brass and that the roofs were covered with gold and sil ver may be interpreted as the emblems of strength and opulence The province of Mauritania Tingitana 5 which assumed the name of the capital had been im perfectly discovered and settled by the Romans the five colonies were confined to a narrow pale and the more souchern parts were seldom explored except by the agents of luxury who searched the forests for ivory and citron wood 6 and the shores of the ocean for the purple shell fish The fearless Akbah plunged into the heart

sighed for new worlds was unable to preserve his recent con quests By the universal defection of the Greeks and Africans he was recalled from the shores of the Atlantic and the surrounding multitudes left him only the resource of an honourable death The last scene was dignified by an example of national virtue An ambitious chief who had disputed the command and failed in the attempt was led about as a prisoner in the camp of the Arabian general The insurgents had trusted to his discontent and revenge he disdained their offers and revealed their designs In the hour of danger the grateful Akbah unlocked his fetters and advised him to retire he chose to die under the banner of his rival Embracing as friends and martyrs they unsheathed their scimitars broke their scabbards and maintained an obstinate combat till they fell by each other s side on the last of their slaughtered countrymen The third general or governor of Africa Zobeir avenged and encountered the fate of his predecessor He van quished the natives in many battles he was overthrown by a powerful army which Constantinople had sent to the relief of Carthage It had been the frequent practice of the Moorish tribes to join the invaders to share the plunder to profess the faith and to revolt to their savage state of inde pendence and idolatry on the first retreat or misfortune of the Moslems The prudence of Akbah had proposed to found an Arabian colony in the heart of Africa a citadel that might curb the levity of the barbarians a place of refuge to secure against the accidents of war the wealth and the families of the Saracens With this view and under the modest title of the station of a caravan he planted this colony in the fiftieth year of the Hegira In its present decay Cairoan 2 still holds the second rank in the kingdom of Tunis from which it is distant about fifty miles to the south 3 its inland situation twelve miles westward of the sea has protected the city from the Greek and Sicilian fleets When the wild beasts and serpents were extirpated when the forest or rather wilderness was cleared the vestiges of a Roman town were discovered in a sandy plain the vegetable food of Cairoan is brought from afar and the scarcity of springs constrains the inhabi tants to collect in cisterns and reservoirs a precarious supply of rain water These obstacles were subdued by the industry of Akbah lie traced a circumstance of three thousand and six hundred paces which he encompassed with a brick wall in the space of five years the governor s palace was surrounded with a sufficient number of

glories of a later age the new colony was shaken by the successive defeats of Akbah and Zobeir and the western expeditions were again interrupted by the civil discord of the Arabian monarchy The son of the valiant Zobeir maintained a war of twelve years a siege of seven months against the house of Ommiyah Abdallah was said to unite the fierceness of the lion with the subtlety of the fox but if he

AND PALL crated to the important service In the vicissitudes of war the interior provincef had been alternately won and lost by the Saracens But the sea coast still re mained in the hands of the Greeks the predecessors of Hassan had respected the name and fortifications of Carthage and the number of its defenders was recruited by the fugitives of Cabes and Tripoli The arms of Hassan were bolder and more fortunate he reduced and pillaged the metropolis of Africa and the mention of scaling ladders may justify the suspicion that he anticipated by a sudden assault the more tedious operations of a regular siege But the joy of the conquerors was soon disturbed by the appearance of the Christian succours The prefect and pa trician John a general of experience and renown embarked at Constantinople the forces of the eastern empire l they were joined by the ships and soldiers of Si cily and a powerful re enforcement of Goths 2 was obtained from the fears and religion of the Spanish monarch The weight of the confederate navy broke the chain that guarded the entrance of the harbour the Arabs retired to Cairoan or Tripoli the Christians landed the citizens hailed the ensign of the cross and the winter was idly wasted in the dream of victory or deliverance But Africa was irrecoverably lost the zeal and resentment of the commander of the faithful 3 prepared in the ensuing spring a more numerous armament by sea and land and tlie patrician in his turn was compelled to evacuate the post and fortifications of Carthage A second battle was fought in the neighbourhood of Utica the Greeks and Goths were again defeated and their timely embarkation saved them from the sword of Hassan who had invested the slight and insufficient rampart of their camp Whatever yet remained of Carthage was delivered to the flames and the colony of Dido 4 and C esar lay desolate above two hundred years till a part perhaps a twentieth of the old circumference was repeopled by the first of the Fatimite caliphs In the beginning of the sixteenth century the second capital of the west was represented by a mosch a college without students twenty five or thirty shops and the huts of five hundred peasants who in their abject poverty displayed the arrogance of the Punic senators Even that paltry village was swept away by the Spaniards whom Charles V had stationed in the fortress of the

victorious prophetess assembled the Moorish chiefs and recommended a measure of strange and savage policy  Our cities said she  and the gold and silver which they contain perpetually attract the arms of the Arabs These vile metals are not the objects of our ambition we content ourselves with the simple productions of the earth Let us destroy these cities let us bury in their ruins those pernicious

From Tangier to Tripoli the buildings or at least the fortifications were demolished the fruit trees were cut down the means of subsistence were extirpated a fertile and populous garden was changed into a desert and the historians of a more recent period could discern the frequent traces of the prosperity and devastation of their ancestors Such is the tale of the modern Arabians Yet I strongly suspect that their ignorance of antiquity the love of the marvellous and the fashion of extolling the philosophy of barbarians has induced them to describe as one voluntary act the calamities of three hun dred years since the first fury of the Donatists and Vandals In the progress of the revolt Cahina had most probably contributed her share of destruction and the alarm of universal ruin might terrify and alienate the cities that had reluctantly yielded to her unworthy yoke They no longer hoped perhaps they no longer wished the return of their Byzantine sovereigns their present servitude was not alleviated by the benefits of order and justice and the most zealous catholic must prefer the imperfect truths of the Koran to the blind and rude idolatry of the Moors The general of the Saracens was again received as the saviour of the pro vince the friends of civil society conspired against the savages of the land and the royal prophetess was slain in the first battle which overturned the baseless fabric of her superstition and empire The same spirit survived under the successor of Hassan it was finally quelled by the activity of Musa and his two sons but the number of the rebels may be presumed from that of three hundred thousand cap tives sixty thousand of whom the caliph s fifth were sold for the profit of the public treasury Thirty thousand of the barbarian

victory was repulsed from the walls of Ceuta by the vigilance and courage of count Julian the general of the Goths From his disap pointment and perplexity Musa was relieved by an unexpected message of the Christian chief who offered his place his person and his sword to the successors of Mahomet and solicited the disgraceful honour of introducing their arms into the heart of Spain 1 If we inquire into the cause of his treachery the Spaniards will repeat the popular story of his daughter Cava 2 of a virgin who was se duced or ravished by her sovereign of a father who sacrificed his religion and country to the thirst of revenge The passions of princes have often been licen tious and destructive but this well known tale romantic in itself is indifferently supported by external evidence and the history of Spain will suggest some mo tives of interest and policy more congenial to the breast of a veteran statesman 3 After the decease or deposition of Witiza his two sons were supplanted by the ambition of Roderic a noble Goth whose father the duke or governor of a pro vince had fallen a victim to the preceding tyranny The monarchy was still elective but the sons of Witiza educated on the steps of the throne were impa tient of a private station Their resentment was the more dangerous as it was varnished with the dissimulation of courts their followers were excited by the re membrance of favours and the promise of a revolution and their uncle Oppas archbishop of Toledo and Seville was the first person in the church and the se cond in the state It was probable that Julian was involved in the disgrace of the unsuccessful faction that he had little to hope and much to fear from the new reign and that the imprudent king could not forget or forgive the injuries which Roderic and his family had sustained The merit and influence of the count ren dered him a useful or formidable subject his estates were ample his followers bold and numerous and it was too plainly shown that by his Andalusian and Mau ritanian commands he held in his hands the keys of the Spanish monarchy Too feeble however to meet his sovereign in arms he sought the aid of a foreign power and his rash invitation of the Moors and Arabs produced the calamities of eight hundred years In his epistles or in a personal interview he revealed the wealth and nakedness of his country the weakness of an unpopular prince the degeneracy of an effeminate people The Goths were no longer the victorious barbarians who had humbled the pride of Rome despoiled the queen of nations and penetrated from the Danube to the Atlantic ocean Secluded from the world by the Pyrenean mountains the successors of Alaric had slumbered in a long peace the walls of the cities were mouldered into dust the youth had abandoned the exercise of arms and the presumption of their ancient renown would expose them in a field of battle to the first assault of the invaders The ambitious Sara cen was fired by the ease and importance of the attempt but the execution was delayed till he had consulted the commander of the faithful and his messenger returned with the permission of Walid to annex the unknown kingdoms of the west to the religion and throne of the caliphs In his residence of Tangier Musa with secrecy and caution continued his correspondence and hastened his prepara tions But the remorse of the conspirators was soothed by the fallacious assu rance that he should content himself with the glory and spoil without aspiring to establish the Moslems beyond the sea that separates Africa from Europe 4 1 The fall

the royal summons the dukes and counts the bishops and nobles of the Gothic monarchy assembled at the head of their followers and the title of king of the Romans which is employed by an Arabic historian may be excused by the close affinity of language religion and manners between the nations of Spain His army consisted of ninety or a hun dred thousand men a formidable power if their fidelity and discipline had been adequate to their numbers The troops of Tarik had been augmented to twelve thousand Saracens but the Christian malecontents were attracted by the influence of Julian

and silken embroide ry and reclining on a litter or car of ivory drawn by two white mules Not withstanding the valour of the Saracens they fainted under the weight of multi tudes and the plain of

in the waters of the Bcetis or Guadalquivir His diadem his robes and his courser were found on the bank but as the body of the Gothic prince was lost in the waves the pride and ignorance of the caliph must have been gratified with some meaner head which was exposed in triumph before the palace of Da mascus And such continues a valiant historian of the Arabs is the fate of those kings who withdraw themselves from a field of battle 1 Count Julian had plunged so deep into guilt and infamy that his only hope was in the ruin of his country After the battle of Xeres he recommended the most effectual measures to the victorious Saracens The king of the Goths is slain their princes are fled before you the army is routed the nation is astonished Se cure with sufficient detachments the cities of Boetica but in person and without delay march to the royal city of Toledo and allow not the distracted Christians either time or tranquillity for the election of a new monarch Tarik listened to his advice A Roman captive and proselyte who had been enfranchised by the caliph himself assaulted Cordova with seven hundred horse he swam the river surprised the town and drove the Christians into the great church where they defended themselves above three months Another detachment reduced the sea coast of Boetica which in the last period of the Moorish power has comprised in a narrow space the populous kingdom of Grenada The march of Tarik from the Boetus to the Tagus 2 was directed through the Sierra Morena that sepa rates Andalusia and Castille till he appeared in arms under the walls of Tole do 3 The most zealous of the catholics had escaped with the relics of their saints and if the gates were shut it was only till the victor had subscribed a fair and reasonable capitulation The voluntary exiles were allowed to depart with their effects seven churches were appropriated to the Christian worship the archbishop and his clergy were at liberty to exercise their functions the monks to practise or neglect their penance and the Goths and Romans were left in all civil and criminal cases to the subordinate jurisdiction of their own laws and ma gistrates But the justice of Tarik protected the Christians his gratitude and policy rewarded the Jews to whose secret or open aid he was indebted for his most important acquisitions Persecuted by the kings and synods of Spain who had often passed the alternative of banishment or baptism that outcast nation embraced the moment of revenge the comparison of their past and present state was the pledge of their fidelity and the alliance between the disciples of Moses and of Mahomet was maintained till the final era of their common expulsion From the royal seat of Toledo the Arabian leader spread his conquests to the north

of his general Spain which in a more savage and disorderly state had resisted two hundred years the arms of the Romans was overrun in a few months by those of the Saracens and such was the eagerness of submission and treaty that the governor of Cordova is recorded as the only chief who fell without conditions a prisoner into their hands The cause of the Goths had been irrevocably judged in the field of Xeres and in the national dismay each part of the monarchy de clined a contest with the antagonist who had vanquished the united strength of the whole 1 That strength had been wasted by two successive seasons of fa mine and pestilence and the governors who were impatient to surrender might exaggerate the difficulty of collecting the provisions of a siege To disarm the Christians superstition likewise contributed her terrors and the subtle Arab en couraged the report of dreams omens and prophecies and of the portraits of the destined conquerors of Spain that were discovered on breaking open an apartment of the royal palace Yet a spark of the vital flame was still alive some invincible fugitives preferred a life of poverty and freedom in the Asturian valleys the hardy mountaineer repulsed the slaves of the caliph and the sword of Pelagius has been transformed into the sceptre of the catholic kings 2 On the intelligence of this rapid success the applause of Musa degenerated into envy and he began not to complain but to fear that Tarik would leave him no thing to subdue At the head of ten thousand Arabs and eight thousand Africans he passed jver in person from Mauritania to Spain the first of his companions were the noblest of the Koreish his eldest son was left in the command of Africa the three younger brethren were of an age and spirit to second the boldest enter prises of their father At his landing in Algezire he was respectfully entertained by count Julian who stifled his inward remorse and testified both in words and actions that the victory of the Arabs had not impaired his attachment to their cause Some enemies yet remained for the sword of Musa The tardy repent ance of the Goths had compared their own numbers and those of the invaders the cities from which the march of Tarik had declined considered themselves as im pregnable and the bravest patriots defended the fortifications of Seville and Meri da They were successively besieged and reduced by the labour of Musa who transported his camp from the Bonis to the Anas from the Gaudalquiver to the Guadiana When he beheld the works of Roman magnificence the bridge the aqueducts the triumphal arches and the theatre of the ancient metropolis of Lusitania  I should imagine said he to his four companions  that the human race must have united their art and power in the foundation of this city happy is the man who shall become its master He aspired to that happiness but the JEmerilans sustained on this occasion the honour of their descent from the veteran legionaries of Augustus 3 Disdaining the confinement of their walls they gave battle to the Arabs on the plain but an ambuscade rising from the shelter of a quarry or a ruin chastised their indiscretion and intercepted their return The wooden turrets of assault were rolled forwards to the foot of the rampart but the defence of Merida was obstinate and long and the castle of the martyrs was a per petual testimony of the losses of the Moslems The constancy f t the besieged was at length subdued by famine and despair and the prudent victor disguised his impatience under the names of clemency and esteem The alternative of exile or tribute was allowed the churches were divided between the two religions and the wealth of those who had fallen in the siege or retired to Gallicia was confis cated as the reward of the

opened to the vessels of Syria and the Goths were pursued beyond the Pyrenean mountains into their Gallic province of Septimania or Languedoc l In the church of St Mary at Carcassone Musa found but it is improbable that he left seven equestrian statues of massy silver and from his term or column at Narbonne he returned on his footsteps to the Gallician and Lusitanian shores of the ocean During the

children the religion and temples of the Christians that Theodemir shall freely deliver his seven cities Orihuela Valentola Alicant Mola Vacasora Bigerra now Bejars Ora or Opta and Lorca that he shall not assist or entertain the enemies of the caliph but shall faithfully communicate his knowledge of their hostile designs that himself and each of the Gothic nobles shall annually pay one piece of gold four measures of wheat as many of barley with a certain pro portion of honey oil and vinegar and that each of their vassals shall be taxed at one moiety of the said imposition Given the fourth of Regeb in the year of the Hegira ninety four and subscribed with the names of four Mussulman wit nesses 3 Theodemir and his subjects were treated with uncommon lenity but the rate of tribute appears to have fluctuated from a tenth to a fifth according to the submission or obstinacy of the Christians 4 In this revolution many partial calamities were inflicted by the carnal or religious passions of the enthusiasts Some churches were profaned by the new worship some relics or images were confounded with idols the rebels were put to the sword and one town an obscure place between Cordova and Seville was rased to its foundations Yet if we com pare the invasion of Spain by the Goths or its recovery by the kings of Castille and Arragon we must applaud the moderation and discipline of the Arabian con querors The exploits of Musa were performed in the evening of life though he affected to disguise his age by colouring with a red powder the whiteness of his beard But in the love of action and glory his breast was still fired with the ardour of youth and the possession of Spain was considered only as the first step to the mo narchy of Europe With a powerful armament by sea and land he was preparing to repass the Pyrenees to extinguish in Gaul and Italy the declining kingdoms of the Franks and Lombards and to preach the unity of God on the altar of the Va tican From thence

enterprise perhaps of easy execution must have seemed extravagant to vul gar minds and the visionary conqueror was soon reminded of his dependance and servitude The friends of Farik had effectually stated his services and wrongs at the court of Damascus the proceedings of Musa were blamed his intentions were suspected and his delay in complying with the first invitation was chastised by a harsher and more peremptory summons An intrepid messenger of the caliph entered his camp at Lugo in Gallicia and in the presence of the Saracens and Christians arrested the bridle of his horse His own loyalty or that of his troops inculcated the duty of obedience and his disgrace was alleviated by the recall of his rival and the permission of investing with his two governments his two sons Abdallah and Abdelaziz His long triumph from Ceuta to Damascus displayed the spoils of Africa and the treasures of Spain four hundred Gothic nobles with gold coronets and girdles were distinguished in his train and the number of male and female captives selected for their birth or beauty was computed at eighteen or even at thirty thousand persons As soon as he reached Tiberias in Palestine he was apprized of the sickness and danger of the caliph by a private message from Soliman his brother and presumptive heir who wished to reserve for his own reign the spectacle of victory Had Walid recovered the delay of Musa would have been criminal he pursued his march and found an enemy on the throne In his trial before a partial judge against a popular antagonist he was convicted of vanity and falsehood and a fine of two hundred thousand pieces of gold either exhausted his poverty or proved his rapaciousness The unworthy treatment of Tarik was revenged by a similar indignity and the veteran com mander after a public whipping stood a whole day in the sun before the palace gate till he obtained a decent exile under the pious name of a pilgrimage to Mec ca The resentment of the caliph might have been satiated with the ruin of Musa but his fears demanded the extirpation of a potent and injured family A sentence of death was intimated with secrecy and speed to the trusty servants of the throne both in Africa and Spain and the forms if not the substance of jus tice was superseded in this bloody execution In the mosch or palace of Cordova Abdelaziz was slain by the swords of the conspirators they accused their go vernor of claiming the honours of royalty and his scandalous marriage with Egi lona the widow of Roderic offended the prejudices both of the Christians and Moslems By a refinement of cruelty the head of the son was presented to the father with an insulting question whether he acknowledged the features of the rebel   I know his features he exclaimed with indignation  I assert his inno cence and I imprecate the same a juster fate against the authors of his death The age and despair of Musa raised him above the power of kings and he ex pired at Mecca of the anguish of a broken heart His rival was more favourably treated his services were forgiven and Tarik was permitted to mingle with the crowd of slaves 1 I am ignorant whether count Julian was rewarded with the death which he deserved indeed though not from the hands of the Saracens but the tale of their ingratitude to the sons of Witiza is disproved by the most unques tionable evidence The two royal youths were reinstated in the private patri mony of their father but on the decease of Elba the elder his daughter was un justly despoiled of her portion by the violence of her uncle Sigebut The Gothic maid pleaded her cause before the caliph Hasheim and obtained the restitution of her inheritance but she was given in marriage to a noble Arabian and their two sons Isaac and Ibrahim were received in Spain with the consideration that was due to their origin and riches A province was assimilated to the victorious state by the introduction of stran gers and the imitative spirit of the natives and Spain which had been succes sively tinctured with Punic and Roman and Gothic blood imbibed in a few ge nerations the name and manners of the Arabs The first conquerors and the twenty successive lieutenants of the caliphs were attended by a numerous train of civil and military followers who preferred a distant fortune to a narrow home the private and public interest was promoted by the establishment of faithful colo nies and the cities of Spain were proud to commemorate the tribe or country of and to return home by the north and all three are perhaps surpassed by the real and successful enterprise of Hannibal 1 I much rejrretour lost or my iarnorance of two Arabic works of the seventh century a life of Musa and a poem on the exploits of Tarik Of these authentic

fertile seats of Grenada were bestowed on ten thousand horsemen of Syria and Irak the children of the purest and most noble of the Arabian tribes 1 A spirit of emulation sometimes beneficial more fre

cities the climate the soil and the mineral productions of the earth 2 In the space of two centuries the gifts of nature were improved by the agriculture 3 the manufactures and the commerce of an industrious people and the effects of their diligence have been magnified by the idleness of iheir fancy The first of the Ommiades who reigned in Spain so licited the support of the Christians and in his edict of peace and protection he contents himself with a modest imposition of ten thousand ounces of gold ten thousand pounds of silver ten thousand horses as many mules one thousand cui rasses with an equal number of helmets and lances 4 The most powerful of his successors derived from the same kingdom the annual tribute of twelve mil lions and forty five thousand dinars or pieces of gold about six millions of sterling money 5 a sum which in the tenth century most probably surpassed the united revenues of the Christian monarchs His royal seat of Cordova contained six hundred moschs nine hundred baths and two hundred thousand houses he gave laws to eighty cities of the first to three hundred of the second and third order and the fertile banks of the Guadalquiver were adorned with

gra dually multiplied by the education of the infant captives But the millions of Asia tic and African converts who swelled the native band of the faithful Arabs must have been allured rather than

who slept in the cloister were awakened by the trumpet of the Saracens and in the convulsion of the world every member of a new so ciety ascended to the natural level of his capacity and courage The minds of the multitude were tempted by the invisible as well as temporal blessings of the Ara bian prophet and charity will hope that many of his proselytes entertained a se rious conviction of the truth and sanctity of his revelation In the eyes of an in quisitive polytheist it must appear worthy of the human and the divine nature More pure than the system of Zoroaster more liberal than the law of Moses the religion of Mahomet might seem less inconsistent with reason than the creed of mystery and superstition which in the seventh century disgraced the simplicity of the gospel In the extensive provinces of Persia and Africa the national religion has been eradicated by the Mahometan faith The ambiguous theology of the Magi stood alone among the sects of the east but the profane writings of Zoroaster 2 might under the reverend name of Abraham be dexterously connected with the chain of divine revelation Their evil principle the demon Ahriman might be represented as the rival or as the creature of the God of light The temples of Persia were devoid of images but the worship of the sun and of fire might be stigmatized as a gross and criminal idolatry 3 The milder sentiment was con secrated by the practice of Mahomet 4 and the prudence of the caliphs the Ma gians or Ghebers were ranked with the Jews and Christians among the people of the written law 5 and as late as the third century of the Hegira the city of He rat will afford a lively contrast of private zeal and public toleration 6 Under the payment of an annual tribute the Mahometan law secured to the Ghebers of

memorial of time or place of persecution or resistance It was general since the whole realm from Shiraz to Samarcand imbibed the faith of the Koran and the preservation of the native tongue reveals the descent of the Mahometans of Persia 2 In the mountains and deserts an obstinate race of unbelievers adhered to the superstition of their fathers and a faint tradition of the Magian theology is kept alive in the province of Kirman along the banks of the Indus among the exiles of Surat and in the colony which in the last century was planted by Shaw Abbas at the gates of Ispahan The chief pontiff has retired to mount Elbourz eighteen leagues from the city of Yezd the perpetual fire if it continue to burn is inaccessible to the profane but his residence is the school the oracle and the pilgrimage of the Ghebers whose hard and uniform features attest the unmingled purity of their blood Under the jurisdiction of their elders eighty thousand families maintain an innocent and industrious life their subsistence is derived from some curious manu factures and mechanic trades and they cultivate the earth with the fervour of a religious duty Their ignorance withstood the despotism of Shaw Abbas who de manded with threats and tortures the prophetic books of Zoroaster and this ob scure remnant of the Magians is spared by the moderation or contempt of their present sovereigns 3 The northern coast of Africa is the only land in which the light of the gospel after a long and perfect establishment has been totally extinguished The arts which had been taught by Carthage and Rome were involved in a cloud of igno rance the doctrine of Cyprian and Augustin was no longer studied Five hundred episcopal churches were overturned by the hostile fury of the Donatists the Van dals the Moors The zeal and numbers of the clergy declined and the people without discipline or knowledge or hope submissively sunk under the yoke of the Arabian prophet Within fifty years after the expulsion of the Greeks a lieute nant of Africa informed the caliph that the tribute of the infidels was abolished by their conversion 4 and though he sought to disguise his fraud and rebellion his specious pretence was drawn from the rapid and extensive progress of the Maho metan faith In the next age an extraordinary mission of five bishops was de tached from Alexandria to Cairoan They were ordained by the Jacobite patriarch to cherish and revive the dying embers of Christianity S but the interposition of a foreign prelate a stranger to the Latins an enemy to the catholics supposes the decay and dissolution of the African hierarchy It was no longer the time when the successor of St Cyprian at the head of a numerous synod could maintain an equal contest with the ambition of the Roman pontiff In the eleventh century the unfortunate priest who was seated on the ruins of Carthage implored the arms and the protection of the Vatican and he bitterly complains

of Mazarabes l adoptive Arabs was applied to their civil or religious conformity 2 About the middle of the twelfth century the worship of Christ and the succession of pastors were abolished along the coast of Barbary and in the kingdoms of Cordova and Seville of Valentia and Grenada 3 The throne of the Almohades or unitarians was founded on the blindest fanati cism and their extraordinary rigour might be provoked or justified by the recent victories and intolerant zeal of the princess of Sicily and Castille of Arragon and Portugal The faith of the Mozarabes was occasionally revived by the papal mis sionaries and on the landing of Charles V some families of Latin Christians were encouraged to rear their heads at Tunis and Algiers But the seed of the gospel was quickly eradicated and the long province from Tripoli to the Atlantic has lost all memory of the language and religion of Rome 4 After the revolution of eleven centuries the Jews and Christians of the Turkish empire enjoy the liberty of conscience which was granted by the Arabian caliphs During the first age of the conquest they suspected the loyalty of the catholics whose name of Melchites betrayed their secret attachment to the Greek emperor while the Nestorians and Jacobites his inveterate enemies approved themselves the sincere and voluntary friends of the Mahometan government 5 Yet this par tial jealousy was healed

Christians were most worthy of trust in the administration of Persia  The Moslems said he  will abuse their present fortune the Magians regret their fallen greatness and the Jews are impatient for their approaching 7 deliverance But the slaves of despotism are exposed to the alternatives of favour and disgrace The captive churches of the east have been afflicted in every age by the avarice or

enter a mosch or to seduce a Mussulman will not be suffered to escape with impunity In a time however of tranquillity and justice the Christians have never been compelled to renounce the Gospel or to embrace the Koran but the punishment of death is inflicted upon the apostates who have professed and deserted the law of Mahomet The martyrs of Cordova provoked the sentence of the cadhi by the public confession of their inconstancy or their passionate invectives against the person and religion of the prophet 1 At the end of the first century of the Hegira the caliphs were the most potent and absolute monarchs of the globe Their prerogative was not circumscribed either in right or in fact by the power of the nobles the freedom of the commons the privileges of the church the votes of a senate or the memory of a free consti tution The authority of the companions of Mahomet expired with their lives and the chiefs or emirs of the Arabian tribes left behind in the desert the spirit of equality and independence The regal and sacerdotal characters were united in the successors of Mahomet and if the Koran was the rule of their actions they were th supreme judges and interpreters of that divine book They reigned by the right of conquest over the nations of the east to whom the name of liberty was unknown and who were accustomed to applaud in their tyrants the acts of violence and severity that were exercised at their own expense Under the last of the Ommiades the Arabian empire extended two hundred days journey from east to west from the confines of Tartary and India to the shores of the Atlantic ocean And if we retrench the sleeve of the robe as it is styled by their writers the long and narrow province of Africa the solid and compact dominion from Fargana to Aden from

unfold the events that rescued our ancestors of Britain and our neighbours of Gaul from the civil and religious yoke of the Koran ihat protected the majesty of Home and delayed the servitude of Constantinople that invigorated the defence of the Christians and scattered among their enemies the seeds of division and decay Forty six years after the flight of Mahomet from Mecca his disciples appeared in arms under the walls of Constantinople 1 They were animated by a genuine or fictitious saying of the prophet that to the first army which besieged the city of the Csesarsj their sins were forgiven the long series of the Roman triumphs would be meritoriously transferred to the conquerors of new Rome and the wealth of nations was deposited in this well chosen seat of royalty and commerce No sooner had the caliph Moawiyah suppressed his rivals and established his throne than he aspired to expiate the guilt of civil blood by the success and glory of his holy expedition 2 his preparations by sea and land were adequate to the import ance of the object his standard was intrusted to Sophian a veteran warrior but the troops were encouraged by the example and presence of Yezid the son and Sresumptive heir of the commander of the faithful The Greeks had little to ope nor had their enemies any reasons to fear from the courage and vigilance of the reigning emperor who disgraced the name of Constantine and imitated only the inglorious years of his grandfather Heraclius Without delay or opposition the naval forces of the Saracens passed through the unguarded channel of the Hellespont which even now under the feeble and disorderly government of the Turks is maintained as the natural bulwark of the capital 3 The Arabian  fleet cast anchor and the troops were disembarked near the palace of Hebdomcn seven miles from the city During many days from the dawn of light to the eve ning the line of assault was extended from the golden gate to the eastern promon tory and the foremost warriors were impelled by the weight and effort of the suc ceeding columns But the beseigers had formed an insufficient estimate of the strength and resources of Constantinople The solid and lofty walls were guarded by numbers and discipline the spirit of the Romans was rekindled by the last dan ger of their religion and empire the fugitives from the conquered provinces more successfully renewed the defence of Damascus and Alexandria and the Saracens â were dismayed by the strange and prodigious effects of artificial fire This firm and effectual resistance diverted their arms to the more easy attempts of plundering the European and Asiatic coasts of the Propontis and after keeping the sea from the month of April to that of September on the approach of winter they retreated fourscore miles from the capital to the isle of Cyzicus in which they had established their magazine of spoil and provisions So patient was their perseverance or so languid were their operations that they repeated in the six following summers the same attack and retreat with a gradual abatement of hope and vigour till the mischances of shipwreck and disease of the sword and of fire compelled them to relinquish the fruitless enterprise They might bewail the loss or commemo rate the martyrdom of thirty thousand Moslems who fell in the siege of Constan tinople and the solemn

firmest barrier of the empire till they were disarmed and transplanted by the suspicious policy of the Greeks 3 Af ter the revolt of Arabia and Persia the house of Ommiyah 4 was reduced to the kingdoms of Syria and Egypt their distress and fear enforced their compliance with the pressing demands of the Christians and the tribute was increased to a slave a horse and a thousand pieces of gold for each of the three hundred and sixty five days of the solar year But as soon B3 the empire was again united by the arms and policy of Abdalmalek he disclaimed a badge of servitude not less injurious to his conscience than to his pride he discontinued the payment of the tribute and the resentment of the Greeks was disabled from action by the mad tyranny of the second Justinian the just

overspread the provinces of Asia Minor and approached the borders of the By zantine capital But the attempt and disgrace of the second siege was reserved for his brother Soliman whose ambition appears to have been quickened by a more active and martial spirit In the revolutions of the Greek empire after the tyrant Justinian had been punished and avenged an humble secretary Anastasius or Artemius was promoted by chance or merit to the vacant purple He was alarmed by the sound of war and his ambassador returned from Damascus with the tremendous news that the Saracens were preparing an armament by sea and land such as would transcend the experience of the past or the belief of the pre sent age The precautions of Anastasius were not unworthy of his station or of the impending danger He issued a peremptory mandate that all persons who were not provided with the means of subsistence for a three years siege should evacuate the city the public granaries and arsenals were abundantly replenished the walls were restored and strengthened and the engines for casting stones or darts or fire were stationed along the ramparts or in the brigantines of war of which an additional number was hastily constructed To prevent is safer as well as more honourable than to repel an attack and a design was meditated above the usual spirit of the Greeks of burning the naval stores of the enemy the cypress timber that had been hewn in mount Libanus and was piled along the sea shore of Phoenicia for the service of the Egyptian fleet This generous en terprise was defeated by the cowardice or treachery of the troops who in the new language of the empire were styled of the ubseguian theme l They murdered their chief deserted their standard in the isle of Rhodes dispersed themselves over the adjacent continent and deserved pardon or reward by investing with the purple a simple officer of the revenue The name of Theodosius might recom mend him to the senate and people but after some months he sunk into a clois ter and resigned to the firmer hand of Leo the Isaurian the urgent defence of the capital and empire The most formidable of the Saracens Moslemah the brother of the caliph was advancing at the head of one hundred and twenty thou sand Arabs and Persians the greater part mounted on horses or camels and the successful sieges of Tyana Amorium and Pergamus were of sufficient duration to exercise their skill and to elevate their hopes At the well known passage of Abydus on the Hellespont the Mahometan arms were transported for the first time from Asia to Europe From thence wheeling round the Thracian cities of the Propontis Moslemah invested Constantinople on the land side surrounded his camp with a ditch and rampart prepared and planted his engines of assault and declared by words and actions a patient resolution of expecting the return of seed time and harvest should the obstinacy of the besieged prove equal to his own The Greeks would gladly have ransomed their religion and empire by a fine or assessment of a piece of gold on the head of each inhabitant of the city but the liberal offer was rejected with disdain and the presumption of Moslemah was exalted by the speedy approach and invincible force of the navies of Egypt and Syria They are said to have amounted to eighteen hundred ships the num ber betrays their inconsiderable size and of the twenty stout and capacious ves sels whose magnitude impeded their progress each was manned with no more than one hundred heavy armed soldiers This huge armada proceeded on a smooth sea and with a gentle gale towards the mouth of the Bosphorus the sur face of the strait was overshadowed in the language of the Greeks with a moving forest and the same fatal night had been fixed by the Saracen chief for a general assault by sea and land To allure the confidence of the enemy the emperor had thrown aside the chain that usually guarded the entrance of the harbour but while they hesitated whether they should seize the opportunity or apprehend the snare the ministers of destruction were at hand The fireships of the Greeks â were launched against them the Arabs their arms and vessels were involved in the same flames the disorderly fugitives were dashed against each other or overwhelmed in the waves and I no longer find a vestige of the fleet that had threatened to extirpate the Roman name A still more

preparing to lead against Constantinople the remaining ferces of the east The brother of Moslemah was succeeded by a kinsman and an enemy and the throne of an active and able prince was degraded by the useless and pernicious virtues of a bigot While he started and satisfied the scruples of a blind conscience the siege was continued through the winter by the neglect rather than by the resolution of the caliph Omar l The winter proved uncommonly rigorous above a hundred days the ground was covered with deep snow and the natives of the sultry climes of Egypt and Arabia lay torpid and almost lifeless in their frozen camp They revived on the return of spring a second effort had been made in their favour and their distress was relieved by the arrival of two numerous fleets laden with corn and arms and soldiers the first from Alexandria of four hundred transports and galleys the second of the three hundred and sixty vessels from the ports of Africa But the Greek fires were again kindled and if the destruction was less complete it was owing to the expe rience which had taught the Moslems to remain at a safe distance or to the per fidy of the Egyptian mariners who deserted with their ships to the emperor of the Christians The trade and navigation of the capital were restored and the produce of the fisheries supplied the wants and even the luxury of the inha bitants But the calamities of famine and disease were soon felt by the troops of Moslemah and as the former was miserably assuaged so the latter was dread fully propagated by the pernicious nutriment which hunger compelled them to extract from the most unclean or unnatural food The spirit of conquest and even of enthusiasm was extinct the Saracens could no longer straggle beyond their lines either single or in small parties without exposing themselves to the merciless retaliation of the Thracian peasants An army of Bulgarians was at tracted from the Danube by the gifts and promises of Leo and these savage aux iliaries made some atonement for the evils which they had inflicted on the em pire by the defeat and slaughter of twenty two thousand Asiatics A report was dexterously scattered that the Franks the unknown nations of the Latin world were arming by sea and land in the defence of the Christian cause and their for midable aid was expected with far different sensations in the camp and city At length after a siege of thirteen months 2 the hopeless Moslemah received from the caliph the welcome permission of retreat The march of the Arabian cavalry over the Hellespont and through the provinces of Asia was executed without de lay or molestation but an army of their brethren had been cut in pieces on the side of Bithynia and the remains of the fleet were so repeatedly damaged by tem pest and fire that only five galleys entered the port of Alexandria to relate the tale of their various and almost incredible disasters 3 In the two sieges the deliverance of Constantinople may be chiefly ascribed to the novelty the terrors and the real efficacy of the GreekJire A The import ant secret of compounding and directing this artificial flame was imparted by Calli nicus a native of Heliopolis in Syria who deserted from the service of the caliph to that of the emperor 5 The skill of a chemist and engineer was equivalent to the succour of fleets and armies and this discovery or

Syf composition should suspect his own ignorance and that of his Byzantine guides so prone to the marvellous so careless and in this instance so jealous of the truth From their obscure and perhaps fallacious hints it should seem that the principal ingredient of the Greek fire was the nafitha l or liquid bitumen a light tena cious and inflammable oil 2 which springs from the earth and catches fire as soon as it comes in contact with the air The naptha was mingled I know not by what methods or in what proportions with sulphur and with the pitch that is ex tracted from evergreen firs 3 From this mixture which produces a thick smoke and a loud explosion proceeded a fierce and obstinate flame which not only rose in perpendicular ascent but likewise burnt with equal vehemence in descent or lateral progress instead of being extinguished it was nourished and quickened by the element of water and sand urine or vinegar were the only remedies that could damp the fury of this powerful agent which was justly denominated by the Greeks the liquid or the maritime fire For the annoyance of the enemy it was employed with equal effect by sea and land in battles or in sieges 1 It was either poured from the ramparts in large boilers or launched in red hot balls of stone and iron or darted in arrows and javelins twisted round with flax and tow which had deeply imbibed the inflammable oil sometimes it was deposited in fire ships the victims and instruments of a more ample revenge and was most commonly blown through long tubes of copper which were planted on the prow of a galley and fancifully shaped into the mouths of savage monsters that seemed to vomit a stream of liquid and consuming fire This important art was preserved at Con stantinople as the palladium of the state the galleys and artillery might occa sionally be lent to the allies of Rome but the composition of the Greek fire was concealed with the most jealous scruple and the terror of the enemies was in creased and prolonged by their ignorance and surprise In the treatise of the ad ministration of the empire the royal author 4 suggests the answers and excuses that might best elude the indiscreet curiosity and importunate demands of the bar barians They should be told that the mystery of the Greek fire had been re vealed by an angel to the first and greatest of the Constantines with a sacred in junction that this gift of heaven this peculiar blessing of the Romans should never be communicated to any foreign nation that the prince and subject were alike bound to religious silence under the temporal and spiritual penalties of trea son and sacrilege and that the impious attempt would provoke the sudden and su pernatural vengeance of the God of the Christians By these precautions the se cret was confined above four hundred years to the Romans of the east and at the end of the eleventh century the Pisans to whom every art was familiar suf fered the effects without understanding the composition of the Greek fire It was at length either discovered or stolen by the Mahometans and in the holy wars of Syria and Egypt they retorted an invention contrived against themselves on the heads of the Christians A knight who despised the swords and lances of the Saracens relates with heartfelt sincerity his own fears and those of his compa nions at the sight and sound of the mischievous engine that discharged a torrent of the Greek fire the feu Gregeois as it is styled by the more early of the French writers It came flying through the air says Joinville 5 like a winged long tailed dragon about

new revolution in the art of war and the history of mankind 2 Constantinople and the Greek fire might exclude the Arabs from the eastern entrance of Europe but in the west on the side of the Pyrenees the provinces of Gaul were threatened and invaded by the conquerors of Spain 3 The de cline of the French monarchy invited the attack of these insatiate fanatics The descendants of Clovis had lost the inheritance of his martial and ferocious spirit and their misfortune or demerit has affixed the epithet of lazy to the last kings of the Merovingian race 4 They ascended the throne without power and sunk into the grave without a name A country palace in the neighbourhood of Com piegne 5 was allotted for their residence or prison but each year in the month of March or May they were conducted in a wagon drawn by oxen to the assem bly of the Franks to give audience to foreign ambassadors and to ratify the acts of the mayor of the palace That domestic officer was become the minister of the nation and the master of the prince A public employment was converted into the patrimony of a private family the elder Pepin left a king of mature years under the guardianship of his own widow and her child and these feeble regents were forcibly dispossessed by the most active of his bastards A govern ment half savage and half corrupt was almost dissolved and the tributary dukes the provincial counts and the territorial lords were tempted to despise the weakness of the monarch and to imitate the ambition of the mayor Among these independent chiefs one of the boldest and most successful was Eudes duke of Aquitain who in the southern provinces of Gaul usurped the authority and even the title of king The Goths the Gascons and the Franks assembled un der the standard of this Christian hero he repelled the first invasion of the Sa racens and Zema lieutenant of the caliph lost his army and his life under the walls of Thoulouse The ambition of his successors was stimulated by revenge they repassed the Pyrenees with the means and the resolution of conquest The advantageous situation which had recommended Narbonne 6 as the first Roman colony was again chosen by the Moslems they claimed the province of Septe maniaor Languedoc as a just dependence of the Spanish monarchy the vine yards of Gascony and the city of Bordeaux were possessed by the sovereign of Damascus and Samarcand and the south of France from the mouth of the Ga ronne to that of the Rhone assumed the manners and religion of Arabia But these narrow limits were scorned by the spirit of Abdalrahman or Abde rame who had been

chief had accepted the alliance of the duke of Aquitain and Eudes from a motive of private or public interest devoted his beauteous daughter to the embraces of the African misbeliever But the strong est fortresses of Cerdagne were invested by a superior force the rebel was over taken and slain in the mountains and his widow was sent a captive to Damascus to gratify the desires or more probably the vanity of the commander of the faith ful From the Pyrenees Abderame preceeded without delay to the passage of the Rhone and the siege of Aries An army of Christians attempted the relief of the city the tombs of their leaders were yet visible in the thirteenth century and many thousands of their dead bodies were carried down the rapid stream into the Mediterranean sea The arms of Abderame were not less successful on the side of the ocean He passed without opposition the Garonne and Dordogne which unite their waters in the gulf of Bordeaux but he found beyond those rivers the camp of the intrepid Eudes who had formed a second army and sus tained a second defeat so fatal to the Christians that according to their sad con fession God alone could reckon the number of the slain The victorious Saracen overran the provinces of Aquitain whose Gallic names are disguised rather than lost in the modern appellations of Perigord Saintogne and Poitou his standards were planted on the walls or at least before the gates of Tours and of Sens and his detachments overspread the kingdom of Burgundy as far as the well known cities of Lyons and Besaneon The memory of these devastations for Abderame did not spare the country or the people was long preserved by tradition and the in vasion of France by the Moors or Mahometans affords the ground work of those fables which have been so wildly disfigured in the romance of chivalry and so elegantly adorned by the Italian muse In the decline of society and art the de serted cities could supply a slender booty to the Saracens their richest spoil was found in the churches and monasteries which they stripped of their ornaments and delivered to the flames and the tutelar saints both Hilary of Poitiers and Martin of Tours forgot their miraculous powers in the defence of their own se pulchres 1 A victorious line of march had been prolonged above a thousand miles from the rock of Gibraltar to the banks of the Loire the repetition of an equal space would have carried the Saracens to the confines of Poland and the Highlands of Scotland the Rhine is not more impassable than the Nile or Eu phrates and the Arabian fleet might have sailed without a naval combat into the mouth of the Thames Perhaps the interpretation of the Koran would now be taught in the schools of Oxford and her pulpits might demonstrate to a circum cised people the sanctity and truth of the revelation of Mahomet 2 From such calamities was Christendom delivered by the genius and fortune of one man Charles the illegitimate son of the elder Pepin was content with the title of mayor or duke of the Franks but he deserved to become the father of a line of kings In a laborious administration of twenty four years he restored and support ed the dignity of the throne and the rebels of Germany and Gaul were successive ly crushed by the activity of a warrior who in the same campaign could display Iris banner on the Elbe the Rhone and the shores of the ocean In the public dan ger he was summoned by the voice of his country and his rival the duke of Aqui tain was reduced to appear among the fugitives and suppliants  Alas exclaimed the Franks

possession of wealth will divide their counsels and assure your victory This subtle policy is perhaps a refinement of the Arabian writers and the situation of Charles will suggest a more narrow and

and reluctant A standing army was unknown under the first and second race more than half the kingdom was now in the hands of the Saracens according to their respective situations the Franks of Neustria and Austrasia were too conscious or too careless of the impending danger and the vo luntary aids of the Gepidsc and Germans were separated by a long interval from the standard of the Christian general No sooner had he collected his forces than he sought and found the enemy in the centre of France between Tours and Poi tiers His well conducted march was covered by a range of hills and Abderame appears to have been surprised by his unexpected presence The nations of Asia Africa and Europe advanced with equal ardour to an encounter which would change the history of the world In the six first days of desultory combat the horsemen and archers of the east maintained their advantage but in the closer onset of the seventh day the orientals were oppressed by the strength and stature of the Germans who with stout hearts and iron hands l asserted the civil and religious freedom of their posterity The epithet of Martel the Hammer which has been added to the name of Charles is expressive of his weighty and irresisti ble strokes the valour of Eudes was excited by resentment and emulation and their companions in the eye of history are the true peers and paladins of French chivalry After a bloody field in which Abderame was slain the Saracens in the close of the evening retired to their camp In the disorder and despair of the night the various tribes of Yemen and Damascus of Africa and Spain were provoked to turn their arms against each other the remains of their host were suddenly dis solved and each emir consulted his safety by a hasty and separate retreat At the dawn of day the stillness of a hostile camp was suspected by the victorious Chris tians on the report of their spies they ventured to explore the riches of the va cant tents but if we except some celebrated relics a small portion of the spoil was restored to the innocent and lawful owners The joyful tidings were soon dif fused over the catholic world and the monks of Italy could affirm and believe that three hundred and fifty or three hundred and seventy five thousand of the Ma hometans had been crushed by the hammer of Charles 2 while no more than fifteen hundred Christians were slain in the field of Tours But this incredible tale is sufficiently disproved by the caution of the French general who apprehended the snares and accidents of a pursuit and dismissed his German allies to their na tive forests The inactivity of a conqueror betrays the loss of strength and blood and the most cruel execution is inflicted not in the ranks of battle but on the backs of a flying enemy Yet the victory of the Franks was complete and final Aqui tain was recovered by the arms of Eudes the Arabs never resumed the conquest of Gaul and they were soon driven beyond the Pyrenees by Charles Martel and his valiant race 3 It might have been expected that the saviour of Christendom would have been canonized or at least applauded by the gratitude of the clergy who are indebted to his sword for their present existence But in the public dis tress the mayor of the palace had been compelled to apply the riches or at least the revenues of the bishops and abbots to the relief of the state and the reward of the soldiers His merits were forgotten his sacrilege alone was remembered and in an epistle to a Carlovingian prince a Gallic synod presumes to declare that his ancestor was damned that on the opening of his tomb the spectators were affrighted by a smell of fire and the aspect of a horrid dragon and that a saint of  Gens Austria membrorum pre cminentia valida el gens

wishes of the faithful were turned towards the line of Hashem and the kindred of the apostle of God Of these the Fatimites were either rash or pusillanimous but the descendants of Abbas cherished with courage and discretion the hopes of their rising fortunes From an obscure residence in Syria they secretly despatched their agents and missionaries who preached in the eastern provinces their hereditary indefeasible right and Mohammed the son of Ali the son of Abdallah the son of Abbas the uncle of the prophet gave audience to the deputies of Chorasan and accepted their free gift of four hundred thousand pieces of gold After the death of Mohammed the oath of allegiance was adminis tered in the name of his son Ibrahim to a numerous band of votaries who expected only a signal and a leader and the governor of Chorasan continued to deplore his fruitless admonitions and the deadly slumber of the caliphs of Damascus till he himself with all his adherents was driven from the city and palace of Meru by the rebellious arms of Abu Moslem 2 That maker of kings the author as he is named of the call of the Abbasides was at length rewarded for his presumption of merit with the usual gratitude of courts A mean perhaps a foreign extraction could not repress the aspiring energy of Abu Moslem Jealous of his wives liberal of his wealth prodigal of his own blood and of that of others he could boast with pleasure and possibly with truth that he had destroyed six hundred thousand of his enemies and such was the intrepid gravity of his mind and countenance that he was never seen to smile except on a day of battle In the visible separation of parties the green was consecrated to the Fatimites the Ommiades were di in fuished by the white and the black as the most adverse was

their allegorical names of the night and the sha dow obscurely represented the indissoluble union and perpetual succession of the line of Hashem From the Indus to the Euphrates the east was convulsed by the quarrel of the white and the black factions the Abbassides were most fre quently victorious but their public success was clouded by the personal misfortune of their chief The court of Damascus awakening from a long slumber resolved to prevent the pilgrimage of Mecca which Ibrahim had undertaken with a splen did retinue to recommend himself at once to the favour of the prophet and of the people A detachment of cavalry intercepted his march and arrested his person and the unhappy Ibrahim snatched away from the promise of untasted royalty expired in iron fetters in the dungeons of Haran His two younger brothers Saffah and Almansor eluded the search of the tyrant and lay concealed at Cufa till the zeal of the people and the approach of his eastern friends allowed them to expose their persons to the impatient public On Friday in the dress of a caliph in the colours of the sect Saffah proceeded with religious and military pomp to the mosch ascending the pulpit he prayed and preached as the lawful successor of Mahomet and after his departure his kinsmen bound a willing people by an oath of fidelity But it was on the banks of the Zab and not in the mosch of Cufa that this important

the remains of the white faction were finally vanquished in Egypt and the lance which terminated the life and_ anxiety of Mervan was not less welcome perhaps to the unfortunate than to the victorious chief The merciless inquisition of the conqueror eradicated the most distant branches of the hostile race their bones were scattered their memory was ac cursed and the martyrdom of Hossein was abundantly revenged cn the posterity of his tyrants Fourscore of the Ommiades who had yielded to the faith or cle mency of their foes were invited to a banquet at Damascus The laws of hospi tality were violated by a promiscuous massacre the board was spread over their fallen bodies and the festivity of the guests was enlivened by the music of their dying groans By the event of the civil war the dynasty of the Abbassides was firmly established but the Christians only could triumph in the mutual hatred and common loss of the disciples of Mahomet 3 Yet the thousands who were swept away by the sword of war might have been speedily retrieved in the succeeding generation if the consequences of the revolution had not tended to dissolve the power and unity of the empire of the Saracens In the proscription of the Ommiades a royal youth of the name of Abdalrahman alone escaped the rage of his enemies who hunted the wandering exile from the brinks of the Euphrates to the valleys of mount Atlas Hispresence in the neigh bourhood of Spain revived the zeal of the white faction The name and cause of the Abbassides had been first vindicated by the Persians the west had been pure from civil arms and the servants of the abdicated family still held by a pre carious tenure the inheritance of their lands and the offices of government Strongly prompted by gratitude indignation and fear they invited the grandson of the caliph Hashem to ascend the throne of his ancestors and in his desperate condition the extremes of rashness and prudence were almost the same The ac clamation of the people saluted his landing on the coast of Andalusia and after a successful struggle Abdalrahman established the throne of Cordova and was the father of the Ommiades of Spain who reigned above two hundred and fifty years from the Atlantic to the Pyrenees 4 He slew in battle a lieutenant of the Ab bassides who had invaded his dominions with a fleet and army the head of Ala in salt and camphire was

without effect but instead of opening a door to the conquest of Europe Spain was dissevered from the trunk of the monarchy engaged in perpetual hostility with the east and inclined to peace and friendship with the Christian sovereigns of Constantinople and France The example of the Ommiades was imitated by the real or fictitious progeny of Ali the Edrissites of Mauritania and the m6re powerful Fatimites of Africa and Egypt In the tenth century the chair of Mahomet was disputed by three caliphs or commanders of the faithful who reigned at Bagdad Cairoan and Cordova excommunicated each other and agreed only in a principle of discord that a secretary is more odious and criminal than an unbeliever 1 Mecca was the patrimony of the line of Hashem yet the Abbassides were never tempted to reside either in the birth place or the city of the prophet Da mascus was disgraced by the choice and polluted with the blood of the Om miades and after some hesitation Almansor the brother and successor of Saffah laid the foundations of Bagdad 2 the imperial seat of his prosperity during a reign of five hundred years 3 The chosen spot is on the eastern bank of the Tigris about fifteen miles above the ruins of Modain the double wall was of a cir cular form and such was the rapid increase of a capital now dwindled to a pro vincial town that the funeral of a popular saint might be attended by eight hun dred thousand men and sixty thousand women of Bagdad and the adjacent vil lages In this city of fieace 4 amidst the riches of the east the Abbassides soon disdained the abstinence and frugality of the first caliphs and aspired to emulate the magnificence of the Persian kings After his wars and buildings Almansor left behind him in gold and silver about thirty millions sterling 5 and this trea sure was exhausted in a few years by the vices or virtues of his children His son Mahadi in a single pilgrimage to Mecca expended six millions of dinars of gold A pious and charitable motive may sanctify the foundation of cisterns and cara vanseras which he distributed along a measured road of seven hundred miles but his train of camels laden with snow could serve only to astonish the natives of Arabia and to refresh the fruits and liquors of the royal banquet 6 The cour tiers would surely praise the liberality of his grandson Almamon who gave away four fifths of the income of a province a sum of two millions four hundred thou sand gold dinars before he drew his foot from the stirrup At the nuptials of the same prince a thousand pearls of the largest

pro gress of the Arabian empire Temporal and spiritual conquests had been the sole occupation of the first successors of Mahomet and after supplying themselves with the necessaries of life the whole revenue was scrupulously devoted to that salutary work The Abbassides were impoverished by the multitude of their wants and their contempt of economy Instead of pursuing the great object of ambition

in the tranquillity of do mestic life War was no longer the passion of the Saracens and the increase of pay the repetition of donatives were insufficient to allure the posterity of those voluntary champions who had crowded to the standard of Abubeker and Omar for the hopes of spoil and of paradise Under the reign of the Ommiades the studies of the Moslems were confined to the interpretation of the Koran and the eloquence and poetry of their native tongue A people continually exposed to the dangers of the field must esteem the healing powers of medicine or rather of surgery but the starving physicians of Arabia murmured a complaint that exercise and temperance deprived them of the greatest part of their practice 1 After their civil and domestic wars the subjects of the Abbassides awakening from this mental lethargy found leisure and felt curiosity for the acquisition of profane science This spirit was first en couraged by the caliph Almansor who besides his knowledge of the Mahometan law had applied himself with success to the study of astronomy But when the sceptre devolved to Almamon the seventh of the Abbassides he completed the  designs of his grandfather and invited the Muses from their ancient seats His ambassadors at Constantinople his agents in Armenia Syria and Egypt collected the volumes of the Grecian science at his command they were translated by the most skilful interpreters into the Arabic language his subjects were exhorted as siduously to peruse these instructive writings and the successor of Mahomet as sisted with pleasure and modesty at the assemblies and disputations of the learned  He was not ignorant says Abulpharagius  that they are the elect of God his best and most useful servants whose lives are devoted to the improvement of their

inferior to the vigour of the grossest and most sordid of the quadrupeds The teachers of wisdom are the true luminaries and legislators ot a world which without their aid would again sink in ignorance and barbarism 3 The zeal and curiosity of Almamon were imitated by succeeding princes of the line of Ab bas their rivals the Fatimites of Africa and the Ommiades of Spain were the patrons of the learned as well as the commanders of the faithful the same royal prerogative was claimed by their independent emirs of the provinces and their emulation diffused the taste and the rewards of science from Samarcand and Bochara to Fez and Cordova The vizier of a sultan consecrated a sum of two hundred thousand pieces of gold to the foundation of a college at Bagdad which he en dowed with an annual revenue of fifteen thousand dinars The fruits of instruc tion were communicated perhaps at different times to six thousand disciples of every degree from the son of the noble to that of the mechanic a sufficient al lowance was provided for the indigent scholars and the merit or industry of the professors was repaid with adequate stipends In every city the productions of Arabic literature were copied and collected by the curiosity of the studious and the vanity of the rich A private doctor refused the invitation of the sultan of Bochara because the carriage of his books would have required four hundred camels The royal library of the Fatimites consisted of one hundred thousand manuscripts elegantly transcribed and splendidly bound which were lent with out jealousy or avarice to the

till the great irruption of the Moguls and was coeval with the darkest and most slothful period of Eu ropean annals but since the sun of science has arisen in the west it should seem that the oriental studies have languished and declined 1 In the libraries of the Arabians as in those of Europe the far greater part ot the innumerable volumes were possessed only of local value or imaginary merit 2 The shelves were Crowded with orators and poets whose style was adapted to the taste and manners of their countrymen with general and partial histories which each revolving generation supplied with a new harvest of persons and events with codes and commentaries of jurisprudence which derived their au thority from the law of the prophet with the interpreters of the Koran and or thodox tradition and with the whole theological tribe polemics mystics scho lastics and moralists the first or the last of writers according to the different esti mate of sceptics or believers The works of speculation or

original have been recovered in the versions of the east 3 v hich possessed and studied the writings of Aristotle and Plato of Euclid and Apollonius of Ptolemy Hippocrates and Galen 4 Among the ideal systems which have varied with the fashion of the times the Arabians adopted the philo sophy of the Stagirite alike intelligible or alike obscure for the readers of every age Plato wrote for the Athenians and his allegorical genius is too closely blended with the language and religion of Greece After the fall of that religion the Pe ripatetics emerging from their obscurity prevailed in the controversies of the oriental sects and their founder was long afterward restored by the Mahometans of Spain to the Latin schools 5 The physics both of the Academy and the Ly exum as they are built not on observation but on argument have retarded the progress of real knowledge The metaphysics of infinite or finite spirit have too often been enlisted in the service of superstition But the human faculties are for tified by the art and practice of dialectics the ten predicaments of Aristotle col lect and methodize our ideas 6 and his syllogism is the keenest weapon of dis pute It was dexterously wielded in the schools of the Saracens but as it is more effectual for the detection of error than for the investigation of truth it is not sur prising that new generations of masters and disciples should still revolve in the same circle of logical argument The mathematics are distinguished by a pecu liar privilege that in the course of ages they may always advance and can ne ver

inquiry and toleration and encouraged the Arabian sages to suspect that their caliph was a tyrant and their prophet an impostor 3 The instinct of superstition was alarmed by the introduction even of the abstract sci ences and the more rigid doctors of the law condemned the rash and pernicious curiosity of Almamon 4 To the thirst of martyrdom the vision of paradise and the belief of predestination we must ascribe the invincible enthusiasm of the prince and people And the sword of the Saracens became less formidable when their youth was drawn away from the camp to the college when the armies of the faithful presumed to read and to reflect Yet the foolish vanity of the Greeks was jealous of their studies and reluctantly imparted the sacred fire to the barbarians of the east 5 In the bloody conflict of the Ommiades and Abbassides the Greeks had stolen the opportunity of avenging their wrongs and enlarging their limits But a severe retribution was enacted by Mohadi the third caliph of the new dynasty whoseized Jn his turn the favourable opportunity while a woman and a child Irene and Con stantine were seated on the Byzantine throne An army of ninety five thousand Persians and Arabs was

Barmecides yet he could listen to the complaint of a poor widow who had been pillaged by his troops and who dared in a passage of the Koran to threaten the inattentive despot with the judgment of God and posterity His court was adorned with luxury and science but in a reign of three and twenty years Harun repeatedly visited his provinces from Chorasan to Egypt nine times he performed the pilgrimage of Mecca eight times he inTaded the ter ritories of the Romans and as often as they declined the payment of the tribute they were taught to feel that a month of depredation was more costly than a year of submission But when the unnatural mother of Constantine was deposed and banished her successor Nicephorus resolved to obliterate this badge of servitude and disgrace The epistle of the emperor to the caliph was pointed with an allu sion to the game of chess which had already Bpread from Persia to Greece  The queen he spoke of Irene  considered you as a rook and herself a pawn That pusillanimous female submitted to pay a tribute the double of which she ought to nave evicted from the barbarians Restore therefore the fruits of your injustice or abide the determination of the sword At these words the ambassadors cast a bundle of swords before the foot of the throne The caliph smiled at the menace and drawing his scimitar samaamcih a weapon of historic or fabulous renown he cut asunder the feeble arms of the Greeks without turning the edge or endanger ing the temper of his blade He then dictated an epistle of tremendous brevity In the name of the most merciful God Harun al

of the campaign to his favourite palace of Racca on the Euphrates l but the distance of five hun dred miles and the inclemency of the season encouraged his adversary to violate the peace Nicephorus was astonished by the bold and rapid march of the com mander of the faithful who repassed in the depth of winter the snows of mount Taurus his stratagems of policy and war were exhausted and the perfidious Greek escaped with three wounds from a field of battle overspread with forty thousand of his subjects Yet the emperor was ashamed of submission and the caliph was resolved on victory One hundred and thirty five thousand regular soldiers received pay and were inscribed in the military roll and above three hun dred thousand persons of every denomination marched under the black standard of the Abbassides They swept the surface of Asia Minor far beyond Tyana and Ancyra and invested the Pontic Heraclea 2 once a flourishing state now a pal try town at that time capable of sustaining in her antique walls a month s siege against the forces of the east The ruin was complete the spoil was ample but if Harun had been conversant with Grecian story he would have regretted the statue of Herculus whose attributes the club the bow the quiver and the lion s hide were sculptured in massy gold The progress of desolation by sea and land from the Euxine to the isle of Cyprus compelled the emperor Nicephorus to re tract his haughty defiance In the new treaty the ruins of Heraclea were left fov ever as a lesson and a trophy and the coin of the tribute was marked with the image and superscription of Harun and his three sons 3 Yet this plurality of lords might contribute to remove the dishonour of the Roman name After the death of their father the heirs of the ealiph were

but it has not been overlooked by the Byzantine historians who now begin to cast a clearer light on the affairs of their own times 2 A band of Andalusian volunteers discontented with the climate or government of Spain explored the adventures of the sea but as they sailed in no more than ten or twenty galleys their warfare must be branded with the name of piracy As the subjects and secretaries of the white party they might lawfully invade the domi nions of the black caliphs A rebellious faction introduced them into Alexandria S they cut in pieces both friends and foes pillaged the churches and the moschs sold above six thousand Christian captives and maintained their station in the capital of Egypt till they were oppressed by the forces and the presence of Al mamon himself From the mouth of the Nile to the Hellespont the islands and sea coasts both of the Greeks and Moslems were exposed to their depredations they saw they envied they tasted the fertility of Crete and soon returned with forty galleys to a more serious attack The Andalusians wandered over the land fearless and unmolested but when they descended with their plunder to the sea shore their vessels were in flames and their chief Abu Caab confessed himself the author of the mischief Their clamours accused His madness or treachery Of what do you complain replied the crafty emir I have brought you to a land flowing with milk and honey Here is your true country repose from your toils and forget the barren place of your nativity â And our wives and children â Your beauteous captives will supply the place of your wives and in their em braces you will soon become the fathers of a new progeny The first habitation was their camp with a ditch and rampart in the bay of Suda but an apostate monk led them to a more desirable position in the eastern parts and the name of Candax their fortress and colony has been extended to the whole island under the corrupt and modern appellation of Candia The hundred cities of the age of Minos were diminished to thirty and of these only one most probably Cydonia had courage to retain the substance of freedom and the profession of Christianity The Saracens of Crete soon repaired the loss of their navy and the timbers of mount Ida were launched into the main During a hostile period of one hundred and thirty eight years the princes of Constantinople attacked these licentious corsairs with fruitless curses and ineffectual arms â The loss of Sicily 4 was occasioned by an act of superstitious rigour An amorous youth who had stolen a nun from her cloister was sentenced by the em peror to the amputation of his tongue Euphemius appealed to the reason and policy of the Saracens of Africa and soon returned with the imperial purple a fleet of one hundred ships and an army of seven hundred horse and ten thousand foot They landed at Mazara near the ruins of the ancient Selinus but after some partial victories Syracuse 5 was delivered by the Greeks the apostate was slain before her walls and his African friends were reduced to the necessity of feeding on the flesh of their own horses In their turn they were relieved by a powerful re enforcement of their brethren of Andalusia the largest and western part of the island was gradually reduced and the commodious harbour of Palermo was chosen for the seat of the naval and military power of the

of the cathedral weighed five thousand pounds ofrsilver the entire spoil was computed at one million of pieces of gold about four hundred thousand pounds sterling and the captives must outnumber the seventeen thousand Christians who were transported from the sack of Tauromenium into African servitude In Sicily the religion and lan guage of the Greeks were eradicated and such was the docility of the rising gene ration that fifteen thousand boys were circumcised and clothed on the same day with the son of the Fatimite caliph The Arabian squadrons issued from the har bours of Palermo Biserta and Tunis a hundred and fifty towns of Calabria and Campania were attacked and pillaged nor could the suburbs of Rome be defended by the name of the Cscsars and apostles Had the Mahometans been united Italy must have fallen an easy and glorious accession to the empire of the prophet But the caliphs of Bagdad had lost their authority in the west the Aglabites and Fati mites usurped the provinces of Africa their emirs of Sicily aspired to indepen dence and the design of conquest and dominion was degraded to a repetition of predatory inroads 2 In the sufferings of prostrate Italy the name of Rome awakens a solemn and mournful recollection A fleet of Saracens from the African coast presumed to enter the mouth of the Tiber and to approach a city which even yet in her fallen state was revered as the metropolis of the Christian world The gates and ram parts were guarded by a trembling people but the tombs and temples of St Peter and St Paul were left exposed in the suburbs of the Vatican and of the Ostian way Their invisible sanctity had protected them against the Goths the Vandals and the Lombards but the Arabs disdained both the gospel and the legend and their rapacious spirit was approved and animated by the precepts of the Koran The Christian idols were stripped of their costly offerings a silver altar was torn away from the shrine of St Peter and if the bodies or the buildings were left en tire their deliverance must be imputed to the haste rather than the scruples of the Saracens In their course along the Appian way they pillaged Fundi and be sieged Gayeta but they had turned aside from the walls of Rome and by their divisions the capitol was saved from the yoke of the prophet of Mecca The same danger still impended on the heads of the Roman people and their domestic force was unequal to the assault of an African emir They claimed the protection of their Latin sovereign but the Carlovingian standard was overthrown by a detach ment of the barbarians they meditated the restoration of the Greek emperors but the attempt was treasonable and the succour remote and precarious 3 Their distress appeared to receive some aggravation from the death of their

multitude The public defence had been long neglected not from the presumption of peace but from the distress and poverty of the times As far as the scantiness of his means and the shortness of his leisure would allow the ancient walls were repaired by the command of Leo fifteen towers in the most accessible stations were built or renewed two of these commanded on either side the Tiber and an iron chain was drawn across the stream to impede the as cent of a hostile navy The Romans were assured of a short respite by the wel come news that the siege of Gayeta had been raised and that a part of the enemy with their sacrilegious plunder had perished in the waves But the storm which had been delayed soon burst upan them with redoubled Violence The Aglabite l who reigned in Africa had inherited from his father a treasure and an army a fleet of Arabs and Moors after a short refreshment in the harbours of Sardinia cast anchor before the mouth of the Tiber sixteen miles from the city and their discipline and numbers appeared to threaten not a tran sient inroad but a serious design of conquest and dominion But the vigilance of Leo had formed an alliance with the vassals of the Greek empire the free and maritime states of Gayeta Naples and Amalfi and in the hour of danger their gallevs appeared in the port of Ostia under the command of CÂ esarius the son of the Neapolitan duke a noble and valiant youth who had already vanquished the fleets of the Saracens With his principal companions Caesarius was invited to the Lateran palace and the dexterous pontiff affected to inquire their errand and to accept with joy and surprise their providential succour The city bands in  arms attended their father to Ostia where he reviewed and blessed his generous deliverers They kissed his feet receive4 the communion with martial devotion and listened to the prayer of Leo that the same God who had supported St Peter and St Paul on the waves of the sea would strengthen the hands of his cham pions against the adversaries of his holy name After a similar prayer and with equal resolution the Moslems advanced to the attack of the Christian galleys which preserved their advantageous station along the coast The victory inclined toythe side of the allies when it was less gloriously decided in their favour by a sudden tempest which confounded the skill and courage of the stoutest mariners The Christians were sheltered in a friendly harbour while the Africans were scattered and dashed in pieces among the rocks and islands of a hostile shore Those who escaped from shipwreck and hunger neither found nor deserved mercy at the hands of their implacable pursuers The sword and the gibbet reduced the dangerous multitude of captives and the remainder was more usefully employed to restore the sacred edifices which they had attempted to subvert  The pontiff at the head of the citizens and allies paid his grateful devotion at the shrines of the apostles and among the spoils of this naval victory thirteen Arabian bows of pure and massy silver were suspended round the altar of the fishermen of Galilee The reign of Leo the Fourth was employed in the defence and ornament of the Roman state The churches were renewed and embellished near four thousand pounds of silver were consecrated to repair the losses of St Peter and his sanctu ary was decorated with a plate of gold the weight of two hundred and sixteen pounds embossed with the portraits of the pope and emperor and encircled with a string of pearls Yet this vain magnificence reflects less glory on the character of Leo than the paternal care with which he rebuilt the walls of Horta and Arae ria and transported the wandering inhabitants of Centunicella to his new founda tion of Leopolis twelve miles from the sea shore 2 By his liberality a colony of Corsicans with their wives and children was planted in the station of Porto at the mouth of the Tiber the falling city was restored for their use the fields and vine yards were divided among the new settlers their first efforts were assisted by a gift of horses and cattle and the hardy exiles who breathed revenge against the Saracens swore to live and die under the standard of St Peter The nations of the west and north who visited the threshold of the apostles had gradually formed the large and populous suburb of the Vatican and their various habitations were distinguished in the language of the times as the schools of the Greeks and Goths of the Lombards and Saxons But this venerable spot was still open to sacrilegious 1 De

dedication was tempered with Christian penance and humility The boundary was trod by the bishop and his clergy barefoot in sackcloth and ashes the songs of triumph were modulated to psalms and

middle age In offensive or defensive war he marched in person five times against the Saracens formidable in his attack esteemed by the enemy in his losses and de feats In the last of these expeditions he penetrated into Syria and beseiged the obscure town of Sozopetra the casual birth place of the caliph Motassem whose father Harun was attended in peace and war by the most favourite of his wives and concubines The revolt of a Persian impostor employed at that moment the arms of the Saracen and he could only intercede in favour of a place for which he felt and acknowledged some degree of filial affection These solicitations deter mined the emperor to wound his pride in so sensible a part Sozopetra was le velled with the ground the Syrian prisoners were marked or mutilated with ig nominious cruelty and a thousand female captives were forced away from the ad jacent territory Among these a matron of the house of Abbas invoked in an agony of despair the name of Motassem and the insults of the Greeks engaged the honour of her kinsman to avenge his indignity and to answer her appeal Un der the reign of the two elder brothers the inheritance of the youngest had been confined to Anatolia Armenia Georgia and Circassia this frontier station had exercised his military talents and among his accidental claims to the name of Octonary 2 the most meritorious are the eight battles which he gained or fought against the enemies of the Koran In this personal quarrel the troops of Irak Syria and Egypt were recruited from the tribes ot Arabia and the Turkish hordes his cavalry might be numerous though we should deduct some myriads from the hundred and thirty thousand horses of the royal stables and the expense of the armament was computed at four millions sterling or one hundred thousand pounds of gold From Tarsus the place of assembly the Saracens advanced in three divisions along the high road of Constantinople Motassem himself command ed the centre and the vanguard was given to his son Abbas who in the trial of the first adventures might succeed with the more glory or fail with the least re proach In the revenge of his injury the caliph prepared to retaliate a similar affront The father of Theophilus was a native of Amorium 3 in Phrygia the original seat of the imperial house had been adorned with privileges and monu ments and whatever might be the indifference of the people Constantinople it self was scarcely of more value in the eyes of the sovereign and his court The name of Armorium was inscribed on the shields of the Saracens and their three armies were again united under the walls of the devoted citj It had been pro posed by the wisest counsellors to evacuate Amorium to remove the inhabitants and to abandon the empty structures to the vain resentment of the barbarians The emperor embraced the more generous i esolution of defending in a siege and battle the country of his ancestors When the armies drew near the front of the

the evening rain very few of the Christians could have escaped with the emperor from the field of battle They breathed at Dorylieum at the distance of three days and Theophilus reviewing his trembling squadrons forgave the common flight both of the prince and people After this discovery of his weakness he vainly hoped to deprecate the fame of Amorium the inexorable caliph rejected with contempt his prayers and promises and detained the Roman ambassadors to be the witnesses x f his great revenge They had nearly been the witnesses of his shame The vi gorous assaults of fifty five days were encountered by a faithful governor a veteran garrison and a desperate people and the Saracens must have raised the siege if a domestic traitor had not pointed to the weakest part of the wall a place which â was decorated with the statues of a lion and a bull The vow of Motassem was accomplished with unrelenting rigour tired rather than satiated with de struction he returned to his new palace of Samara in the neighbourhood of Bag dad while the unfortunate Theophilus implored the tardy and doubtful aid of his western rival the emperor of the Franks Yet in the seige of Amorium above â seventy thousand Moslems had perished their loss had been revenged by the  slaughter of thirty thousand Christians and the sufferings of an equal number of captives who were treated as the most atrocious criminals Mutual necessity could sometimes extort the exchange or ransom of prisoners 2 but in the national and religious conflict of the two empires peace was without confidence and war with out mercy Quarter was seldom given in the field those who escaped the edge of the sword were condemned to hopeless servitude or exquisite torture and a catholic emperor relates with visible satisfaction

tyrant odious to his subjects he cast himself on the fidelity of the strangers and these strangers ambitious and apprehensive were tempted by the rich promise of a re volution At the instigation or at least in the cause of his son they burst into his apartment at the hour of supper and the caliph was cut into seven pieces by the same swords which he had recently distributed among the guards of his life and throne To this throne yet streaming with a father s blood Montasser was tri umphantly led but in a reign of six months he found only the pangs of a guilty conscience If he wept at the sight of an old tapestry which represented the crime and punishment of the sons of Chosroes if his days were abridged by grief and remorse we may allow some pity to a parricide who exclaimed in the bitterness of death that he had lost both this world and the world to come After this act of treason the ensigns of royalty the garment and walking staff of Mahomet were given and torn away by the foreign mercenaries who in four years created deposed and murdered three commanders of the faithful As often as the Turks were inflamed by fear or rage or avarice these caliphs were dragged by the feet exposed naked to the scorching sun beaten with iron clubs and compelled to pur chase by the abdication of their dignity a short reprieve of inevitable fate 2 At length however the fury of the tempest was spent or diverted the Abbassides returned to the less turbulent residence of Bagdad the insolence of the Turks was curbed with a firmer and more skilful hand and their numbers were divided and destroyed in foreign warfare But the nations of the east had been taught to trample on the successors of the prophet and the blessings of domestic peace were obtained by the relaxation of strength and discipline So uniform are the mischiefs of military despotism that I seem to repeat the story of theprxtorians of Home 3 While the flame of enthusiasm was damped by the business the pleasure and

the book of prophecy had been sealed by the apostle of Mecca the wishes and if we may profane the word even the reason of fanaticism might believe that after the successive missions of Adam Noah Abraham Moses Jesus and Mahomet the same God in the fulness of time would reveal a still more perfect and permanent law In the two hundred and seventy seventh year of the Hegira and in the

disciples by the daily repetition of fifty prayers The idleness and ferment of the rustic crowd awakened the attention of the magistrates of Cufa a timid persecution assisted the progress of the new sect and the name of the prophet became more revered after his person had been withdrawn from the world His twelve apostles dispersed themselves among the Bedoweens a race of men says Abulfeda  equally devoid of reason and religion and the success of their preaching seemed to threaten Arabia with a new revolution The Carmathians were ripe for rebellion since they disclaimed the title of the

rather to the sword of Abu Said and his son Abu Taher and these rebellious imams could muster in the field a hundred and seven thousand fanatics The mercenaries of the caliph were dismayed at the approach of an enemy who neither asked nor accepted quarter and the difference between them in fortitude and patience is expressive of the change which three centuries of prosperity had effected In the character of the Arabians Such troops were discomfited in every action the cities of Racca and Baalbec of Cufa and Bassora were taken and pillaged Bagdad was filled with consternation and the caliph trembled behind the veils of his palace In a daring inroad beyond the Tigris Abu Taher advanced to the gates of the capital with no more than five hundred horse By the special order of Moctader the bridges had been broken down and the person or head of the rebel was expected every hour by the com mander of the faithful His lieutenant from a motive of fear or pity apprized Abu Taher of his danger and recommended a speedy escape  Your master Â aid the intrepid Carmathian to the messenger  is at the head of thirty thousand soldiers three such men as these are wanting in his host at the

They obeyed without a murmur  Relate con tinued the imam  what you have seen before the evening your general shall be chained among my dogs Before the evening the camp was surprised and the menace was executed The rapine of the Carmathians was sanctified by their aversion to the worship of Mecca they robbed a caravan of pilgrims and twenty thousand devout Moslems were abandoned on the burning sands to a death of hunger and thirst Another year they suffered the pilgrims to proceed without interruption but in the festival of devotion Abu Taher stormed the holy city and trampled on the most venerable relics of the Mahometan faith Thirty thou sand citizens and strangers were put to the sword the sacred precincts were pol luted by the burial of three thousand dead bodies the well of Zemzem overflowed with blood the golden spout was forced from its place the veil of the Caaba was divided among these impious sectaries and the black stone the first monument of the nation was borne away in triumph to their capital After this deed of sa crilege and cruelty they continued to infest the confines of Irak Syria and Egypt but the vital principle of enthusiasm had withered at the root Their scruples or their avarice again opened the pilgrimage of Mecca and restored the black stone of the Caaba and it is needless to inquire into what factions they were broken or by whose swords they were finally extirpated The sect of the Carmathians may be considered as the second visible cause of the decline and fall of the empire of the caliphs l The third and most obvious cause was the weight and magnitude of the empire itself The caliph Almamon might proudly assert that it was easier for him to rule the east and the west than to manage a chess board of two feet square 2 yet I suspect that in both those games he was guilty ofrnany fatal mistakes and I perceive that in the distant provinces the authority of the first and most power ful of the Abbassides was already impaired The analogy of despotism invests the representative with the full majesty of the prince the division and balance of powers might relax the habits of obedience might encourage the passive subje et to inquire into the origin and administration of civil government He who is born in the purple is seldom worthy to reign but the elevation of a private man of a peasant perhaps or a slave affords a strong presumption of his courage and capa city I he viceroy of a remote kingdom aspires to secure the property and inhe ritance of his precarious trust the nations must rejoice in the presence of their sovereign and the command of armies and treasures are at once the object and the instrument of his ambition A change was scarcely visible as long as the lieute nants of the caliph were content with their vicarious

I can return with out reluctance to the homely fare of my youth From the height where he stood the descent would not have been so soft or harmless a timely death secured his own repose and that of the caliph who paid with the most lavish concessions the retreat of his brother Amrou to the palaces of Shiraz and Ispahan The Abbas sides were too feeble to contend too proud to forgive they invited the powerful dynasty of the Samanidcs who passed the Oxus with ten thousand horse so poor that their stirrups were of wood so brave that they vanquished the Soffarian army eight times more numerous than their own The captive Amrou was sent in chains a grateful offering to the court of Bagdad and as the victor was content â with the inheritance of Transoxiana and Chorasan the realms of Persia returned

the important cities of Mosul and Aleppo was occupied by the Arabian princes of the tribe of Hamadan The poets of their court could repeat â without a blush that nature had formed their countenances for beauty their tongues for eloquence and their hands for liberality and valour but the genuine tale of the elevation and reign of the Hamadanites exhibits a scene of treachery murder and parricide At the same fatal period the Persian kingdom was again usurped by the dynasty of the Bowides by the sword of three brothers who un der various names were styled the support and columns of the state and who from the Caspian sea to the ocean would suffer no tyrants but themselves Under their reign the language and genius of Persia revived and the Arabs three hundred and four years after the death of Mahomet were deprived of the sceptre of the east Radhi the twentieth of the Abbassides and the thirty ninth of the successors of Mahomet was the last who deserved the title of commander of the faithful t the last says Abulfeda who spoke to the people or conversed with the learned the last who in the expense of his household represented the wealth and magni ficence of the ancient caliphs After him the lords of the eastern world were re duced to the most abject misery and exposed to the blows and insults of a servile condition The revolt of the provinces circumscribed their dominions within the walls of Bagdad but that capital still contained an innumerable multitude vain of their past fortune discontented with their present state and oppressed by the de mands of a treasury which had formerly been replenished by the spoil and tri bute of nations Their idleness was exercised by faction and controversy Under the mask of piety the rigid followers of Hanbal 2 invaded the pleasures of do mestic life burst into the houses of plebeians and princes spilled the wine broke the instruments beat the musicians and dishonoured with infamous suspicions the associates of every handsome youth In each profession which allowed room for two persons the one was a votary the other an antagonist of Ali and the Ab bassides were awakened by the clamorous grief of the sectaries who denied their title and cursed their progenitors A turbulent people could only be repressed by a military force but who could satisfy the avarice or assert the discipline of the mercenaries themselves  The African and the Turkish guards drew their swords against each other and the chief commanders the emirs al Omra 3 im prisoned or deposed their sovereigns and violated the sanctuary of the mosch and

sterling was assigned by his generosity for the private expense of the commander of the faithful But on the fortieth day at the audience of the ambassadors of Chorasan and in the presence of a trembling multitude the caliph was dragged from his throne to a dungeon by the command of the stranger and the rude hands of his Dilemites His palace was pillaged his eyes were put out and the mean

the hostile transactions of the two nations were confined to some inroads by sea and land the fruits of their close vicinity and in delible hatred But when the eastern world was convulsed and broken the Greeks were roused from their lethargy by the hopes of conquest and revenge The Byzantine empire since the accession of the Basilian race had reposed in peace and dignity and they might encounter with their entire strength the front of some petty emir whose rear was assaulted and threatened by his national foes of the Mahometan faith The lofty titles of the morning star and the death of the Saracens l were applied in the public acclamations to Nicephorus Phocas a prince as renowned in the camp as he was unpopular in the city In the subordi nate station of great domestic or general of the east he reduced the island of Crete and extirpated the nest of pirates who had so long defied with impunity the majesty of the empire 2 His military genius was displayed in the conduct and success of the enterprise which had so often failed with loss and dishonour The Saracens were confounded with the landing of his troops on safe and level bridges which he cast from the vessels to the shore Seven months were con sumed in the siege of Candia the despair of the native Cretans was stimulated by the frequent aid of their brethren of Africa and Spain and after the massy wall and double ditch had been stormed by the Greeks a hopeless conflict was still maintained in the streets and houses of the city The whole island was subdued in the capital and a submissive people accepted without resistance the baptism of the conqueror 3 Constantinople applauded the long forgotten pomp of a tri umph but the imperial diadem was the sole reward that could repay the services or satisfy the ambition of Nicephorus After the death of the younger Romanus the fourth in lineal descent of the Ba silian race his widow Theophania successively married Nicephorus Phocas and his assassin John
