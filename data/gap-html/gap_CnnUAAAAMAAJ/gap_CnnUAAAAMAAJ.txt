CONTAINING THE INTERVAL OF ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY SEVEN YEARS FROM THE DEATH OF AHAB TO THE CAPTIVITY OF THE TEN TRIBES CHAP I Concerning Jehoshaphat again homo he constituted judges and by God s assistance overcame his enemies Â 1 WHEN Jehoshaphat the king was come to Jerusa lem from the assistance he had afforded Ahab the king of Israel when he fought with Benhadad king of Syria the pro phet Jehu met him and accused him for assisting Ahab a man both impious and wicked and said to him That  God was displeased with him for so doing but that he delivered him from the enemy notwithstanding he had sinned because of his own proper disposition which was good Whereupon the king betook himself to thanksgivings and sacrifices to God after which he presently went over all that country which he ruled round about and taught the people as well the laws which God gave them by Moses as that religious worship that was due to him He also constituted judges in every one of the cities of his kingdom and charged them  to have regard to nothing so much in judging the multitude as to do justice and not to be moved by bribes nor by the dignity of men eminent for either their riches or their high birth but to distribute justice equally to all as knowing that God is con scious of every secret action of theirs When he had him self instructed them thus and gone over every city of the two tribes he returned to Jerusalem He there also constituted VOL II A 15 4 ANTIQUITIES OK THE JEWS Book IX  judges out of the priests and the Levites and principal persons of the multitude and admonished them to pass all their sentences with care and justice And that if any of the people of his coun try had differences of great consequence they should send them out of the other cities to these judges who would be obliged to give righteous sentences concerning such causes and this with the greater care because it is proper that the sentences which are given in that city wherein the temple of God is and where in the king dwells be given with great care and the utmost justice Now he set over them Amariah the priest and Zeba diah both of the tribe of Judah and after this manner it was that the king ordered these affairs 2 About the same time the Moabites and Ammonites made an expedition against Jehoshaphat and took with them a great body of Arabians and pitched their camp at Engedi a city that is situate at the lake Asphaltitis and distant three hundred furlongs from Jerusalem In that place grows the best kind of palm trees and the  opobalsamum Now Jehoshaphat heard that the enemies had passed over the lake and had made an irruption into that country which belonged to his kingdom at which news he was affrighted and called the people of Jerusalem to a congregation in the temple and standing over against the temple itseltj he called upon God To afford him power and strength so as to inflict punishment on those that made this expedition against them for that those who built this his tem pie had prayed that he would protect that city and take ven geance on those that were so bold as to come against it for they are come to take from us that land which thou hast given us for a possession When he had prayed thus he fell into tears and the whole multitude together with their wives and children made their supplications also  Upon which a cer Jain prophet Jahaziel by name came into the midst of the assem bly and cried out and spake both to the multitude and to the king that God heard their prayers and promised to fight against their enemies He also gave order that the king should draw his forces out the next day for that he should find them between Jerusalem and the ascent of Engedi at a place called the Emi nence and that he should not fight against them but only stand still and see how God would fight against them When the pro phet had said this both the king and the multitude fell upon their  These judges constituted by Jehoshaphat were a kind of Jerusalem

God with their instruments of music 3 As soon as it was day and the king was come mto that wilderness which is under the city of Tekoa he said to the mul titude That  they ought to give credit to what the prophet had said and not to set themselves in array for fighting but to set the priests with their trumpets and the Levites with the sing ers of hymns to give thanks to God as having already deliver ed our country from our enemies This opinion of the king pleased the people and they did what he advised them to do So God caused a terror and a commotion to arise among the Am monites who thought one another to be enemies and slew one another insomuch that not one man out of so great an army escaped and when Jehoshaphat looked upon that valley wherein their enemies had been encamped and saw it full of dead men he rejoiced at so surprising an event as was this assistance of God while he himself by his own power and without their labour had given them the victory He also gave his army leave to take the prey of the enemies camp and to spoil their dead bodies and indeed so they did for three days together till they were weary so great was the number of the slain and on the fourth day all the people were gathered together unto a certain nollow place or valley and blessed God for his power and assist ance from which the place had this name given it the valley of _Berachah 01 blessing 4 And when the king had brought his army back to Jerusa lem he betook himself to celebrate festivals and offer sacrifices and this for many days And indeed after this destruction of their enemies and when it came to the ears of the foreign na tions they were all greatly affrighted as supposing that God would openly fight for him hereafter So Jehoshaphat from that time lived in great glory and splendour on account of his right eousness and his piety towards God He was also in friendship with Ahab s son who was king of Israel and he joined with him in the building of ships that were to sail to  Pontus and the  What are here Pontus and Thrace as the places whither Jehoshaphat s fleet sailed are in our other copies Opkir and Tttrshish and the place whence it sailed is in them Eziongeber which lay on the Red Sea whence it was impossible for any ships to sail to Pontus or Thrace so that Josephus copy differed from cur other copies as is farther plain from his own words which render what we read that the ships were broken at Eriongeber from their unwieldy greutnes But so far we may conclude that Josephus thought one Ophir to be somewhere in the Medi terranean and not in the South Sea though perhaps there might be another Ophir in that South Sea also and that fleets might then sail both from Phoenicia and from tii Red SeÂ to fetch the gold of Of iir 6 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book IX traffic cities of Thrace but he failed of his gains for the ships were destroyed by being so great and unwieldy on which account he was no longer concerned about shipping And this is the history of Jehoshaphat the king of Jerusalem CHAP II Concerning Ahaziah the king of Israel and again concerning the prophet Elijah Â 1 AND now Ahaziah the son of Ahab reigned over Is rael and made his abode in Samaria He was a wicked man and in all respects like to both his parents and to Jeroboam who first of all transgressed and began to deceive the people On the second year of his reign the king of Moab fell off from his obedience and left off paying those tributes which he be fore paid to his father Ahab Now it happened that Ahaziah as he was coming down from the top of his house fell down from it and in his sickness sent to the  Fly which was the god of Ekron for that was this god s name to inquire about his recovery But the God of the Hebrews appeared to Elijah the prophet and commanded him to go and meet the messengers that were sent and to ask them Whether the people of Israel had not a God of their own that the king sent to a foreign god to inquire about his recovery and to bid them return and tell the king that he would not escape this disease And when Elijah had performed what God had commanded him and the messengers had heard what he said they returned to the king immediately and when the king wondered how they could return so soon and asked them the reason of it they said that a certain man met them and forbade them to go on any farther but to return and tell thee from the command of the God of Israel that this disease will have a bad end And when the king bid them describe the man that said this to them they re plied that he was a hairy man and was girt about with a girdle of leather So the king understood by this that the man who was described by the messengers was Elijah whereupon he sent a captain to him with fifty soldiers and commanded them to bring Elijah to him and when the captain that was sent found Elijah sitting upon the top of a hill he commanded him to come down and to come to the king for so had he enjoined but that in case he refused they would carry him by force Elijah said to him  That you may have a trial whether I be a true pro  This god of Jlies seems to have been so called as was the like god among the Greeks from his supposed power over Hies in driving them away from the fiebh of their sacrifices which otherwise would have beer very troublesome to them Chap II ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 7 phet I will pray that  fire may fall from heaven and destroy both the soldiers and yourself So he prayed and a whirl wind of fire fell from heaven and destroyed the captain and those that were with him And when the king was informed of the destruction of these men he was very angry and sent an other captain with the like number of armed men that were sent before And when this captain also threatened the prophet that unless he came down of his own accord he would take him and carry him away upon his prayer against him the fire from heaven slew this captain as well as the other And when upon inquiry the king was informed of what happened to him he sent out a third captain But when this captain who was a wise man and of a mild disposition came to the place where Eli jah happened to be and spake civilly to him and said That he knew that it was without his own consent and only in submis sion to the king s command that he came unto him and that those that came before did not come willingly but on the same account He therefore desired him to have pity on those armed men that were with him and that he would come down and follow him to the king So Elijah accepted of his discreet words and courteous behaviour and came down and followed him And when he came to the king he prophesied to him and told him that  God said Since thou hast despised him as not being God and so unable to fortell the truth about thy distem per but has sent to the god of Ekron to inquire of him what will be the end of this thy distemper know this that thou shalt die 2 Accordingly the king in a very little time died as Elijah had foretold but Jehoram his brother succeeded him in the kingdom for he died without children but for this Jehoram he  It is commonly esteemed a very cruel action of Elijah s when ho called for Â fire from heaven and consumed no fewer than two cnptains and a hundred soldiers and this for no other crime than obeying the orders of their king in attempting to seize him and it is owned by our Saviour that it was an instance of greater severity than the spirit of the New Testament allows Luke ix 54 But then we must consider that it is not unlikely that these captains and soldiers believed that they were eent to fetch the prophet that he aright be put to death for foretelling the death of the king and this while they knew him to be the prophet of the true God the supreme King of Israel for they were still under the theocracy which was no less than impiety rebellion Aid treason in the highest degree Nor would the command of a subaltern or inferior captain contradicting the commands of the general when the captain and the soldiers both knew it to be so as I suppose justify or excuse such gross rebellion and disobedience in soldiers at this day Ac cordingly when Saul commanded his guards to slay Ahimclech and the priests at Nob they knew it to be an unlawful command and would not obey it 1 Sam xxii 17 From which cases both officers and soldiers may learn that the commands of their leaders or kings cannot justify or excuse them in doing what is wicked iÂ the sight of God or in fighting in an unjust cause when they know it so to he 8 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book IX was like his father Ahab in wickedness and reigned twelve years indulging himself in all sorts of wickedness and impiety towards God for leaving off his worship he worshipped foreign gods but in other respects he was an active man Now at this time it was that Elijah disappeared from among men and no one knows of his death to this very day but he left behind him his disciple Elisha as we have formeriy declared And indeed as to Elijah and as to Enoch who was before the deluge it is written in the sacred books that they disappeared but so that nobody knew that they died CHAP III How Joram and Jehoshaphat made an expedition against the Moabites As also concerning the wonders of Elisha and the death of Jehoshaphat Â 1 W HEN Joram had taken upon him the kingdom he determined to make an expedition against the king of Moab whose name was Mesha  for as we told you before he was departed from his obedience to his brother Ahaziah while he paid to his father Ahab two hundred thousand sheep with their fleeces of wool When therefore he had gathered his own army together he sent also to Jehoshaphat and entreated him that since he had from the beginning been a friend to his father he would assist him in the war that he was entering into against the Moabites who had departed from their obedience who not only himself promised to assist him but would also oblige the king of Edom who was under his authority to make the same expedition also When Joram had received these assurances of assistance from Jehoshaphat he took his army with him and came to Jerusalem and when he had been sumptuously entertained by the king of Jerusalem it was resolved upon by them to take their march against their enemies through the wilderness of Edom And when they had taken a compass of seven days journey they were in distress for want of water for the cattle and for the army from the mistake of their roads by the guides that conducted them insomuch that they were all in an agony especially Joram and cried to God by reason of their sorrow and desired to know what wickedness had been committed by them that induced him to deliver three kings together with out fighting unto the king of Moab But Jehoshaphat who was a righteous man encouraged him and bid him send to the camp and know whether any prophet of God was come along with them that we might by him learn from God what we should do And when one of the servants of Joram said that he had seen there Elisha the son of Shaphat the disciple of Chap III ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 9 Elijah the three kings went to him at the entreaty of Jehosha phat and when they were come at the prophet s tent which tent was pitched out of the camp they asked him What would become of the army and Joram was particularly very pressing with him about it And when he replied to him That  he should not trouble him but go to his father s and mother s prophets for they to be sure were true prophets he still desired him to prophesy and to save them So he swore by God that he would not answer him unless it were on ac count of Jehoshaphat who was an holy and righteous man and when at his desire they brought him a man that could play on  the psaltery the Divine Spirit came upon him as the music played and he commanded them to dig many trenches in the val ley for said he Though there appear neither cloud nor wind nor storm of rain ye shall see this valley full of water till the army and the cattle be saved for you by drinking of it Nor will this be all the favour that you shall receive from God but you shall also overcome your enemies and take the best and strongest cities of the Moabites and you shall  cut down their fruit trees and lay waste their coun try and stop up their fountains and rivers 2 When the prophet had said this the next day before the sun rising a great torrent ran strongly for God had caused it to rain very plentifully at the distance of three days journey mto Edom so that the army and the cattle found water to drink in abundance But when the Moabites heard that the three kings were coming upon them and made their approach through the wilderness the king of Moab gathered his army together presently and commanded them to pitch their camp upon the mountains that when the enemies should attempt to enter their country they might not be concealed from them But when at the rising of the sun they saw the water in the torrent for it was not far from the land of Moab and that it was of the colour of blood for at such a time the water especially looks red by the shining of the sun upon it they formed a false notion of the state of their enemies as if they had slain one ano ther for thirst and that the river ran with their blood How ever supposing that this was the case they desired their king would send them out to spoil their enemies whereupon they  This practice of cutting down or plucking up by the roots the fruit trees was forbidden even in ordinary wars by the law of Moses cut xx 19 20 and only allowed by God in this particular case when the Moabites were to be punished and cut oh in an extraordinary manner for their wickedness See Jer xlviii 11 1 13 and many the like prophecies against them Nothing could therefore justify this practice but a particular commission from God by his pro phet as in the present case which was ever a sufficient warrant for breaking any tucb ritual or ceremonial law whatsoever 10 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEW S Book IX ail went in haste as to an advantage already gained and came to the enemies camp as supposing them destroyed already But their hope deceived them for as their enemies stood round about them some of them were cut to pieces and others of them were dispersed and fled to their own country And when the kings fell into the land of Moab they overthrew the cities that were in it and spoiled their fields and marred them filling them with stones out of the brooks and cut down the best of their trees and stopped up their fountains of water and overthrew their walls to their foundations But the king of Moab when he was pursued endured a siege and seeing his city in danger of being overthrown by force made a sally and went out with seven hundred men in order to break through the enemies camp with his horsemen on that side where the watch seemed to be kept most negligently  and when upon trial he could not get away for he light upon a place that was care fully watched he returned into the city and did a thing that showed despair and the utmost distress for he took his eldest son who was to reign after him and lifting him up upon the wall that he might be visible to all the enemies he offered him as a whole burnt offering to God whom when the kings saw they commiserated the distress that was the occasion of it and were so affected in way of humanity and pity that they raised the siege and every one returned to his own house So Jeho shaphat came to Jerusalem and continued in peace there and out lived this expedition but a little time and then died having lived in all sixty years and of them reigned twenty five He was buried in a magnificent manner in Jerusalem for he had imitated the actions of David CHAP IV Jehoram succeeds Jehoshaphat how Joram his namesake king of Israel fought with the Syrians  and what wonders were done by the prophet Elisha Â 1 JEHOSHAPHAT had a good number of children but he appointed his eldest son Jehoram to be his successor who had the same name with his mother s brother that was king of Israel and the son of Ahab Now when the king of Israel was come out of the land of Moab to Samaria he had with him Elisha the prophet whose acts I have a mind to go over particularly for they were illustrious and worthy to be related as we have set them down in the sacred books 2 For they say that the  widow of Obadiah Ahab s steward  That this woman who cried to Elisha and who in our Bible is styled the wrfc of one of the sans of the jtrojihets 2 Kings iv 1 was no other than the Chap IV ANTlgUITiEE OF THE JEWS 11 came to him and said That  he was not ignorant how her husband had preserved the prophets that were to be slain by Jezebel the wife of Ahab for she said that he hid a hundred of them and had borrowed money for their maintenance Â that after her husband s death she and her children were car ried away to be made slaves by the creditors and she desired of him to have mercy upon her on account of what her hus band did and afford her some assistance And when he ask ed her what she had in the house she said Nothing but a very small quantity of oil in a cruse  So the prophet bid her go away and borrow a great many empty vessels of her neighbours and when she had shut her chamber door to pour the oil into them all for God would fill them full And when the woman had done what she was commanded to do and bade her children bring every one of the vessels and all were filled and not one left empty she came to the prophet and told him that they were all full Upon which he advised her to go away and sell the oil and pay the creditors what was owing to them for that there would be some surplus of the price of the oil which she might make use of for the maintenance of her children And thus did Elisha discharge the woman s debts and free her from the vexa tion of her creditors 3  Elisha also sent an hasty message to Joram and exhorted him to take care of that place for that therein were some Sy widow of Obadiah the good steward of Aliah is confirmed by the Chaldee paraphrast and by the Rabbins and others Nor is that unlikely which Jose plms here adds that these debts were contracted by her husband for the sup port of those hundred of the Lord s jrrophets whom he maintained by Jifty in a cave in the days of Ahab and Jezebel 1 Kings xviii 4 which circumstance rendered it highly fit that the prophet Elisha should provide her a remedy and enable her to redeem herself and her sons from the fear of that slavery which insolvent debtors were liable to by the law of Moses Lev xxv 59 Matt xviii 25 which he did accordingly with God s help at the expense of a miracle  Dr Hudson with very good reason suspects that there is no small defect in our present copies of Josephus just before the beginning of this section and that chiefly as to that distinct account which he had given us reason to expect in the first section and to which he seems to refer chap viii Â 6 concerning the glo rious miracles which Elisha wrought which indeed in our Bibles are not i few 2 Kings ivâ ix but of which we have several omitted in Josephus present co pies One of these histories omitted at present was evidently in his Bible I mean that of the curing of Naaman s leprosy 2 Kings v for he plainly alludes to it B III chap xi Â 4 here he observes That there were lepers in many nations who yet have been in honour and not only free from reproach and avoidance but who have been great captains of armies and been intrusted with high offices in the commonwealth and have had the privilege of entering into holy places and ti mples But what makes me most regret the want of that history in our present copies of Josephus is this that we have here as it is com monly understood one of the greatest difficulties in all the Bible that in 2 Kingt v 18  9 where Naaman after he had been miraculously cured by a prophet of the true God and had thereupon promised ver 17 that he would hence VOL II B 15 12 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book IX rians lying in ambush to kill him So the king did as the pro phet exhorted him and avoided his going a hunting And when Benhadad missed of the success of his lying in ambush he was wroth with his own servants as if they had betrayed his am bushment to Joram and sent for them and said they were the betrayers of his secret counsels and he threatened that he would put them to death since such their practice was evident because he had intrusted this secret to none but them and yet it was made known to his enemy And when one that was pre sent said that  he should not mistake himself nor suspect that they h ad discovered to his enemy his sending men to kill him but that he ought to know that it was Elisha the prophet who discovered all to him and laid open all his counsels he gave order that they should send some to learn in what city Eli sha dwelt Accordingly those thatwere sent brought word that he was in Dothan wherefore Benhadad sent to that city a great army with horses and chariots to take Elisha so they encom passed the city round about by night and kept him therein con fined but when the prophet s servant in the morning perceived this and that his enemies sought to take Elisha he came running and crying out after a disordered manner to him and told him of it but he encouraged him and bid him not be afraid and to despise the enemy and trust in the assistance of God and was himself without fear and he besought God to make manifest to his servant his power and presence so far as was possible in order to the inspiring him with hope and courage According ly God heard the prayer of the prophet and made the servant see a multitude of chariots and horses encompassing Elisha till he laid aside his fear and his courage revived at the sight of what he supposed was come to their assistance After this Eli sha did farther entreat God that he would dim the eyes of their enemies and cast a mist before them whereby they might not discern him When this was done he went into the midst of his enemies and asked them who it was that they came to seek and when they replied the prophet Elisha he promised he would deliver him to them if they would follow him to the city where he was So these men were so darkened by God in their sight and in their mind that they followed him very diligently and when Elisha had brought them to Samaria he ordered Joram the king to shut the gates and to place his own army round forth offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice unto other gods but unto the Lord ndds In this thing the Lord pardon thy servant that when my master goeth into the house of Rimmon to worship there and he leaneth on my hands and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon when I how down myself in the house of Rimmon the Lord pardon thy servant in this thing And Elisha said Go in peace This looks like a prophet s permission for being partaker in idolatry itself out of compliance with an idolatrous court Chap IV ANTIQUITIES QT THE JEWS 13 about them and prayed to God to clear the eyes of these their enemies and take the mist from before them Accordingly when they were freed from the obscurity they had been in they saw themselves in the midst of their enemies and as the Syrians were strangely amazed and distressed as was but reasonable at an action so divine and surprising and as king Joram asked the prophet if he would give him leave to shoot at them Elisha forbade him so to do and said that it is just to kill those that are taken in battle but that these men had done the country no harm but without knowing it were come thither by the divine power So that his counsel was to treat them in a hospitable manner at his table and then send them away with out hurting them Wherefore Joram obeyed the prophet and when he had feasted the Syrians in a splendid and magnifi cent manner he let them go to Benhadad their king 4 Now when these men were come back and had showed Ben fiaclad how strange an accident had befallen them and what an appearance and power they had experienced of the God of Israel he wondered at it as also at that prophet with whom God was so evidently present so he determined to make no more secret attempts upon the king of Israel out of fear of Elisha but re solved to make open war with them as supposing he could be too hard for his enemies by the multitude of his army and power So he made an expedition with a great army against Joram who not thinking himself a match for him shut himself up in Sama ria and depended on the strength of its walls but Benhadad supposed he should take the city if not by his engines of war yet that he should overcome the Samaritans by famine and the want of necessaries and brought his army upon them and besieged the city and the plenty of necessaries was brought so low with Jo ram and from the extremity of want an ass s head was sold in Samaria for fourscore pieces of silver and the Hebrews bought a sextary of dove s dung instead of salt for five pieces of silver Now Joram was in fear lest somebody should betray the city to the enemy by reason of the famine and went every day round the walls and the guards to see whether any such were concealed among them and by being thus seen and taking such care he deprived them of the opportunity of contriving any such thing and if they had a mind to do it he by this means prevented them but upon a certain woman s crying out Have pity on  Upon occasion of this stratagem of ElUha s in Josephus we may take no tice that although Josephus was one of the greatest lovers of truth in the world yet in a just war he seems to have had no manner of scruple upon him l y ail such stratagems possible to deceive public enemies See also

thought that she was about to ask for somewhat to eat he imprecated God s curse upon her and said he had neither threshing floor nor wine press whence he might give her any thing at her petition Upon which she said  She did not desire his aid in any such thing nor trouble him about food but desired that he would do her justice as to another woman And when he bade her say on and let him know what she desired she said She had made an agreement with the other woman who was her neighbour and her friend that because the famine and want was intolerable they should kill their children each of them having a son of their own and we will live upon them ourselves for two days the one day upon one son and the other day upon the other and said she I have killed my son the first day and we lived upon my son yesterday but this other woman will not do the same thing but hath broken her agreement and hath hid her son This story mightily grieved Joram when he heard it so he rent his garment and cried out with a loud voice and conceived great wrath against Elisha the prophet and set himself eagerly to have him slain because he did not pray to God to provide them some exit and way of escape out of the miseries with which they were surrounded and sent one away immediately to cut off his head who made haste to kill the prophet but Elisha was not un acquainted with the wrath of the king against him for as he sat in his house by himself with none but his disciples about him he told them that Joram  who was the son of a murderer had sent one to take away his head but said he when he that is commanded to do this comes take care that ye do not let him come in but press the door against him and hold him fast there for the king himself will follow him and come to me having altered his mind Accordingly they did as they were bidden when he that was sent by the king to kill Elisha came but Joram repented of his wrath against the prophet and for fear he that was commanded to kill him should have done it before he came he made haste to hinder his slaughter and to save the prophet and when he came to him he accused him that he did not pray to God for their deliverance from the miseries they lay now under but saw them so sadly de stroyed by them Hereupon Elisha promised that the very next  This son of a murderer was Joram the son of Ahab which Ahab slew or permitted his wife Jezebel to slay the Lord s prophets and Naboth I Kings xviii 4 xxi 19 and he is here called by this name I suppose because he had now also himself sent an officer to murder him yet is Josephus account of Joram s coming himself at tast as repenting of his intended cruelty much more probable than that in our copies 2 Kings vi 33 which rather implies the contrary Chap IV ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 15 day at the very same hour in which the king came to him they should have great plenty of food and that two seah of barley should be sold in the market for a shekel and a seah of fine flour should be sold for a shekel This prediction made Jo ram and those that were present very joyful for they did not scruple believing what the prophet said on account of the expe rience they had of the truth of his former predictions  and the expectation of plenty made the want they were in that day with the uneasiness that accompanied it appear a light thing to them but the captain of the third band who was a friend of the king s and on whose hand the king leaned said Thou talkest of in credible things O prophet for as it is impossible for God to pour down torrents of barley or fine flour out of heaven so is it impossible that what thou sayest should come to pass To which the prophet made this reply Thou shalt see these things come to pass but thou shalt not be in the least a par taker of them 5 Now what Elisha had thus foretold came to pass in the manner following There was a  law at Samaria that those that had the leprosy and whose bodies were not cleansed from it should abide without the city and there were four men that on this account abode before the gates while nobody gave them any food by reason of the extremity of the famine and as they were prohibited from entering into the city by the law and they considered that if they were permitted to enter they should mi serably perish by the famine as also that if they staid where they were they should suffer in the same manner they resolved to deliver themselves up to the enemy that in case they should spare them they should live but if they should be killed that would be an easy death So when they had confirmed this their resolution they came by night to the enemies camp Now God had begun to affright and disturb the Syrians and to bring the noise of chariots and armour to their ears as though an army were coming upon them and had made them suspect that it was coming nearer and nearer to them In short they were in such a dread of this army that they left their tents and ran together to Benhadad and said That Joram the king of Israel had hired for auxiliaries both the king of Egypt and the king of the islands and led them against them for they heard the noise of them as they were coming And Benhadad believed what they said for there came the same noise to his ears as well as it did to theirs so they fell into a mighty disorder and tumult and left their horses and beasts in their camp with immense  This law of the Jews for the exclusion of lepers out of the camp in the ilderness and out of the cities in Juik a is a well known one Lev xiii 46 and Sum v 1â 4 16 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book IX riches also and betook themselves to flight And those lepers who had departed from Samaria and were gone to the camp of the Syrians of whom we made mention a little before when they were in the camp saw nothing but great quietness and si lence  accordingly they entered into it and went hastily into one of their tents and when they saw nobody there they eat and drank and carried garments and a great quantity of gold and hid it out of the camp  after which they went into another tent and carried off what was in it as they did at the former and this did they for several times without the least interruption from any body So they gathered thereby that the enemies were departed whereupon they reproached themselves that they did not inform Joram and the citizens of it So they came to the walls of Samaria and called aloud to the watchmen and told them in what state the enemies were as did these tell the king s guards by whose means Joram came to know of it who then sent for his friends and the captains of his host and said to them That he suspected that this departure of the king of Sy ria was by way of ambush and treachery and that out of de spair of ruining you by famine when you imagine them to be fled away you may come out of the city to spoil their camp and he may then fall upon you on a sudden and may both kill you and take the city without fighting whence it is that I exhort you to guard the city carefully and by no  means to go out of it or proudly to despise your enemies as though they were really gone away And when a certain person said That he did very well and wisely to admit such a suspicion but that he still advised him to send a couple of horsemen to search all the country as far as Jordan that if they were seized by an ambush of the enemy they might be a security to your army that they may not go out as if they suspected nothing nor undergo the like misfortune and said he those horsemen may be numbered among those that have died by the famine supposing they be caught and destroyed by the enemy So the king was pleased with this opinion and sent such as might search out the truth who per formed their journey over a road that was without any enemies but found it full of provisions and of weapons that they had therefore thrown away and left behind them in order to their being light and expeditious in their flight When the king heard this he sent out the multitude to take the spoils of the camp which gains of theirs was not of things of small value but they took a great quantity of gold and a great quantity of silver and flocks of all kinds of cattle They also possessed themselves of so many ten thousand measures of wheat and barley as they never in the least dreamed of and were not only freed from Chap IV ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 17 their former miseries but had such plenty that two seahs of barley were bought for a shekel and a seah of fine fkur for a shekel according to the prophecy of Elisha Now a seah is equal to an Italian modius and a half The captain of the third band was the only man that received no benefit by this plenty for as he was appointed by the king to oversee the gate that he might prevent the too great a crowd of the multitude that they might not endanger one another and perish by treading on one another in the press he suffered himself in that very way and died in that very manner as Elisha had foretold such his death when he alone of them all disbelieved what he said concerning that plenty of provisions which they should soon have 6 Hereupon when Benhadad the king of Syria had escaped to Damascus and understood that it was God himself that cast all his army into this fear and disorder and that it did not arise from the invasion of enemies he was mightily cast down at his having God so greatly for his enemy and fell into a distemper Now it happened that Elisha the prophet at that time was gone out of his own country to Damascus of which Benhadad was informed he sent Hazael the most faithful of all his ser vants to meet him and to carry him presents and bade him in quire of him about his distemper and whether he should escape the danger that it threatened So Hazael came to Elisha with forty camels that carried the best and most precious fruits that the country of Damascus afforded as well as those which the king s palace supplied He saluted him kindly and said That he was sent to him by king Benhadad and brought presents with him in order to inquire concerning his distemper whe ther he should recover from it or not Whereupon the prophet bid him tell the king no melancholy news but still he said he would die So the king s servant was troubled to hear it and Elisha wept also and his tears ran down plenteously at his foresight of what miseries his people would undergo after the death of Benhadad And when Hazael asked what was the occasion of this confusion he was in he said That  he wept out of his commiseration for the multitude of the Israel ites and what terrible miseries they will suffer by thee for thou wilt slay the strongest of them and will burn their strongest cities and will destroy their children and dash them against the stones and will rip up their women with child And when Hazael said How can it be that I should have power enough to do such things the prophet replied That God had informed him that he should be king of Syria So when Ha ael was come to Benhadad he told him good news concerning his distemper  but on the next day he spread a Since Elijah did not live to anoint Hazaei king of Syria himself as h snpowored to do 1 Kings xix 15 it was most probably now done iu bis 18 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book IX wet cloth in the nature of a net over him and strangled him and took his dominion He was an active man and had the good will of the Syrians and of the people of Damascus to a great degree by whom both Benhadad himself and Hazael who ruled after him are honoured to this day as gods by rea son of their benefactions and their building them temples by which they adorned the city of the Damascenes They also every day do with great pomp pay their worship  to these kings and value themselves upon their antiquity nor do they know that these kings are much later than they imagine and that they are not yet eleven hundred years old Now when Joram the king of Israel heard that Benhadad was dead he recovered out of the terror and dread he had been in on his account and was very glad to live in peace CHAP V Concerning the wickedness of Jehoram king of Jerusalem His defeat and death Â 1 Now Jehoram the king of Jerusalem for we have said before that he had the same name with the king of Israel as soon as he had taken the government upon him betook himself to the slaughter of his brethren and his father s friends who were go vernors under him and thence made a beginning and a de monstration of his wickedness nor was he at all better than those kings of Israel who at first transgressed against the laws of their country and of the Hebrews and against God s worship And it was Athaliah the daughter of Ahab whom he had married who taught him to be a bad man in other re spects and also to worship foreign gods Now God would not quite root out this family because of the promise he had made by his servant and successor Elisha Nor does it seem to me otherwise but that Benhadad immediately recovered of his disease as the prophet foretold and that Hazael upon his being anointed to succeed him though he ought to have staid till he died by the course of nature or some other way of divine punish ment as did David for many years in the like case was too impatient and the very next day smothered or strangled him in order to come directly to the suc cession  What Mr Le Clerc pretends here that it i more probable that Hazael and his son were worshipped by the Syrians and people of Damascus till the days of Joseplms than Benhadad and Hazael because under Benhadad they had greatly suffered and because it is almost incredible that both a king and that king s murderer should be worshipped by the same Syrians is of little force against those records out of which Joscphus drew his history especially when it is likely that they thought Benhadad died of the distemper he laboured under and not by Hazacl s treachery Besides the reason that Josephus gives for this adoration and that these two kings had been great benefactors to the inhabitants of Damascus and had built them temples is too remote from the political suspicions of Le Clcrcj nor ought such weak suspicions to be deemed of any force against authentic testi monies of antiquity Chap V ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 19 to David However Jehoram did not leave off the introduc tion of new sorts of customs to the propagation of impiety and to the ruin of the customs of his own country And when the Edomites about that time had revolted from him and slain their former king who was in subjection to his father and had set up one of their own choosing Jehoram fell upon the land of Edom with the horsemen that were about him anil the cha riots by night and destroyed those that lay near to his own kingdom but did not proceed farther However this expedi tion did him no service for they all revolted from him with those that dwelt in the country of Libnah He was indeed so mad as to compel the people to go up to the high places of the mountains and worship foreign gods 2 And as he was doing this and had entirely cast his own coun try laws out of his mind there was brought him an  epistle from Elijah the prophet which declared that  God would ex ecute great judgments upon him because he had not imitated his own fathers but had followed the wicked courses of the kings of Israel and had compelled the tribe of Judah and the citizens of Jerusalem to leave the holy worship of their own God and to worship idols as Ahab had compelled the Israelites to do and because he had slain his brethren and the men that were good and righteous And the prophet gave him notice in this epistle what punishment he should under go for these crimes namely the destruction of his people  with the corruption of the king s own wives and children and that he should himself die of a dis temper in his bowels with long torments those his bowels falling out by the vio lence of the inward rottenness of the parts insomuch that though he see his own misery he shall not be able at all to help himself but shall die in that manner Thus it was which Elijah denounced to him in that epistle 3 It was not long after this that an army of those Arabians that lived near to Ethiopia and of the Philistines fell upon the kingdom of Jehoram and spoiled the country and the king s house Moreover they slew his sons and his wives one only of his sons was left him who escaped the enemy his name was Ahaziah  After which calamity he himself fell into that disease which was foretold by the prophet and lasted a great while for God inflicted this punishment upon him in his belly  This epistle in some copies of Josepbus is said to come to Joram from Elijah with this addition far he was yet upon earth which could not be true of Elijah who as all agree was gone from the earth about four years before and could only be true of Elisha nor perhaps is there any more mystery here than that the name of Elijah has very anciently crept into the text instead of Elisha by the copiers there being nothing in any copy of that epistle peculiar to Elijah VOL II C 15 20 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book IX out of his wrath against him and so he died miserably and saw his own bowels fall out The people also abused his dead body I suppose it was because they thought that such his death came upon him by the wrath of God and that therefore he was not worthy to partake of such a funeral as became kings Ac cordingly they neither buried him in the sepulchres of his fa thers nor vouchsafed him any honours but buried him like a private man and this when he had lived forty years and reigned eight And the people of Jerusalem delivered the government to his son Ahaziah CHAP VI How Jehu was anointed king and slew both Joram and Ahaziah  as also what he did for the punishment of the wicked  1 Now Joram the king of Israel after the death of Benhadad hoped that he might now take Ramoth a city of Gilead from the Syrians Accordingly he made an expedi tion against it with a great army but as he was besieging it an arrow was shot at him by one of the Syrians but the wound was not mortal So he returned to have his wound healed in Jezrcel but left his whole army in Ramoth and Jehu the son of Nimshi for their general for he had already taken the city by force and he proposed after he was healed to make war with the Syrians but Elisha the prophet sent one of hie disciples to Ramoth and gave him holy oil to anoint Jehu and to tell him that God had chosen him to be their king He also sent him to say other things to him and bid him to take his journey as if he fled that when he came away he might escape the knowledge of all men So when he was come to the city he found Jehu sitting in the midst of the captains of the army as Elisha had foretold he should find him So he came up to him and said that he desired to speak with him about certain matters and when he was arisen and had followed him into an inward chamber the young man took the oil and poured it on his head and said that  God or dained him to be king in order to his destroying the house of Ahab and that he might revenge the blood of the prophets that were unjustly slain by Jezebel that so their house might utterly perish as those of Jeroboam the son of Nebat and of Baasha had perished for their wickedness and no seed might remain of Ahab s family So when he had said this he went away hastily out of the chamber and endeavoured not to be seen by any of the army 2 But Jehu came out and went to the place where he before sat with the captains  and when they asked him and desired him to tell them wherefore it was that this young man came to him Chop VI ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 21 and added withal that he was mad he replied you guess right for the words he spake were the words of a madman and when they were e ger about the matter and desired he would tell them he answered that God had said he had chosen him to be king over the multitude When he had said this every one of them  put off his garment and strewed it under him and blew with trumpets and gave notice that Jehu was king So when he had gotten the army together he was preparing to set out im mediately against Joram at the city Jezreel in which city as we said before he was healing of the wound which he had received in the siege of Ramoth It happened also that Ahaziah king of Jerusalem was now come to Joram for he was his sister s son as we have said already to see how he did after his wound and this upon account of their kindred but as Jehu was desirous to fall upon Joram and those with him on the sudden he desired that none of the soldiers might run away and tell to Joram what had happened for that this would be an evident demonstration of their kindness to him and would show that their real inclinations were to make him king 3 So they were pleased with what he did and guarded the roads lest somebody should privately tell the thing to those that were at Jezreel Now Jehu took his choice horsemen and sat upon his chariot and went on for Jezreel and when he was come near the watchman whom Joram had sent there to spy out such as came to the city saw Jehu marching on and told Joram that he saw a troop of horsemen marching on Upon which he immediately gave orders that one of his horsemen should be sent out to meet them and to know who it was that was com ing So when the horseman came up to Jehu he asked him m what condition the army was for that the king wanted to know it but Jehu bid him not at all to meddle with such mat ters but to follow him When the watchman saw this he told Joram that the horseman had mingled himself among the com pany and came along with them And when the king had sent a second messenger Jehu commanded him to do as the former did as soon as the watchman told this also to Joram he at last got upon his chariot himself together with Ahaziah the king of Jerusalem for as we said before he was there to see how Joram did after he had been wounded as being his relation So he went out to meet Jehu who marched j slowly and in  Spanheim bere notes that this putting off men s garments and strewing them under a king was an eastern custom which he elsewhere explained t Our copies say that this driving of the chariots was like the driving of  Jehu the son of Nimshi for he driveth furiously 2 Kings ix SO whereas Josephus copy as he understood it was this trtat on the contrary Jehu marched slowly and in good order Nor can it be denied that since there was mterval enough for king Jor im to send out two horsemen one after another 22 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book IX good order and when Joram met him in the field of Naboth he asked him if all things were well in the camp but Jehu re proached him bitterly and ventured to call his mother a witch and an harlot Upon this the king fearing what he intended and suspecting he had no good meaning he turned his chariot about as soon as he could and said to Ahaziah we are fought against by deceit and treachery But Jehu drew his bow and smote him the arrow going through his heart so Joram fell down immediately on his knee and gave up the ghost Jehu also gave orders to Bidkar the captain of the third part of his army to cast the dead body of Joram into the field of Naboth putting him in mind of the prophecy which Elijah prophesied to Ahab his father when he had slain Naboth that both he and his family should perish in that place for that as tbÂ ey sat behind Ahab s chariot they heard the prophet say so and that it was now come to pass according to his prophecy Upon the fall of Joram Ahaziah was afraid of his own life and turned his chariot into another road supposing he should not be seen by Jehu but he followed after him and overtook him at a certain acclivity and drew his bow and wounded him so he left his chariot and got upon his horse and fled from Jehu to Megiddo and though he was under cure in a little time he died of that wound and was carried to Jerusalem and buried there after he had reign ed one year and had proved a wicked man and worse than his father   u  i 4Â Now when Jehu was come to Jezreel Jezebel adorned herself and stood upon a tower and said he was a fine servant that had killed his master And when he looked up to her he asked who she was and commanded her to come down to him At last he ordered the eunuchs to throw her down from the tower and being thrown down she besprinkled the wall with her blood and was trodden upon by the horses and so died When this was done Jehu came to the palace with his friends and took some refreshment after his journey both with other things and by eating a meal He also bid his servants to take up Jezebel and bury her because of the nobility of her blood for she was descended from kings but those that were appointed to bury her found nothing else remaining but the extreme parts of her body for all the rest were eaten by dogs When Jehu heard this he admired the prophecy of Elijah for he foretold that she should perish in this manner at Jezreel 5 Now Ahab had seventy sons brought up in Samaria So to Jehu and at length to go out with king Ahaziah to meet him and all this affcr he was come within eight of the watchman and before lie was come to Jczru I the probability is greatly un the side of Josephus copy or intcrpre Utiot Chap VI  ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 23 Jehu sent two epistles the one to them that brought up the chil dren the other to the rulers of Samaria which said That they should set up the most valiant of Ahab s sons for king for that they had abundance of chariots and horses and ar mour and a great army and fenced cities and that by so do ing they might avenge the murder of Ahab This he wrote t o try the intentions of those of Samaria Now when the ru lers and those that had brought up the children had read the letter they were afraid and considering that they were not at all able to oppose him and that he had already subdued two very great kings they returnedhim thisanswer That they owned him for their lord and would do whatsoever he bade them So he wrote back to them such a reply as enjoined them to obey what he gave order for and to cut off the heads of Ahab s sons and send them to him Accordingly the rulers sent for those that brought up the sons of Ahab and commanded them to slay them to cut off their heads and send them to Jehu So they did whatsoever they were commanded without omitting any thing at all and put them up in wicker baskets and sent them to Jezreel And when Jehu as he was at supper with his friends was informed that the heads of Ahab s sons were brought he ordered them to make two heaps of them one before each of the gates and in the morning he went out to take a view of them and when he saw them he began to say to the people that were present That he dkl himself make an expedition against his master Joram and slew him but that it was not he that slew all these and he desired them to take notice that as to Ahab s family all things had come to pass accord ing to God s prophecy and his house was perished according as Elijah had foretold And when he had farther destroy ed all the kindred of Ahab that were found in Jezreel he went to Samaria and as he was upon the road he met the relations of Ahaziah king of Jerusalem and asked them whether they were going they replied that they came to salute Joram and their own king Ahaziah for they knew not that he had slain them both So Jehu gave orders that they should catch these and kill them being in number forty two persons 6 After these there met him a good and a righteous man whose name was Jehonadab  and who had been his friend of old He saluted Jehu and began to commend him because he had done every thing according to the will of God in extirpating the house of Ahab So Jehu desired him to come up into his cha riot and make his entry with him into Samaria and told him That he would not spare one wicked man but would punish the false prophets and false priests and those that de ceived the multitude and persuaded them to leave the wor ship of God Almighty and to worship foreign gods  and that 5J4 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book IX it was a most excellent and most pleasing sight to a good and a righteous man to see the wicked punished So Jehonadab was persuaded by these arguments and came up into Jehu s chariot and came to Samaria And Jehu sought out for all Ahab s kindred and slew them And being desirous that none of the false prophets nor the priests of Ahab s god might es cape punishment he caught them deceitfully by this wile for he gathered all the people together and said That  he would worship twice as many gods as Ahab worshipped and desired that his priests and prophets and servants might be present because he would offer costly and great sacrifices to Ahab s god and that if any of his priests were wanting they should be punished with death Now Ahab s god was called Baal And when he had appointed a day on which he would offer those sacrifices he sent messengers through all the country of the Is raelites that they might bring the priests of Baal to him So Jehu commanded to give all the priests vestments and when they had received them he went into the house of Baal with his friend Jehonadab and gave orders to make search whether there were not any foreigner or stranger among them for he would have no one of a different religion to mix among their sacred offices And when they said that there was no stranger there and they were beginning their sacrifices he set fourscore men without they being such of his soldiers as he knew to be most faithful to him and bid them slay the prophets and now vindicate the laws of their country which had been a long time in disesteem He also threatened that if any one of them es caped their own lives should go for them So they slew them all with the sword and burnt the house of Baal and by that means purged Samaria of foreign customs idolatrous worship Now this Baal was the god of the Tyrians and Ahab in order to gratify his father in law Ethbaal who was the king of Tyre and Sidon built a temple for him in Samaria and appointed him prophets and worshipped him with all sorts of worship although tvhen this god was demolished Jehu permitted the Israelites to worship the golden heifers However because he had done thus and taken care to punish the wicked God foretold by his pro phet that his sons should reign over Israel for four generations And in this condition was Jehu at this time CHAP VII flow Athaliah reigned over Jerusalem for Jive six years when Jehoiada the high priest slew her and made Jehoash the son of Ahaziah king Â 1 jN ow when Atnaliah the daughter of Ahab heard of the death of her brother Jnram and of her son Ahaziah Chap VII ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 25 and of the royal family she endeavoured that none of the house of David might be left alive but that the whole family might be exterminated that no king might arise out of it after ward and as she thought she had actually done it but one of Ahaziah s sons was preserved who escaped death after the man ner following Ahaziah had a sister by the same father whose name was Jehosheba and she was married to the high priest Je hoiada She went into the king s palace and found Jehoash for that was the little child s name who was not above a year old among those that were slain but concealed with his nurse so she took him with her into a secret bed chamber and shut him up there and she and her husband Jehoiada brought him up privately in the temple six years during which time Athaliah reigned over Jerusalem and the two tribes 2 Now on the seventh year Jehoiada communicated the matter to certain of the captains of hundreds five in number and persuaded them to be assisting to what attempts he was making against Athaliah and to join with him in asserting the kingdom to the child He also received such oaths from them as are proper to secure those that assist one another from the fear of discovery and he was then of good hope that they should depose Athaliah Now those men whom Jehoiada the priest had taken to be his partners went into all the country and gathered together the priests and the Levites and the heads of the tribes out of it and came and brought them to Jerusalem to the high priest So he demanded the security of an oath of them to keep private whatsoever he should discover to them which required both their silence and their assistance So when they had taken the oath and had thereby made it safe for him to speak he pro duced the child that he had brought up of the family of David and said to them This is your king of that house which you know God hath foretold should reign over you for all time to come I exhort you therefore that one third part of you guard him in the temple and that a fourth part keep watch at all the gates of the temple and that the next part of you keep guard at the gate which opens and leads to the king s palace and let the rest of the multitude be unarmed in the temple and let no armed person go into the temple but the priest only He also gave them this order besides that a  part of the priests and the Levites should be about the king himself and be a guard to him with their drawn swords and to kill that man immediately whoever he be that should be so bold as to enter armed into the temple and bid them be afraid of nobody but persevere in guarding the king So these men obeyed what the high priest advised them to and declared the reality of their resolution by their actions Jehoiada 26 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book IX also opened that armoury which David had made in the temple and distributed to the captains of hundreds as also to the priests and Levites all the spears and quivers and what kind of weapons soever it contained and set them armed in a circle round about the temple so as to touch one another s hands and by that means excluding those from entering that ought not to enter So they brought the child into the midst of them and put on him the royal crown and Jehoiada anointed him with the oil and made him king and the multitude rejoiced and made a noise and cried God save the king 3 When Athaliah unexpectedly heard the tumult and the acclamations she was greatly disturbed in her mind and sud denly issued out of the royal palace with her own army and when she was come to the temple the priests received her but as for those that stood round about the temple as they were ordered by the high priest to do they hindered the armed men that followed her from going in But when Athaliah saw the child standing upon a pillar with the royal crown upon his head she rent her clothes and cried out vehemently and commanded her guards to kill him that had laid snares for her and endea voured to deprive her of the government But Jehoiada called for the captains of hundreds and commanded them to bring Athaliah to the valley of Cedron and slay her there for he would not have the temple defiled with the punishment of this pernicious woman  and he gave order that if any one came near to help her he should be slain also wherefore those that had the charge of her slaughter took hold of her and led her to the gate of the kings mules and slew her there 4 Now as soon as what concerned Athaliah was by this stratagem after this manner despatched Jehoiada called together the people and the armed men into the temple and made them take an oath that they would be obedient to the king and take care of his safety and of the safety of his government after which he obliged the king to give security upon oath that he would worship God and not transgress the laws of Moses They then ran to the house of Baal which Athaliah and her husband Jehoram had built to the dishonour of the God of their fathers and to the honour of Ahab and demolished it and slew Matan that had his priesthood But Jehoiada entrusted the care and Custody of the temple to the priests and Levites according to the appointment of king David and enjoined them to bring their regular burnt offerings twice a day and to offer incense according to the law He also ordained some of the Levites with the porters to be a guard to the temple that no one ths was defiled might come there 5 And when Jehoiada had set these things in order he with Chap VIII ANTIQUITIES OK THE JEWS 27 i the captains of hundreds and the rulers and all the people took Jehoash out of the temple into the king s palace and when he had set him into the king s throne the people shouted for joy and betook themselves to feasting and kept a festival for many days but the city was quiet upon the death of Athaliah Now Jehoash was seven years old when he took the kingdom His mother s name was Zibiah of the city Beersheba And all the time that Jehoiada lived Jehoash was careful that the laws should be kept and very zealous in the worship of God and when he was of age he married two wives who were given to him by the high priest by whom were born to him both sons and daughters And thus much shall suffice to have related con cerning king Jehoash how he escaped the treachery of Athaliah and how he received the kingdom CHAP VIII Haxael makes an expedition against the people of Israel and the inhabitants of Jerusalem Jehu dies and Jehoahaz succeeds in the government Jehoash the king of Jerusalem atjirst is careful about the worship of God but afterwards becomes impious and commands Zachariah to be stoned When Jehoash king ofjudah was dead Amaziah succeeds him in the king dom  1 Now Hazael king of Syria fought against the Israel ites and their king Jehu and spoiled the eastern parts of the country beyond Jordan which belonged to the Reubenites and Gadites and to the half tribe of Manassites as also Gilead and Bashan burning and spoiling and offering violence to all that he laid his hands on and this without impeachment from Jehu who made no haste to defend the country when it was under this distress nay he was become a contemner of reli gion and a despiser of holiness and of the laws and died when he had reigned over the Israelites twenty seven years He was buried in Samaria  and left Jehoahaz his son his successor in the government 2 Now Jehoash king of Jerusalem had an inclination to re pair the temple of God so he called Jehoiada and bid him send the Levites and priests through all the country to require half a shekel of silver for every head towards the rebuilding and re pairing of the temple which was brought to decay by Jehoram and Athaliah and her sons But the high priest did not do this as concluding that no one would willingly pay the money but on the twenty third year of Jehoash s reign when the king sent forhim and the Levites and complained that they had not obeyed what he enjoined them and still commanded them to take care VOL iI u 15 28 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEN S Book IX of the rebuilding the temple he used this stratagem for collect ing the money with which the multitude was pleased He made a wooden chest and closed it up fast on all sides but opened one hole in it he then set it in the temple beside the altar and de sired every one to cast into it through the hole what he pleased for the repair of the temple This contrivance was acceptable to the people and they strove one with another and brought in jointly large quantities of silver and gold and when the scribe and the priest that were over the treasuries had emptied the chest and counted the money in the king s presence they then set it in its former place and thus did they every day But when the multitude appeared to have cast in as much as was wanted the high priest Jehoiada and king Jehoash sent to hire masons and carpenters and to buy large pieces of timber and of the most curious sort and when they had repaired the tem ple they made use of the remaining gold and silver which was not a little for bowls and basons and cups and other vessels and they went on to make the altar every day fat with sacrifices of great value And these things were taken suitable care of as long as Jehoiada Jived 3 But as soon as he was dead which was when he had lived one hundred and thirty years having been a righteous nnd in every respect a very good man he was buried in the king s se pulchre at Jerusalem because he had recovered the kingdom to the family of David king Jehoash betrayed his want of care about God The principal men of the people were corrupted also together with him and offended against their duty and what their constitution determined to be most for their good Here upon God was displeased with the change that was made on the king and on the rest of the people and sent prophets to testify to them what their actions were and to bring them to leave off their wickedness but they had gotten such a strong affection and so violent an inclination to it that neither could the exam ples of those that had offered affronts to the laws and had been so severely punished they and their entire families nor could the fear of what the prophets now foretold bring them to repentance and turn them back from their course of transgres sion to their former duty But the king commanded that Za chariah the son of the high priest Jehoiada should be stoned to death in the temple and forgot the kindnesses he had received from his father for when God had appointed him to prophesy he stood in the midst of the multitude and gave this counsel to them and to the king that they should act righteously and fore told to them that if they would not hearken to his admonitions they should suffer a heavy punishment But as Zachariah was ready to die he appealed to God as a witness of what he suffer Chap VIII ANTIQUITIES OF THE jtws 29  ed for the good counsel he had given them and how he perish ed after a most severe and violent manner for the good deeds his father had done to Jehoash 4 However it was not long before the king suffered punish ment for his transgression for when Hazael king of Syria made an irruption into his country and when he had overthrown Gath and spoiled it he made an expedition against Jerusalem upon which Jehoash was afraid and emptied all the treasures of God and of the kings before him and took down the gifts that had been dedicated in the temple and sent them to the king of Syria and procured so much by them that he was not besieged nor his kingdom quite endangered but Hazael was in duced by the greatness of the sum of money not to bring his ar my against Jerusalem yet Jehoash fell into a severe distempter and was set upon by his friends in order to revenge the death of Zachariah the son of Jehoiada These laid snares for the king and slew him He was indeed buried in Jerusalem but not in the royal sepulchres of his forefathers because of his impiety He lived forty seven years and Amaziah his son succeeded him in the kingdom 5 In the one and twentieth year of the reign of Jehoash Je hoahaz the son of Jehu took the government of the Israelites in Samaria and held it seventeen years He did not properly imitate his father but was guilty of as wicked practices as those that first had God in contempt but the king of Syria brought him low and by an expedition against him did so greatly reduce his forces that there remained no more of so great an army than ten thousand armed men and fifty horsemen He also took away from him his great cities and many of them also and destroyed his army And these were the things that the people of Israel suffered according to the prophecy of Elisha when he foretold that Hazael would kill his master and reign over the  Syrians and Damascenes But when Jehoahaz was under such unavoidable miseries he had recourse to prayer and supplication to God and besought him to deliver him out of the hands of Hazael and not overlook him and give him up into his hands Accordingly God accepted of his repentance instead of virtue and being desirous rather to admonish those that might repent and not to determine that they should be utterly destroyed he granted him deliverance from wars and dangers So the country having obtained peace returned again to its former condition and flourished as before 6 Now after the death of Jehoahaz his son Joash took the kingdom in the thirty seventh year of Jehoash the king of the tribe of Judak This Joash then took the kingdom of Israel in Samaria for he had the same name with the king of Jerusalem 30 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book IX and he retained the kingdom sixteen years He was a  good man and in his disposition was not at all like his father Now at this time it was that when Elisha the prophet who was already very old and was now fallen into a disease the king of Israel came to visit him and when he found him very near death he be gan to weep in his sight and lament to call him his father and his weapons because it was by his means that he never made use of his weapons against his enemies but that he over came his own adversaries by his prophecies without fighting and that he was now departing this life and leaving him to the Syrians that were already armed and to other enemies of his that were under their power so he said it was not safe for hun to live any longer but that it would be well for him to hasten to his end and depart out of this life with him As the king was thus bemoaning himself Elisha comforted him and bid the king bend a bow that was brought him and when the king had fitted the bow for shooting Elisha tookhold of his hands and bid him shoot and when he had shot three arrows and then left off Elisha said  If thou hadst shot more arrows thou hadst cut the kingdom of Syria up by the roots but since thou hast been satisfied with shooting three times only thou shalt fight and beat the Syrians no more times than three that thou may est recover that country which they cut off from thy king dom in the reign of thy father So when the king had heard that he departed and a little while after the prophet died He was a man celebrated for righteousness and in eminent favour with God He also performed wonderful and surprising works by prophesy and such as were gloriously preserved in memory by the Hebrews He also obtained a magnificent funeral such a one indeed as it was fit a person so beloved of God should have Jt also happened that at that time certain robbers cast a man whom they had slain into Elisha s grave and upon his dead body  This character of Joash the son of Jehoahaz that he was a good man and in his disposition not at all like to his father seems a direct contradiction to our ordinary copies which say 2 Kings xiii 11 that he did evil in the sight of the Lord and that he departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat who wade Israel to sin he walked therein Which copies are here the truest it is hard positively to determine If Josephus be true this Jo ash is the single instance of a good king over the ten tribes If the other be true we have not one such example The account that follows in all copies of Elisha he prophet s concern for him and his concern for Elisha greatly favour Josephus copies and suppose this king to have been then a good man and no idolater with whom God s piophets used not to be so familiar Upon the whole since it appears even by Josephus own account that Amaziah the good king of Judah while he was a good king was forbidden to make use of the 100 000 auxiliaries he had of this Joash the king of Israel as if he and they were then idolaters 2 Chron xxv 6â 9 It is most likely that these different characters of Joash suited the different parts of his reign and that according to our common copies he was at first a wicked king and afterwards was reclaimed and became a good one according to Josephus Chap IX ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS SI coming close to Elisha s body it revived again And thus far have we enlarged about the actions of Elisha the prophet both such as he did while he was alive and how he had a divine power after his death also 7 Now upon the death of Hazael the king of Syria that kingdom came to Adad his son with whom Joash king of Israel made war and when he had beaten him in three battles he took from him all that country and all those cities and villages which his father Hazael had taken from the kingdom of Israel which came to pass however according to the prophecy of Eli sha But when Joash happened to die he was buried in Sama ria and the government devolved on his son Jeroboam CHAP IX Haw Amaziah made an expedition against the Edamites and Amalekites and conquered them  but when he afterwards made War against Joash he was beaten and not long after was slain and Uzziah succeeded in the government Â 1 JN ow in the second year of the reign of Joash over Is rael Amaziah reigned over the tribe of Judah at Jerusalem His mother s name was Jehohaddan who was born at Jerusa lem He was exceeding careful in doing what was right and this when he was very young but when he came to the man agement of affairs and to the government he resolved that he ought first of all to avenge his father Jehoash and to punish those his friends that had laid violent hands upon him so he seized upon them all and put them to death yet did he execute no severity on their children but acted therein according to the laws of Moses who did not think it just to punish children for the sins of their fathers After this he chose him an army out of the tribe of Judah and Benjamin of such as were in the flower of their age and about twenty years old and when he had collected about three hundred thousand of them together he set captains of hundreds over them He also sent to the king of Israel and hired an hundred thousand of his soldiers for an hun dred talents of silver for he had resolved to make an expedition against the nations of the Amalekites and Edomites and Geba lites But as he was preparing for his expedition and ready to go out to the war a prophet gave him counsel to dismiss the army of the Israelites because they were bad men and because God foretold that he should be beaten if he made use of them as auxiliaries but that he should overcome his enemies though he had but a few soldiers when it so pleased God And when the king grudged at his having already paid the hire of the Israelites the prophet exhorted him to do what God would have him be 3 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book IX cause he should thereby obtain much wealth from God So he dismissed them and said that he still freely gave them their pay and went himself with his own army and made war with the nations before mentioned and when he had beaten them in bat tle he slew of them ten thousand and took as many prisoners alive whom he brought to the great rock which is in Arabia and threw them down from it headlong He also brought away a great deal of prey and vast riches from those nations But while Amaziah was engaged in this expedition those Israelites whom he had hired and then dismissed were very uneasy at it and taking their dismission for an affront as supposing that this would not have been done to them but out of contempt the 7 fell upon his kingdom and proceeded to spoil the country as far as Beth horon and took much cattle and slew three thousand men 2 Now upon the victory which Amaziah had gotten and the great acts he had done he was puffed up and began to overlook God who had given him the victory and proceeded to worship the gods he had brought out of the country of the Amalekites So a prophet came to him and said That he wondered how he could esteem these to be gods who had been of no advan tage to their own people who paid them honours nor had de livered them from his hand but had overlooked the destruc tion of many of them and had suffered themselves to be car ried captive for that they had been carried to Jerusalem in the same manner as any one might have taken some of the enemy alive and led them thither This reproof provoked the king to anger and he commanded the prophet to hold his peace and threatened to punish him if he meddled with his conduct So he replied That he should indeed hold his peace but foretold withal that God would not overlook his attempts for innovation But Amaziah was not able to contain him self under that prosperity which God had given him although he had affronted God thereupon but in a vein of insolence he wrote to Joash the king of Israel and commanded that he and all his people should be obedient to him as they had formerly been obedient to his progenitors David and Solo mon and he let him know that if he would not be so wise as to do what he commanded him he must fight for his do minion To which message Joash returned this answer in writing King Joash to king Amaziah There was a vastly tall cypress tree in mount Lebanon as also a thistle this thistle sent to the cypress tree to give the cypress tree s daughter in marriage to the thistle s son but as the thistle was saying this there came a wild beast and trode down the thistle And this may be a lesson to thee not to be so am bitious and to have a care lest upon thy good success in the Chap X ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 33 fight against the Amalekites thou growest so proud as to bring dangers upon thyself and upon thy kingdom 3 When Amaziah had read this letter he was more eager upon this expedition which I suppose was by the impulse of God that he might be punished for his offence against him But as soon as he led out his army against Joash and they were go ing to join battle with him there came such a fear and conster nation upon the army of Amaziah as God when he is displeas ed sends upon men anddiscomfitted them even before they came to a close fight Now it happened that as they were scattered about by the terror that was upon them Amaziah was left alone and was taken prisoner by the enemy whereupon Joash threat ened to kill him unless he would persuade the people of Jeru salem to open their gates to him and receive him and his army into the city Accordingly Amaziah was so distressed and in such fear of his life that he made his enemy to be received into the city So Joash overthrew a part of the wall of the length of four hundred cubits and drove his chariot through the breach into Jerusalem and led Amaziah captive along with him by which means he became master of Jerusalem and took away the treasures of God and carried off all the gold and silver that was in the king s palace and then freed the king from captivity and returned to Samaria Now these things happened to the people of Jerusalem in the fourteenth year of the reign of Amaziah who after this had a conspiracy made against him by his friends and fled to the city Lachish and was there slain by the conspi rators who sent men thither to kill him So they took up his dead body and carried it to Jerusalem and made a royal funeral for him This was the end of the life of Amaziah because of his innovations in religion and his contempt of God when he had lived fifty four years and had reigned twenty nine He was succeeded by his son whose name was Uzziah CHAP X Concerning Jeroboam king of Israel and Jonah the prophet and hovo after the death of Jeroboam his son Zechariah took the government How Uzziah king of Jerusalem subdued the nations that were round about him and what befell him when he attempted to offer incense to God f 1 IN the fifteenth year of the reign of Amaziah Jero boam the son of Joash reigned over Israel and Samaria forty years The king was guilty of  contumely against God and  What I have above noted concerning Jehoash seems to me to have been me also concerning his son Jeroboam 11 viz that although he began wickcdlv 3 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book IX became very wicked in worshipping of idols and in many un dertakings that were absurd and foreign He was also the cause of ten thousand misfortunes to the people of Israel Now one Jonah a prophet foretold to him that he should make war with the Syrians and conquer their army and enlarge the bounds of his kingdom on the northern parts to the city Hamath and on the southern to the lake Asphaltitis for the bounds of the Canaanites originally were these as Joshua their general had determined them So Jeroboam made an expedition against the Syrians and overran all their country as Jonah had foretold 2 Now I cannot but think it necessary for me who have pro mised to give an accurate account of our affairs to describe the actions of the prophet so far as I have found them written down in the Hebrew books Jonah had been commanded by God to go to the kingdom of Nineveh and when he was there to publish it in that city how it should lose the dominion it had over the nations But he went not out of fear nay he ran away from God to the city of Joppa and finding a ship there he went into it and sailed to  Tarsus in Cilicia and upon the rise of a most terrible storm which was so great that the ship was in danger of sinking the mariners the master and the pi lot himself made prayers and vows in case they escaped the sea but Jonah lay still and covered in the ship without imitating any thing that the others did but as the waves grew greater and the sea became more violent by the winds they suspected as is usual in such cases that some one of the persons that sailed with them was the occasion of this storm and agreed to discover by lot which of them it was When they had f cast lots the as Josephus agrees with our other copies and as he adds was the cause of a vast number of misfortunes to the Israelites in those his first years the particulars of which are unhappily wanting both in Josephus and in all our copies so does it seem to me that he was afterwards reclaimed and became a good king and so was encouraged by the prophet Jonah and had great successes afterward when God had saved the Israelites by the hand of Jeroboam the son of Joash 2 Kings xiv 27 which encouragement by Jonah and great successes are equally observable in Josephus and in the other copies  When Jonah is said in our Bibles to have gone to Tarshish Jonah i 3 Jo sephus understood it that he went to Tarshish in Cilicia or to ihe Mediterranean Sta upon which Tarsus lay so that he docs not appear to have read the text J Kings xxii 48 as our copies do that ships of Tarshish could lie at Ezion Ge ber upon the Red Sea But as to Josephus assertion that Jonah s fish was carried by the strength of the current upon a storm as far as the F uxine Sea it is no way impossible and since the storm might have driven the ship while Jonah was in it near to the Euxine Sea and since in three more days while he was in the fish s belly that current might bring him to the Assyrian coast and since withal that coast could bring him nearer to Nineveh than could any coast of the Mediter ranean it is by no means an improbable determination in Josephus f Thi s ancient piece of religion of supposing there was great tin where there v as great misery and of casting lots to discover great sinners not only among Chap X ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 35 lot fell upon the prophet and when they asked him Whence he came and what he had done  he replied That he was an He brew by nation and a prophet of Almighty God and he per suaded them to cast him into the sea if they would escape the danger they were in for that he was the occasion of the storm which was upon them Now at the first they durst not do so as esteeming it a wicked thing to cast a man who was a stranger and who had committed his life to them into such manifest per dition but at last when their misfortune overbore them and the ship was just going to be drowned and when they were ani mated to do it by the prophet himself and by the fear concern ing their own safety they cast him into the sea upon which the sea became calm It is also related that Jonah was swallowed down by a whale and that when he had been there three days and as many nights he was vomited out upon the Euxine Sea and this alive and without any hurt upon his body and there on his prayer to God he obtained pardon for his sins and went to the city Nineveh where he stood so as to be heard and preached That in a very little time they should lose the dominion of Asia And when he had published this he returned Now I have given the account about him as I found it written in our books 3 When Jeroboam the king had passed his life in great happi ness and had ruled forty years he died and was buried in Sa maria and his son Zechariah took the kingdom After the same manner did Uzziah the son of Amaziah begin to reign over the two tribes in Jerusalem in the fourteenth year of the reign of Jeroboam He was born of Jecoliah his mother who was a citizen of Jerusalem He was a good man and by nature right eous and magnanimous and very laborious in taking care of the affairs of his kingdom He made an expedition also against the Philistines and overcame them in battle and took the cities of Gath and Jabneh and brake down their walls after which expedition he assaulted those Arabs that adjoined to Egypt He also built a city upon the Red Sea and put a garrison into it He after this overthrew the Ammonites and appointed that they should pay tribute He also overcame all the countries as far as to the bounds of Egypt and then began to take care of Jerusalem itself for the rest of his life for he rebuilt and re paired all those parts of the wall which had either fallen down the Israelites but among these heathen mariners seems a remarkable remains of the ancient tradition which prevailed of old over all mankind that providence used to interpose visibly in all human affairs and never to bring or at least not long to continue notorious judgments but for notorious sins which the most ancient book of Job shows to have been the state of mankind for about the former 3000 years of the world till the days of Job and Moses VOL II E 15 36 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book IX by length of time or by the carelessness of the kings his prede cessors as well as all that part which had been thrown down by the king of Israel when he took his father Amaziah prisoner and entered with him into the city Moreover he built a great many towers of one hundred and fifty cubits high and built walled towns in desert places and put garrisons into them and dug many channels for conveyance of water He had also many beasts for labour and an immense number of cattle for his country was fit for pasturage He was also given to husbandry and took care to cultivate the ground and planted it with all sorts of plants and sowed it with all sorts of seeds He had also about him an army composed of chosen men in number three hundred and seventy thousand who were governed by general officers and captains of thousands who were men of valour and of unconquerable strength in number two thousand He also divided his whole army into bands and armed them giving every one a sword with brazen bucklers and breast plates with bows and slings and besides these he made for them many en gines of war for besieging of cities such as cast stones and darts with grapplers and other instruments of that sort 4 While Uzziah was in this state and making preparation for futurity he was corrupted in his mind by pride and be came insolent and this on account of that abundance which he had of things that will soon perish and despised that power which is of eternal duration which consisted in piety towards God and in the observation of his laws so he fell by occasion of the good success of his affairs and was carried headlong into those sins of his fathers which the splendour of that prosperity he enjoyed and the glorious actions he had done led him into while he was not able to govern himself well about them Ac cordingly when a remarkable day was come and a general festi val was to be celebrated he put on the holy garment and went into the temple to offer incense to God upon the golden altar which he was prohibited to do by Azariah the high priest who had fourscore priests with him and who told him that it was not lawful for him to offer sacrifice and that  none besides the posterity of Aaron were permitted so to do And when they  cried out that he must go out of the temple and not transgress  against God he was wroth at them and threatened to kill them unless they would hold their peace In the mean time a great  earthquake shook the ground and a rent was made in the tem  This account of an earthquake at Jerusalem at the very same time when Uzziab usurped the priest s office and went into the sanctuary to burn incense and of ihc consequences of that earthquake is entirely wanting in our other copies though it be exceeding like to a prophecy of Jeremiah s now in Zech xiv 5 in which prophecy mention is made of  fleeing from that earthquake Chap XI ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 37 pie and the bright rays of the sun shone through it and fell up on the king s face insomuch that the leprosy seized upon him immediately And before the city at a place called Eroge half the mountain broke off from the rest on the west and rolled it self four furlongs and stood still at the east mountain till the roads as well as the king s gardens were spoiled by the ob struction Now as soon as the priests saw that the king s face was infected with the leprosy they told him of the calamity he was under and commanded that he should go out of the city as a polluted person Hereupon he was so confounded at the sad distemper and sensible that he was not at liberty to contradict that he did as he was commanded and underwent this miserable and terrible punishment for an intention beyond what befitted a man to have and for that impiety against God which was im plied therein So he abode out of the city for some time and lived a private life while his son Jotham took the government after which he died with grief and anxiety at what had happened to him when he had lived sixty eight years and reigned of them fifty two and was buried by himself in his own gardens CHAP XI  How Zechariah Shallum Menahem Pekahiah and Pekah took the government over the Israelites and how Pul and Tiglath Pileser made an expedition against the Israelites How Jo tham the son of Uzziah reigned over the tribe of Judah and what things Nahum prophesied against the Assyrians Â 1 N ow when Zechariah the son of Jeroboam had reign ed six months over Israel he was slain by the treachery of a certain friend of his whose name was Shallum the son of Ja besh who took the kingdom afterward but kept it no longer than thirty days for Menahem the general of nis army who was at that time in the city Tirzah and heard of what had be fallen Zechariah removed thereupon with all his forces to Sa maria and joining battle with Shallum slew him and when he had made himself king he went thence and came to the city Tiphsah but the citizens that were in it shut their gates and barred them against the king and would not admit him but in order to be avenged on them he burnt the country round about it and took the city by force upon a siege and being ve ry much displeased at what the inhabitants of Tiphsah had done he slew them all and spared not so much as the infants without as they fled from this earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah so that there seems to have been some considerable resemblance between these historical and prophetical earthquakes 88 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book IX omitting the utmost instances of cruelty and barbarity for he used such severity upon his own countrymen as would not be pardonable with regard to strangers who had been conquered by him And after this manner it was that this Menahem con tinued to reign with cruelty and barbarity for ten years But when Pul king of Assyria had made an expedition against him he did not meet to fight or engage in battle with the Assyrians but he persuaded him to accept of a thousand talents of silver and to go away and so put an end to the war This sum the multitude collected for Menahem by  exacting fifty drachmae as poll money for every head after which he died and was buried in Samaria and left his son Pekahiah his successor in the kingdom who followed the barbarity of his father and so ruled but two years only after which he was slain with his friends at a feast by the treachery of one Peknh the general of his horse and the son of Remaliah who laid snares for him Now this Pekah held the government twenty years and proved a wicked man and a transgressor But the king of Assyria whose name was Tiglath Pilcser when he had made an expedi tion against the Israelites and had overrun all the land of Gi lead and the region beyond Jordan and the adjoining country which is called Galilee and Kadesh and Hazor he made the in habitants prisoners and transplanted them into his own king dom And so much shall suffice to have related here concerning the king of Assyria 2 Now Jotham the son of Uzziah reigned over the tribe of Ju dah in Jerusalem being a citizen thereof by his mother whose name was Jerusha This king was not defective in any virtue but was religious towards God and righteous towards men and careful of the good of the city for what parts soever wanted to be repaired or adorned he magnificently repaired and adorned them He also took care of the foundations of the cloisters in the temple and repaired the walls that were fallen down and built very great towers and such as were almost impregnable and if any thing else in his kingdom had been neglected he took great care of it He also made an expedition against the Ammon ites and overcame them in battle and ordered them to pay  Dr Wall in hk critical notes on 2 Kings xv 20 observes That when this Menahem is said to have exacted the money of Israel of all the mighty men of wealth of each man 50 shekels of silver to give Pul the king of Assy ria 1000 talents this is the first public money raised by any Israelite king by tax on the people that they used before to raise it out of the treasures A the house of the Lord or of their own house that it was a poll money on the rich men and them only to raise Â 353 000 or as others count a talent Â 400 000 at the rate of Â 6 or Â 7 per head and that God commanded by Eze kiel chap xlv 8 and xlvi 18 that no such thing should be done fat the Jews restoration but the king should hare land of his own Chap XII ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 39 tribute a hundred talents and ten thousand cori of wheat and as many of barley every year and so augmented his kingdom that his enemies could not despise it and his own people lived happily 3 Now there was at that time a prophet whose name was Na hum who spake after this manner concerning the overthrow of the Assyrians and Nineveh  Nineveh shall be a pool of water in motion so shall all her people be troubled and toss ed and go away by flight while they say one to another Stand stand still seize their gold and silver for there shall be no one to wish them well for they will rather save their lives than their money for a terrible contention shall possess them one with another and lamentation and loosing of the members and their countenances shall be perfectly black with fear And there will be the den of the lions and the mother of the young lions God says to thee Nineveh that they shall de face thee and the lion shall no longer go out from thee to give laws to the world And indeed this prophet prophesied many other things besides these concerning Nineveh which I do not think necessary to repeat and I here omit them that I may not appear troublesome to my readers all which things hap pened about Nineveh a hundred and fifteen years afterwards so this may suffice to have spoken of these matters CHAP XII Haw upon the death of Jotham Ahaz reigned in

principal or rather the only one that is given us almost verbatim but a little abridged in all Josephus known writings By which quotation we learn that he himself always asserts viz that he made use of the Hebrew original and not of the Greek vertionl  as also we learn that his Hebrew copy consider ably differed from ours See all three texts particularly set down and compared together in the Essay on the Old Test page 187 40 ANTIQUITIES OP THE JEWS Book IX also of the same sort Now as he was going on in this mad course Rezin the king of Syria and Damascus and Pekah the king ot Israel who were now at amity one with another made war with him and when they had driven him into Jerusalem they besieg ed that city a long while making but a small progress on ac count of the strength of its walls and when the king of Syria had taken the city Elath upon the Red Sea and had slain the inhabitants he peopled it with Syrians and when he had slain those in the other garrisons and the Jews in their neighbour hood and had driven away much prey he returned with his ar my back to Damascus Now when the king of Jerusalem knew that the Syrians were returned home he supposing himself a match for the king of Israel drew out his army against him and joining battle with him was beaten and this happened because God was angry with him on account of his many and great enormities Accordingly there was slain by the Israelites one hundred and twenty thousand of his men that day whose gene ral Amaziah by name slew Zechariah the king s son in his con flict with Ahaz as well as the governor of the kingdom whose name was Azricam He also carried Elcanah the general of the troops of the tribe of Judah into captivity They also car ried the women and children of the tribe of Benjamin captives and when they had gotten a great deal of prey they returned to Samaria 2 Now there was one Obed who was a prophet at that time in Samaria he met the army before the city walls and with a loud voice told them  that they had gotten the victory not by their own strength but by reason of the anger Godhad against king Ahaz And he complained that they were not satisfied with the good success they had against him but were so bold as to make captives out of their kinsmen the tribe of Ju dah and Benjamin He also gave them counsel to let them go home without doing them any harm for that if they did not obey God herein they should be punished So the people of Israel came together to their assembly and considered of these matters when a man whose name was Berechiah and who was one of chief reputation in the government stood up and three others with him and said  We will not suffer the citizens to bring these prisoners into the city lest we all be destroyed by God we have sins enough of our own that we have commit ted against him as the prophets assure us nor ought we therefore to introduce the practice of new crimes When the soldiers heard that they permitted them to do what they thought best So the forenamed man took the captives and let them go and took care of them and gave them provisions and sent them to their own country without doing them any harm Chap XIII ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 41 However these four went along with them and conducted them as far as Jericho which is not far from Jerusalem and return ed to Samaria 3 Hereupon king Ahaz having been so thoroughly beaten by the Israelites sent to Tiglath Pileser king of the Assyrians and sued for assistance from him in his war against the Israel ites and Syrians and Damascenes with a promise to send him much money he sent him also great presents at the same time Now this king upon the reception of those ambassadors came to Â ssist Ahaz and made war upon the Syrians and laid their country waste and took Damascus by force and slew Rezin their king and transplanted the people of Damascus into the upper Media and brought a colony of Assyrians and planted them in Damascus He also afflicted the land of Israel and took many captives out of it While he was doing thus with the Syrians king Ahaz took all the gold that was in the king s treasures and the silver and what was in the temple of God and what precious gifts were there and he carried them with him and came to Damascus and gave it to the king of Assy ria according to his agreement So he confessed that he owed him thanks for all they had done for him and returned to Jeru salem Now this king was so sottish and thoughtless of what was for his own good that he would not leave off worshipping the Syrian gods when he was beaten by them but he went on in worshipping them as though they would procure him the victory and when he was beaten again he began to honour the gods of the Assyrians and he seemed more desirous to honour any other gods than his own paternal and true God whose anger was the cause of his defeat nay he proceeded to such a degree of despite and contempt of God s worship that he shut up the temple entirely and forbade them to bring in their appointed sacrifices and took away the gifts that had been given to it And when he had offered these indignities to God he died having lived thirty six years and of them reigned sixteen and he left his son Hezekiah for his successor CHAP XIII HowPeJcah died by the treachery of Hoshea who was a little af ter subdued by Shalmaneser And how Hezekiah reigned in stead of Ahaz  and what actions of piety and justice he did J 1 ABOUT the same tune Pekah the king of Israel died by the treachery of a friend of his whose name was Hoshea who retained the kingdom nine years time but was a wicked 42 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book IX man and a despiser of the divine worship And Shalmaneser the king of Assyria made an expedition against him and over came him which must have been because he had not God fa vourable or assistant to him and brought him to submission and ordered him to pay an appointed tribute Now in the fourth year of the reign of Hoshea Hezekiah the son of Ahaz began to reign in Jerusalem and his mother s name was Abi jah a citizen of Jerusalem His nature was good and right eous and religious for when he came to the kingdom he thought that nothing was prior or more necessary or more advantageous to himself and to his subjects than to worship God Accordingly he called the people together and the priests and the Levites and made a speech to them and said you are not ignorant how by the sins of my father who transgressed that sacred honour which was due to God you have had experience of many and great miseries while you were corrupted in your mind by him and were induced to worship those which he supposed to be gods I exhort you therefore who have learned by sad experience how danger ous a thing impiety is to put that immediately out of your memory and to purify yourselves from your former pollu tions and to open the temple to these priests and Levites who are here convened and to cleanse it with the accustom ed sacrifices and to recover all to the ancient honour which   our fathers paid to it for by this means we may render God favourable and he will remit the anger he hath had to us 2 When the king had said this the priests opened the temple and when they had set in order the vessels of God and cast out what was impure they laid the accustomed sacrifices upon the al tar The king also sent to the country that was under him and called the people to Jerusalem to celebrate the feast of unleaven ed bread for it had been intermitted a long time on account of the wickedness of the forementioned kings He also sent to the Israelites and exhorted them to leave off their present way of living and return to their ancient practices and to worship God for that he gave them leave to come to Jerusalem and to celebrate all in one body the feast of unleavened bread and this he said was by way of invitation only and to be done of their own good will and for their own advantage and not out of obedience to him because it would make them happy But the Israelites upon the coming of the ambassadors and up on their laying before them what they had in charge from their own king were so far from complying therewith that they laughed the ambassadors to scorn and mocked them as fools as also they affronted the prophets which gave them the same exhortations and foretold what they would suffer if they did not return to the worship of God insomuch that at length they Chap XIII ATmyvmES OF THE JEWS 4S caught them and slew them nor did this degree of transgress ing suffice them but they had more wicked contrivances than what have been described Nor did they leave off before God as a punishment for their impiety brought them under their enemies but of that more hereafter However many there werÂ of the tribe of Manasseh and of Zebulon and of Issachar wh t were obedient to what the prophets exhorted them to do and returned to the worship of God Now all these came running to Jerusalem to Hezekiah that they might worship God there 3 Where these men were come king Hezekiah went up into the temple with the rulers and all the people and offered for himself seven bulls and as many rams with seven lambs and as many kids of the goats The king also himself and the rulers laid their hands on the heads of the sacrifices and perrnitted tha priests to complete the sacred offices about them So they both slew the sacrifices and burnt the burnt offerings while the Le vites stood round about them with their musical instruments and sang hymns to God and played on their psalteries as they were instructed by David to do and this while the rest of the priests returned the music and sounded the trumpets which they had in their hands  and when this was done the king and the multitude threw themselves down upon their face and wor shipped God He also sacrificed seventy bulls one hundred rams and two hundred lambs He also granted the multitude sacrifices to feast upon six hundred oxen and three thousand other cattle and the priests performed all things according to the law Now the king was so pleased herewith that he feasted with the people and returned thanks to God But as the feast of unleavened bread was now come when they had offered that sacrifice which is called the Passover they after that offered other sacrifices for seven days  When the king had bestowed on the multitude besides what they sanctified of themselves two thousand bulls and seven thousand other cattle the same thing was done by the rulers for they gave them a thousand bulls and a thousand and forty other cattle Nor had this festival been so well observed from the days of king Solomon as it was now first observed with great splendour and magnificence and when the festival was ended they went out into the country and purged it and cleansed the city of all the pollution of the idols The king also gave order that the daily sacrifice should be offer ed at his own charges and according to the law  and appoint ed that the tythes and the first fruits should be given by the multitude to the priests and Levites that they might constantly attend tipon divine service and never be taken off from the wor ship of God Accordingly the multitude brought together all VOL II I 17 44 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book IX sorts of their fruits to the priests and the Levites The king also made garners and receptacles for these fruits and distribut ed them to every one of their priests and Levites and to their children and wives And thus did they return to their old form of divine worship Now when the king had settled these mat ters after the manner already described he made war upon the Philistines and beat them and possessed himself of ah1 the ene mies cities from Gaza to Gath but the king of Assyria sent to him and threatened to overturn all his dominions unless he would pay him the tribute which his father paid him formerly but king Hezekiah was not concerned at his threatenings but depended on his piety towards God and upon Isaiah the pro phet by whom he inquired and accurately knew all future events And thus much shall suffice for the present concerning this king Hezekiah CHAP XIV flow Shalmaneser

that Hoshea the king of Israel had sent privately to So the king of Egypt desiring his assistance against him he was very angry and made an expedition against Sama ria in the seventh year of the reign of Hoshea but when he was not admitted into the city by the king  he besieged Samaria three years and took it by force in the ninth year of the reign of Hoshea and in the seventh year of Hezekiah king of Jerusalem and quite demolished the government of the Israelites and transplanted all the people into Media and Persia among whom he took king Hoshea alive and when he had removed these people out of this their land he transplanted other nations out of Cuthath a place so called for there is still a river of that name in Persia into Samaria and into the coun try of the Israelites So the ten tribes of the Israelites were re mQved out of Judea nine hundred and forty seven years after their forefathers were come out of the land of Egypt and pos  The siege of Samaria though nor given a particular account of either in our Hebrew or Greek Bibles or in Josephus was so very long no less than three years that it was no way improbable but that parents and particularly mothers might therein be reduced to eÂ t their own children as the law of Moses had threatened upon their disobedience Lev it xxvi 29 Deut xxviii 53â 57 and as was accom ptished in the other shorter sieges of both

eight hundred years after Joshua had been their leader and as I have already observed two hundred and forty years seven months and seven days af ter they had revolted from Rehoboam the grandson of David and had given the kingdom to Jeroboam And such a conclu sion overtook the Israelites when they had transgressed the laws Â nd would not hearken to the prophets who foretold that this calamity would come upon them if they would not leave off their evil doings What gave birth to these evil doings was that sedition which they raised against Rehoboam the grand son of David when they set up Jeroboam his servant to be their king who by sinning against God and bringing them to imitate his bad example made God to be their enemy while Jeroboam underwent that punishment which he justly deserved 2 And now the king of Assyria invaded all Syria and Pheni cia in a hostile manner The name of this king is also set down in the archives of Tyre for he made an expedition against Tyre in the reign of Eluleus and Menander attests to it who when he wrote his Chronology and translated the archives of Tyre in to the Greek language gives us the following history One whose name was Eluleus reigned thirty six years this king upon the revolt of the Citteans sailed to them and reduc ed them again to a submission Against these did the king of Assyria send an army and in a hostile manner overrun all Phenicia but soon made peace with them all and return ed back but Sidon and Ace and Palaetyrus revolted and many other cities there were which delivered themselves up to the king of Assyria Accordingly when the Tyrians would not submit to him the king returned and fell upon them again while the Phenicians had furnished him with threescore ships and eight hundred men to row them and when the Ty rians had come upon them in twelve ships and the enemies ships were dispersed they took five hundred men prisoners and the reputation of all the citizens of Tyre was thereby in creased but the king of Assyria returned and placed guards at their river and aqueducts who should hinder the Tyrians from drawing water This continued for five years and still  the Tyrians bore the siege and drank of the water they had out of the wells they dug And this is what is written in the Tyrian archives concerning Shalmaneser the king of Assyria 3 But now the Cutheans who removed into Samaria for

ty God to be angry and displeased at them for a plague seized upon them by which they were destroyed and when they found no cure for their miseries they learned by the oracle that they ought to worship Almighty God as the method for their deliv erance So they sent ambassadors to l he king of Assyria iand desired him to send them some of those priests of the Israelites whom he had taken captive And when he thereupon sent them and the people were by them taught the laws and the holy wor ship of God they worshipped him in a respectful manner and the plague ceased immediately and indeed they continue to make use of the very same customs to this very time and are called in the Hebrew tongue Cutheans but in the Greek tongue Samaritans And when they see the Jews in prosperity they pretend that they are changed and allied to them and call them kinsmen as though they were derived from Joseph and had by that means an original alliance with them but when they see them falling into a low condition they say they are no way re Jated to them and that the Jews have no right tp expect any kindness or marks of kindred from them but they declare that they are sojourners that come from other countries But of these we shall have a more seasonable opportunity to discourse hereafter Chap I ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 4J BOOKX CONTIIKING THE INTERVAL OF ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY TWO YEARS AND

and what befell him a little afterward 4 1 IT was now the fourteenth year of the government of Hezekiah king of the two tribes when the king of Assy ria whose name was Sennacherib made an expedition against him with a great army and took all the cities of the tribe of Judah and Benjamin by force and when he was ready to bring his army against Jerusalem Hezekiah sent ambassadors to him beforehand and promised to submit and pay what tribute he should appoint Hereupon Sennacherib when he heard of what offers the ambassadors made resolved not to proceed in the war but to accept of the proposals that were made him and if he might receive three hundred talents of silver andj thirty talents of gold he promised that he would depart in a Friendly manner and he gave security upon oath to the ambassadors that he would then do him no harm but go away as he came So Hezekiah submitted and emptied his treasures and sent the money as sup posing he should be freed from his enemy and from any farther distress about his kingdom Accordingly the Assyrian king took it and yet had no regard to what he had promised but while he himself went to the war against the Egyptians and Ethio pians he left his general Rabshakeh and two other command ers with great forces to destroy Jerusalem The names of the two other commanders were Tartan and Rabsaris 2 Now as soon as they were come before the walls they pitch ed their camp and sent messengers to Hezekiah and desired that 48 ANTIQUITIES OF THB JEWS Book X they might speak with him but he did not himself come out to them for fear but he sent three of his most intimate friends the name of one was Eliakim who was over the kingdom and Sheb na and Joah the recorder So these men came out and stood over against the commanders of the Assyrian army and when Rabshakeh saw them he bid them go and speak to Hezekiah in the manner following That  Sennacherib the  great king de sires to know of him on whom it is that he relies and depends in flying from his lord and will not hear him nor admit his army into the city Is it on account of the Egyptians and in hopes that his army would be beaten by them Whereupon he lets him know that if this be what he expects he is a tbol ish man and like one who leans on a broken reed while such a one will not only fall down but will have his hand pier ced and hurt by it That he ought to know he makes this expedition against him by the will of God who hath granted this favour to him that he shall overthrow the kingdom o Israel and that in the very same manner he shall destroy  those that are his subjects also When Rabshakeh had made this speech in the Hebrew tongue for he was skilful in that language Eliakim was afraid lest the multitude that heard him should be disturbed so he desired him to speak in the Sy rian tongue but the general understanding what he meant and perceiving the fear that he was in he made his answer with a greater and a louder voice but in the Hebrew tongue and said that  since they all heard what were the king s commands they would consult their own advantage in delivering up themselves to us for it is plain that both you and your king dissuade the people from submitting by vain hopes and so in duce them to resist but if you be courageous and think to drive our forces away I am ready to deliver to you two thousand of these horses that are with me for your use if you can set as many horsemen on their backs and show your strength but what you have not you cannot produce Why therefore do you delay to deliver up yourselves to a superior force who can take you without your consent although it will be safer for you to deliver yourselves up voluntarily while a forcible capture when you are beaten must appear more dan gerous and will bring farther calamities upon you 3 When the people as well as the ambassadors heard what the Assyrian commander said they related it to Hezekiah who thereupon put off his royal apparel and clothed himself with sack cloth and took the habit of a mourner and after the manner of This title of Great King both in our Bibles 2 Kings x iii 19 Isa xxxvi here in Joscphus is the very Spanheim takes notice on this place and here in Josephus is the very same that Herodotus gives tliis Sennacherib i Chap I ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 49 t bis country he fell upon his face and besought God and entreat ed him to assist them now they had no other hope of relief He also sent some of his friends and some of the priests to the pro phet Isaiah and desired that he would pray to God and offer sacrifices for their common deliverance and so put up supplica tions to him that he would have indignation at the expectations of their enemies and have mercy on his people And when the prophet had done accordingly an oracle came from God to him and encouraged the king and friends that were about him and foretold that their enemies should be beaten with out fighting and should go away in an ignominious manner and not with that insolence which they now show for that God would take care that they should be destroyed He also foretold that Sennacherib the king of Assyria should fail of his purpose against Egypt and that when he came home he should perish by the sword 4 About the same time also the king of Assyria wrote an epistle to Hezekiah in which he said he was a foolish man in supposing that he should escape from being his servant since he had already brought under many and great nations and he threatened that when he took him he would utterly destroy him unless be now opened the gates and willingly received his army into Jerusalem When he read this epistle he despised it on account of the trust that he had in God but he rolled up the epistle and laid it up within the temple And as he made his farther prayers to God for the city and for the preservation of all the people the prophet Isaiah said that  God had heard his prayer and that he should not be  besieged at this time by the king of Assyria that for the future he might be secure of not being at all disturbed by him and the people might go on peaceably and without fear with their husbandry and other affairs But after a little

at all disturbed by him and that afterward the people might go on peaceably and without fear with their husbandry and other affaire is more distinct in our other copies both of the Kings and of Isaiah and deserves very great consideration The words are these This shall be a sign unto thee ye shall eat this year such as groweth of itself and the second year that which springeth of the same and in the third year sow ye and reap and plant vine yards and eat the fruit thereof 2 Kings xix 20 Isa xxxvii 30 which seem to me plainly to design a sabbatic year a year of Jubilee next after it and the succeeding usual labours and fruits of them on the third and following years W AWFJO rFMKS OP THE JEWS Book X that he had raised over against the walls were of a great height and when he was ready to make an immediate assault upon them but heard that Tirhaka king of the Ethiopians was coming and bringing great forces to aid the Egyptians and was resolved to march through tfie desart and so to fall directly upon the Assy rians this king Sennacherib was disturbed at the news and as I said before left Pelusium and returned back without success Now concerning this Sennacherib Herodotus also says in the second book of his histories How this King came against the a Egyptian king who was the priest of Vulcan and that as he was besieging Pelusium he broke up the siege on the follow ing occasion this Egyptian priest prayed to God and God rt heard his prayer and sent a judgment upon the Arabian king But in this Herodotus was mistaken when he called this king Hot king of the Assyrians but of the Arabians for he saith that  a multitude of mice gnawed to pieces in one night both  the bows and the rest of the armour of the Assyrians and that 44 it was on that account that the king when he had no bows left drew off his army from Pelusium And Herodotus does indeed give us this history nay and Berosus who wrote of the affairs of Chaldea makes mention of this king Sennacherib and that he ruled over the Assyrians and that he made an expedi tion against all Asia and Egypt and  says thus 3 Now when Sennacherib was returning from his Egyp tian war to Jerusalem he found his army under Rabshakeh his general in danger by a plague for God had sent a pes tilential distemper upon his qrmy and on the very first night K of the siege a hundred fourscore and five thousand with their w captains and general s were destroyed So the king was in a great dread and in a terrible agony at this calamity and being in great fear for his whole army he fled with the rest of his forces to his own kingdom and to his city Nineveh And when he had abode there a little while he was treacherously assaulted and died by the hands of his elder sons f Adram  melech and Seraser and was slam in his own temple which was called Araske Now these sons of his were driven away on account of the murder of their father by the citizens and  went into Armenia while Assarachoddas took the kingdom of   That this terrible calamity of the slaughter of the 185 000 Assyrians is here de livered in the words of Berosus the Chaldean and that it was certainly and fre quently foretold by the Jewish prophets and that it was certainly and undeniably accomplished see Authentic Kec part II page 858 f We are here to take notice that these two sons of Sennacherib that ran away into Armenia became the heads of two famous families there the Arzcrunii and Genunii of which see the particular histories iu Moses Choreuensis p 60 Chap II ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 51 of Sennacherib And this proved to lie the conclusion of this Assyrian expedition against the people of Jerusalem CHAP II Hffw Hezekiah was sick and ready to die  and hem God bestow ed upon him fifteen years longer life and secured that promise by the going back of the shadow ten degrees j 1 JN ow king Hezekiah being thus delivered after a sur prising manner from the dread he was in offered thank offer ings to God with all his people because nothing else had de stroyed some of their enemies and made the rest so fearful 01 undergoing the same fate that they departed from Jerusalem by that divine assistance Yet while he was very zealous and diligent about the worship of God did he soon afterward fall into a severe  distemper insomuch that the physicians despaired of him and expected no good issue of his sickness as neither did his friends and besides the distemper itself there was a very melancholy circumstance that disordered the king which was the considera tion that he was childless and was going to die and leave his house and his government without a successor o his own body so he was troubled at the thoughts of this his condition and la mented himself and entreated of God that he would prolong his life for a little while till he had some children and not suffer him to depart this life before he was become a father Hereupon God had mercy upon him and accepted of his supplication be cause the trouble he was under at his supposed death was not be cause he was soon to leave the advantages he enjoyed in the king dom nor did he on that account pray that he might have a longer Jife afforded him but in order to have sons that might receive the government after him And God sent Isaiah the prophet and commanded him to inform Hezekiah that  within three days time he should get clear of his distemper and should sur vive it fifteen years and that he should have children also Now upon the prophet s saying this as God had commanded him he could hardly believe it both on account of the distemper  Josephus and all our copies place the siclmess of Hezekiah after the destruction of Sennacherib s army because it appear to have been after his first assault as he was going into Arabia and Egypt where he pushed his conquests as far as they would go  and in order to despatch his story altogether yet does no copy but this of Josephus say it was after that destruction but only that it happened in those days or about the time of Hezekiah s life Nor will the fifteen years prolongation of his life after his sickness allow that sickness to hate been later than the former part of the 15th year of his reign since chronology does not allow him in all above 29 years and a few months whereas the first assault of Sennacherib was on the 14th year of Hezekiah but the destruction of Sennacherib s army was not till the IStb year VOL II G 17 B2 JtNTIjJUITIBtf OF THB JEWS BOOK XÂ he was under which was very sore and by reason of the sur prising nature of what was told him so he desired that Isaiah would give him some sign of wonder that he might believe him in what he had said andbe sensible that he came from God for things that are beyond expectation and greater than our hopes are made credible by the actions of like nature And when Isaiah bad asked him WThat sign he desired to be exhibited he desired that he would make the shadow of the sun which he had already made to go down ten steps or degrees in his house to  return again to the same place and to make it as it was be fore And when the prophet prayed to God to exhibit this sign to the king he saw what he desired to see and was freed from his distemper and went up to the temple where he wor shipped God and made vows to him 2 At this time it was that the dominion of the Assyrians f waa overthrown by the Medes but of these things I shall treat else where But the king of Babylon whose name was Baladon sent ambassadors to Hezekiah with presents and desired he would be his ally and his friend So he received the ambassadors gladly and made them a feast and showed them his treasures and his armoury and the other wealth he was possessed of in precious stones and in gold and gave them presents to be carried to Ba ladon and sent them back to him Upon which the prophet Isaiah came to him and inquired of him Whence those am  bassadors came To which he replied That  they came  from Babylon from the king and that he had showed them  As to this regress of the shadow either upon tt sun dial or the steps of the royal palace built by Ahaz whether it were physically done by the real miracu lous revolution of the earth in its diurnal motion backward from east to west for a while and its return again to its old natural revolution from west to east or whe ther it were not apparent only and performed by an zerkil phosphorus which imi tated the sun s motion backward while a cloud hid the real sun cannot now be de termined Philosophers and astronomers will naturally incline to the latter hypothe sis However it must be noted that Josephus seemi to have understood it otherwise than we generally do that the shadow was accelerated at much at first forward as it was made to go backward afterward and so the day was neither longer nor shorter than usual which it must be confessed agrees best of all to astronomy whose eclip ses older than that time were observed at the times of the day as if this miracle bad never happened After all this wonderful signal was not it seems peculiar to Ju dea but either seen or at last heard of at Babylon also as appears by 2 Chron xxxii 31 where we learn that the Babylonian ambassadors were sent to Hezekiah among other things to im uira of the wonder that was done in the land f This expression of Josephus that the Medes upon this destruction of the As syrian army ova threw the Assyrian empire seems to be too strong for although they immediately cast off the Assyrian yoke and set up Deioces a king of their own jet it was sometime before the Medes and Babylonians overthrew Nineveh and some generations ere

thereby guess at the plenty he was in and be able to in  form the king of it But the prophet rejoined and said Know thou that after a little while these riches of thine shall be carried away to Babylon and thy posterity shall be made eunuchs there and lose their manhood and be servants to the king of Babylon for that God foretold such things would come to pass Upon which words Hezckiah was troubled and said That he was himself unwilling that his  nation should fall into such calamities yet since it is not pos sible to alter what God had determined he prayed that there  might be peace while he lived Berosus also makes men don of this Baladon king of Babylon Now sis to this prophet Isaiah he was by the confession of all a divine and wonderful man in speaking truth and out of the assurance that he had never written what was false he wrote down all his pro phecies and left them behind him in books that their accom plishment might be judged of from the events by posterity nor did this prophet do so alone but the others which were twelve in number did the same And whatsoever is done among us whether it be good or whether it be bad comes to pass accord ing to their prophecies but of every one of those we shall speak hereafter   CHAP III How Manasseh reigned after Hezekiah and how when he was in captivity he returned to God and was restored to his king dom and left it to his son Amon  1 WHEN king Hezekiah had survived the interval ot tune already mentioned and had dwelt all that time in peace he died having completed fifty four years of his life and reigned twenty nine but when his son Manasseh whose mother s name was Hephzibah of Jerusalem had taken the kingdom he departed from the conduct of his father and fell into a course of life quite contrary thereto and showed himself in his manners most wickeVl in all respects and omitted no sort of impiety but imitated those transgressions of the Israelites by the commission of which against God they had been destroyed for he was so hardy as to defile the temple of God and the city and the whole country for by setting out from a contempt of God he barbarously slew all the righteous men who were among the Hebrews nor would he spare the prophets for he every day slew some of them till Jerusalem was overthrown with blood So God was angry at these proceedings and sent prophets to 34 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book X the king and to the multitude by whom he threatened the very same calamities to them which their brethren the Israel ites upon the like affronts offered to God were now under But these men would not believe their words by which beliet they might have reaped the advantage of escaping all those mi series yet did they in earnest learn that what the prophets had told them was true 2 And when they persevered in the same course of life God raised up war against them from the king of Babylon and Chal dea who sent an army against Judea and laid waste the coun try and caught king Manasseh by treachery and ordered hin to be brought to him and had him under his power to inflic what punishment he pleased upon him But then it was that Manasseh perceived what a miserable condition he was in and esteeming himself the cause of all he besought God to render his enemy humane and merciful to him Accordingly God heard his prayer and granted him what he prayed for So Ma nasseh was released by the king of Babylon and escaped the dan ger he was in And when he was come to Jerusalem he en deavoured if it were possible to cast out of his memory those his former sins against God of which he now repented and to apply himself to a very religious life He sanctified the temple and purged the city and for the remainder of his days he was intent on nothing but to return his thanks to God for his de liverance and to preserve him propitious to him all his lifelong He also instructed the multitude to do the same as having very nearly experienced what a calamity he was fallen into by a con trary conduct He also rebuilt the altar and offered the legal sacrifices as Moses commanded And when he had re establish ed what concerned the divine worship as it ought to be he took care of the security of Jerusalem he did not only repair the old walls with great diligence but added another wall to the former He also built very lofty towers and the garrisoned places before the city he strengthened not only in other respects but with provisions of all sorts that they wanted And indeed when he had changed his former course he so led his life foÂ the time to come that from the time of his return to piety to wards God he was deemed a happy man and a pattern foi mitation when therefore he had lived sixty seven years he departed this life having reigned fifty five years and was buried in his own garden and the kingdom came to his son Amon whose mother s name was Meshumeleth of the city of Jobath Chap IV AN iiguiTiES or THE JEWS 55 CHAP IV Hffx Amon reigned instead of Manassek and after Amon reign ed Josiah he was both righteous and religious As also con cerning Hulddh the prophetess Â 1 1 HIS Amon imitated those works of his father which he insolently did when he was young so he had a conspiracy made against him by his own servants and was slain in his own house when he had lived twenty four years and of them had reigned two But the multitude punished those that slew Amon and buried him with his father and gave the kingdom to his son Josiah who was eight years old His mother was of the city of Boscath and her name was Jedidah He was of a most excellent disposition and naturally virtuous and fol lowed the actions of king David as a pattern and rule to him in the whole conduct of his life And when he was twelve years old he gave demonstrations of his religious and righteous behaviour for he brought the people to a sober way of living and exhorted them to leave off the opinion they had of their idols because they were not gods but to worship their own God And by reflecting on the actions of his progenitors he prudently corrected what they did wrong like a very elderly man and like one abundantly able to understand what was fit to be done and when he found they had well done he observed all the country over and imitated the same And thus he acted in following the wisdom and sagacity of his own nature and in following the laws it was that he succeeded so well in the order of his government and in piety with regard to the divine wor ship And this happened because the transgressions of the for ner kings were seen no more but quite vanished away for the dng went about the city and the whole country and cut down the groves which were devoted to strange gods and overthrew their altars and if there were any gifts dedicated to them by his forefathers he made them ignominious and plucked them down and by this means he brought the people back from their opinion about them to the worship of God He also offered his accustomed sacrifices and burnt offerings upon the altar More over he ordained certain judges and overseers that they might order the matters to them severally belonging and have regard to justice above all things and distribute it with the same con cern they would have about their own soul He also sent over all the country and desired such as pleased to bring gold and silver for the repairs of the temple according to every one s in clinations and abilities And when the money was brought in 56 ANTIQUITIES OF THX JEWS Book X he made one Maaseiah the governor of the city and Shaphan the scribe and Joash the recorder and Eliakim the high priest curators of the temple and of the charges contributed thereto who made no delay nor put off the work at all but prepar ed architects and whatsoever was proper for those repairs and set closely about the work So the temple was repaired by this means and became a public demonstration of the king s piety 2 But when he was now in the eighteenth year of his reign he sent to Eliakim the high priest and gave order that out of what money was overplus he should cast cups and dishes and vials for ministration in the temple and besides that they should bring all the gold and silver which was among the trea sures and expend that also in making cups and the like vessels But as tie high priest was bringing out the gold he light upon the holy books of Moses that were laid up hi the temple and when he had brought them out he gave them to Shaphan the scribe who when he had read them came to the king and in formed him that all was finished which he had ordered to be done He also read over the books to him who when he had heard them read rent his garment and called for Eliakim the high priest and for Shaphan the scribe and for certain other of his most particular friends and sent diem to Huldah the pro phetess the wife of Shall um which Shallum was a man of dig nity and of an eminent family and bid them go to her and say That he desired  she would appease God and endeavour to render him propitious to them for that there was cause to fear lest upon the transgression of the laws of Moses by their  forefathers they should be in peril of going into captivity and of being cast out of their own country lest they should be in want of all things and so end their days miserably When the prophetess had heard this from the messengers that were sent to her by the king she bid them go back to the king and say that  God had already given sentence against them to destroy the people and cast them out of their country and deprive them of all the happiness they enjoyed which sen tence none could set aside by any prayers of theirs since it was passed on account of the transgressions of the laws and ol their not having repented in so long a time while the pro  phets had exhorted them to amend and had foretold the pu nishment that would ensue on their impious practices which threatening God would certainly execute upon them that  they might be persuaded that he is God and had not deceived them in any respect as to what he had denounced by his pro phets that yet because Josiah was a righteous man he would at present delay those calamities but that after his Chap IV ANTI2UITIS8 OF THE JEWS Â 7 death lie would send on the multitude what miseries he had determined for them 3 So these messengers upon this prophecy of the woman came and told it to the king whereupon he sent to the people every where and ordered that the priests and the Levites should come together to Jerusalem and commanded that those of every age should be present also And when they had gathered together he first read to them the holy books after which he stood upon a pulpit in the midst of the multitude and obliged them to make a covenant with an oath that they would worship God and keep the laws of Moses Accordingly they gave their as sent willingly and undertook to do what the king had recom mended to them So they immediately offered sacrifices and that after an acceptable manner and besought God to be gra cious and merciful to them He also enjoined the high priest that if there remained in the temple any vessel that was dedicated to idols or to foreign gods they should cast it out So when a great number of such vessels were got together he burnt them and scattered their ashes abroad and slew the priests of the idols that were not of the family of Aaron 4 And when he had done thus in Jerusalem he came into the country and utterly destroyed what buildings had been made therein by king Jeroboam in honour of strange gods and he burnt the bones of the false prophets upon that altar which Je roboam first built And as the prophet Jadon who came to Jeroboam when he was offering sacrifice and when all the peo ple heard him foretold what would come to pass viz That a certain man of the house of David Josiah by name should do what is here mentioned And it happened that those pre dictions took effect after three hundred and sixty one years 5 After these things Josiah went also to such other Israelites as had escaped captivity and slavery under the Assyrians and persuaded them to desist from their impious practices and to leave off the honours they paid to strange gods but to worship rightly their own Almighty God and adhere to him He also searched the houses and the villages and the cities out of a sus picion that somebody might have one idol or other in private nay indeed he took away the  chariots of the sun that were  It is hard to reconcile the account in the second book of Kings ch xxilf II with this account of Jo scphus and to translate this passage truly in Josephus whose copies are supposed to be here imperfect However the general sense of both seems to be this that there were certain chariots with their horses dedicated to the idol of In sun or to Moloch  which idol must be carried about in procession and worship ped by the people which chariots were now taken away as Josephus says or Â s tbt book of the Kings says burnt with fire by Joiiak 55 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book X set up in his royal palace which his predecessors had framed and what thing soever there was besides which they worshipped as a god And when he had thus purged all the country he call ed the people to Jerusalem and there celebrated the feast of unleavened bread and that called the Passover He also gave the people for Paschal sacrifices young kids of the goats and lambs thirty thousand and three hundred oxen for burnt of ferings The principal of the priests also gave to the priests against the passover two thousand and six hundred lambs the principal of the Levites also gave to the Levites five thousand Jambs and five hundred oxen by which means there was great plenty of sacrifices and they offered those sacrifices according to the laws of Moses while every priest explained the matter and ministered to the multitude And indeed there had been no other festival thus celebrated by the Hebrews from the times of Samuel the prophet and the plenty of sacrifices now was the occasion that all things were performed according to the laws and according to the custom of their forefathers So when Jo siah had after this lived in peace nay in riches and reputation also among all men he ended his life in the manner following CHAP V How Josiah fought with Neco king of Egypf and was twund ed and died in a little afterward As also how Neco carried Jehoahaz who had been made king into Egypt and delivered the kingdom to Jehoiakim And lastly concerning Jeremiah and Ezekiel Â 1 JXow Neco king of Egypt raised an army ami marched to the river Euphrates in order to fight with the Medes and Babylonians who had  overthrown the dominion of the Assyrians for he had a desire to reign over Asia Now when he was come to the city Mendes which belonged to the kingdom of Josiah he brought an army to hinder him from pass ing through his own country in his expedition against the Medes Now Neco sent a herald to Josiah and told him That he did not make this expedition against him but was making haste to Euphrates and desired that he would not provoke him to fight against him because he obstructed his march to the place whither he had resolved to go But Jo  This is a remarkable passage of chronology in Josephus that about the latter end of the reign of Josiah the Medes and Babylonians overthrew the empire of the Assyrians or in the words of Tobit s continuator that before Tobias died lie heard of the destruction of Nineveh which was taken by Nebuchodonosor the Babylonian and Assuerus die Mede Tob ziv 15 â See Dean Prideaux Con nection at tht year 612 p y ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 59 siah did not admit of this advice of Neco s but put himself into tt posture to hinder him from this intended march 1 suppose it was fate that pushed him on to this conduct that it might take an occasion against him  for as he was setting his  army in ar ray and rode about in his chariot from one wing of his army to another one of the Egyptians shot an arrow at him and put an end to his eagerness of fighting for being sorely wounded he commanded a retreat to be sounded for his army and returned to Jerusalem and died of that wound and was magnificently buried in the sepulchre of his fathers when he had lived thirty nine years and of them had reigned thirty one But all the people mourned greatly for him lamenting and grieving on his account many days and Jeremiah the prophet f composed an elegy to lament him which is extant till this time also More over this prophet denounced beforehand the sad calamities that were coming upon the city He also left behind him in writing a description of that destruction of our nation which has lately happened in our days and the taking of Babylon nor was he the only prophet who delivered such predictions beforehand to the multitude but so did Ezekiel tdso who was the first person that wrote and left behind him in writing two books concern ing these events Now these two prophets were priests by birth but of them Jeremiah dwelt in Jerusalem from the thirteenth year of the reign of Josiah until the city and temple were utter ly destroyed However as to what befell this prophet we will relate it in its proper place 2 Upon the death of Josiah which we have already mention ed his son Jehoahaz by name took the kingdom  being about twenty three years old He reigned in Jerusalem and his mo ther was Hamutal of the city Libnah He was an impious man and impure in his course of life but as the king of Egypt re turned from the battle he sent for Jehoahaz to come to him to the city called J Hamath which belongs to Syriaj and when ha was come he put him in bonds and delivered the kingdom to a brother of his by the father s side whose name was Eliakim and  This battle is justly esteemed the very same that Herodotus B II Â 156 men tions when hi says that Neco joined battle with the Syrians or Jews at Mag dolum Megiddo nnd beat them as Dr Hudson here observes f Whether Josephus from 2 Chrou XXXT 25 here means the book of the La mentations of Jeremiah still extant which chiefly belongs to the destruction of Je rusalem under Nebuchadnezzar or to any other like melancholy poem now lost but extant in the days of Josephus belonging peculiarly to Josiah cannot now be deter mined  This ancient city Hamath which is joined with Arpad or Aradus and with Oa matcus 2 Kings xviii 18 Isa xxxvi 19 Jer xlix 23 cities of Syria and Fhenicia near the borders of Judea was also itself evidently near the same borders though long age utterly destroyed VOL II Ii 17 60 JtNTlQUrriES OF TKK JEWS Book X changed his name to Jehoiakim and laid a tribute upon the land of a hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold and the sum of money Jehoiakim paid by way of tribute but Neco carried away Jehoahaz into Egypt where he died when he had reigned three months and ten days Now Jehoiakim s mother was cal led Zebudah of the city Rumah He was of a wicked dispo sition and ready to do mischief nor was he either religious towards God or good natured towards men CHAP VI How Nebuchadnezzar when he had conquered the king of Egypt made an expedition against the Jews and slew Jehoiakim and made Jehoiachin his son king Â I Now in the fourth year of the reign of Jehoiakim one whose name was Nebuchadnezzar took the government over the Babylonians who at the same time went up with a great army to the city Carchemish which was at Euphrates upon a resolution he had taken to fight with Neco king of Egypt un der whom all Syria then was And when Neco understood the intention of the king of Babylon and that this expedition was made against him he did not despise his attempt but made haste with a great band of men to Euphrates to defend himself from Nebuchadnezzar and when they had joined battle he was beat en and lost many ten thousands of his soldiers in the battle So the king of Babylon passed over Euphrates and took all Sy ria as far as Pelusium excepting Judea But when Nebuchad nezzar had already reigned four years which was the eighth of Jehoiakim s government over the Hebrews the king of Babylon made an expedition with mighty forces against the Jews and re quired tribute of Jehoiakim and threatened on his refusal to make war against him He was affrighted at his threatening and bought Iris peace with money and brought the tribute he was ordered to bring for three years 2 But on the third year upon hearing that the king of the Babylonians made an expedition against the Egyptians he did not pay his tribute yet was he disappointed of his hope for the Egyptians durst not fight at this time And indeed the prophet Jeremiah foretold every day how vainly they relied on their hopes from Egypt and how the city would be overthrown bv the king of Babylon and Jehoiakim the king would be subdued by him But what he thus spake proved to be of no advantao e to them because there were none that should escape for both the multitude and the rulers when they heard him had no concern about what they heard but being displeased at what was said Chap VI ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 61 as if the prophet were a diviner against the king they accused Jeremiah and bringing him before the court they required that a sentence and a punishment might be given against him Now all the rest gave their votes for his condemnation but the elders refused who prudently sent away the prophet from the court of the prison and persuaded the rest to do Jeremiah no harm for they said that he was not the only person who foretold what would come to the city but that Micath signified the same before him as well as many others none of which suffered any thing of the kings that then reigned but were honoured as the prophets of God So they mollified the multitude with these words and delivered Jeremiah from the punishment to which he was condemned Now when this prophet had written all his prophecies and the people were fasting and assembled at the temple on the ninth month of the fifth year of Jehoiakim he read the book he had composed of his predictions of what was to befall the city and the temple and the multitude And when the rulers heard of it they took the book from him and bid him and Baruch the scribe to go their ways lest they should be discovered by one or other but they carried the book and gave it to the king so he gave order in the presence of his friends that his scribe should take it and read it When the king heard what it contained he was angry and tore it and cast it into the fire where it was consumed He also commanded that they should seek for Jeremiah and Baruch the scribe and bring them to him that they might be punished However they escaped his anger 3 Now a little time afterward the king of Babylon made an expedition against Jehoiakim whom he received into the city and this out of fear of the foregoing predictions of this prophet as supposing that he should suffer nothing that was terri ble because he neither shut the gates nor fought against him yet when he was come into the city he did not observe the covenants he had made but he slew such as were in the flower of their age and such as were of the greatest dignity together with their king Jehoiakim whom he commanded to be thrown before the walls without any burial and made his son Jehoiachin king of the country and of the city he also took the principal persons in dignity for captives three thousand in number and led them away to Babylon among whom was the prophet Ezekiel who was then but young And this was the end of king Jehoiakim when he had lived thirty six years and of them reigned eleven  but Jehoiachin succeeded him in the kingdom whose mother s name was Nehushta she was a citizen of Jerusalem He reigned three months and ten days 62 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book X  CHAP VII That the king of Babylon repented of making Jehoiachin king and took him twaaij to Babylon and delivered the kingdom to Zedekiah This king tsioidd not believe what was predicted by Jeremiah and Ezekiel but joined himself to the Egyptians  who when they came into Judea were vanquished by the king of Babylon as also what befell Jeremiah  1 BUT a terror seized on the king of Babylon who had given the kingdom to Jehoinchin and that immediately he was afraid that he should bear him a grudge because of his killing his father and thereupon should make the country revolt from him wherefore he sent an army and besieged Jehoiachin in Jerusalem but because he was of a gentle and just disposition he did not desire to see the city endangered on his account but he took his mother and kindred and delivered them to the commanders sent by the king of Babylon and accepted of their oaths that neither should they suffer any harm nor the city which agreement they did not observe for a single year for the king of Babylon did not keep it but gave orders to his generals to take all that were in the city captives both the youth and the handicraftsmen and bring them bound to him their number was ten thousand eight hundred and thirty two as also Jehoiachin and his mother and friends And when these were brought to him he kept them in custody and appointed Jehoiachin s uncle Zedekiah to be king and made him take an oath that he would certainly keep the kingdom for him and make no innovation nor have any league of friendship with the Egyptians 2 Now Zedekiah was twenty and one years old when he took the government and had the same mother with his brother Je hoiakim but was a despiser of justice and of his duty for truly those of the same age with him were wicked about him and the whole multitude did what unjust and insolent things they pleased for which reason the prophet Jeremiah came often to him and protested to him and insisted That  he must leave off his im  pieties and transgressions and take care of what was right  and neither give ear to the rulers among whom were wicked men nor give credit to their false prophets who deluded  them as if the king of Babylon would makenomorewar against them and as if the Egyptians would make war against him  and conquer him since what they said was not true and the events would not prove such as they expected Now as to Zedekiah himself while he heard the prophet speak he believed him and agreed to every thing as true and supposed it was for his Chap VII ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 63 advantage but then his friends perverted him arid dissuaded him from vrhat the prophet advised and obliged him to do what they pleased Ezekiel also foretold in Babylon what calamities were coming upon the people which when he heard he sent accounts of them into Jerusalem But Zedekiah did not believe their pro phecies for the reasons following It happened that the two pro phets agreed with one another in what they said as in all other things that the city should be taken and Zedekiah himself should be taken captive but Ezekiel disagreed with him and said that Zedekiah should not see Babylon while Jeremiah said to him That  the king of Babylon should carry him away thither in bonds And because they did not both say the same thing as to this circumstance he disbelieved what they both appeared to agree in and condemned them as not speaking truth therein although all the things foretold him did come to pass according to their prophecies as we shall show upon a fitter opportunity 3 Now when Zedekiah preserved the league of mutual as sistance he had made with the Babylonians for eight years he brake it and revolted to the Egyptians in hopes by their as sistance of overcoming the Babylonians When the king of Babylon knew this he made war against him he laid his country waste and took his fortified towns and came to the city Jerusalem itself to besiege it But when the king of Egypt heard what circumstances Zedekiah his ally was in He took a great army with him and came into Judea as if he would raise the siege upon which the king of Babylon departed from Jeru salem and met the Egyptians and joined battle with them and beat them and when he had put them to flight he pursued them and drove them out of all Syria Now as soon as the king of Babylon was departed from Jerusalem the false prophets deceived Zedekiah and said That  the king of Babylon would not any more make war against him or his people nor remove them out of their own country into Babylon and that those then in captivity would return with all those vessels of the temple of which the king of Babylon had despoiled that tem pie But Jeremiah came among them and prophesied what contradicted those predictions and what proved to be true That they did ill and deluded the king that the Egyptians would be of no advantage to them but that the king of Babylon would renew the war against Jerusalem and besiege it again and would destroy the people by faminer and carry away those that remained into captivity and would take away what they had as spoils and would carry off those riches that were in the temple nay that besides this he would burn it and ut terly overthrow the city and that they should serve him and his posterity seventy years that then the Persians and the 6 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWB Book X Medes should put an end to their servitude and overthrow  the Babylonians and that we shall be dismissed and return  to this land and  rebuild the temple and restore Jerusalem When Jeremiah said this the greater part believed him but the rulers and those that were wicked despised him as one disor dered in his senses Now he had resolved to go elsewhere to his own country which was called Anathoth and was twenty furlongs distant from Jerusalem and as he was going one of the rulers met him and seized upon him and accused him falsely as though he were going as a deserter to the Babylonians but Je remiah said that he accused him falsely and added that he was only going to his own country but the other would not believe him but seized upon him and led him away to the rulers and laid an accusation against him under whom he endured all sorts of torments and tortures and was reserved to be punished  and this was the condition he was in for some time while he suf fered what I have already described unjustly 4 Now in the ninth year of the reign of Zedekiah on the tenth day of the tenth month the king of Babylon made a se cond expedition against Jerusalem and lay before it eighteen months and besieged it with the utmost application There came upon them also two of the greatest calamities at the same time that Jerusalem was besieged a famine and pestilential distem per and made great havock of them And though the prophet Jeremiah was in prison he did not rest but cried out and pro claimed aloud and exhorted the multitude to open their gates and admit the king of Babylon for that if they did so they should be preserved and their whole families but if they did not so they should be destroyed and he foretold that if any one stayed in the city he should certainly perish by one of these ways either be consumed by the famine or slain by the enemy s sword but that if he would fly to the enemy he should escape death Yet did not these rulers who heard believe him even when they were in the midst of their sore calamities but they came to the king and in their anger informed him what Jeremiah said and accused him and complained of the prophet as of a madman and one that disheartened their minds and by the denunciation of miseries weakened the alacrity of the multitude who were otherwise ready to expose themselves to dangers for him and for their country while he in a way of threatening warned them to fly to the enemy and told them that the city should certainly be taken and be utterly destroyed  Josephus says here that Jeremiah prophesied not only of the return of the Jews from the Babylonian captivity and this under the Persians and Medes as in our other copies but of their rebuilding the temple and even the city Jerusalem which do not apoear in our copies under his name we the note on Anti j B XI chap I ect 3 Chap VII ANTIgUITIES OF THE JEW S 6 5 But for the king himself he was not at all irritated against Jeremiah such was his gentle and righteous disposition  yet that he might not be engaged in a quarrel with those rulers at such a time by opposing what they intended he let them do with the prophet whatsoever they would Whereupon when the king had granted them such a permission they presently came into the prison and took him and let him down with a cord into a pit full of mire that he might be suffocated and die of himself So he stood up to the neck in the mire which was all about him and so continued but there was of the king s ser vants who was in esteem with him an Ethiopian by descent who told the king what a state the prophet was in and said that his friends and his rulers had done evil in putting the prophet into the mire and by that means contriving against him that he should suffer a death more bitter than that by his bonds only When the king heard this he repented of his having delivered up the prophet to the rulers and bid the Ethiopian take thirty men of the king s guards and cords with them and whatsoever else they understood to be necessary for the prophet s preserva tion and draw him up immediately So the Ethiopian took the men he was ordered to take and drew up the prophet out of the mire and left him at liberty in the prison 6 But when the king had sent to call him privately and in quired what he could say to him from God which might be suit able to his present circumstances and desired him to inform him of it Jeremiah replied that he had somewhat to say but he said withal he  should not be believed nor if he admonished them should be hearkened to for said he thy friends have determined to destroy me as though I had been guilty of some wickedness and where are now those men who deceiv ed us and said that the king of Babylon would not come and fight against us any more but I am afraid now to speak the truth lest thou shouldst condemn me to die And when the king had assured him upon oath that he would neither himself put him to death nor deliver him up to the rulers he became bold upon that assurance that was given him and gave him this ad vicfe that  he should deliver the city up to the Babylonians and he said that it was God that prophesied this by him that he must do so if he would be preserved and escape out of the dan ger he was in and that then neither should the city fall to the ground nor should the temple be burned but that if he diso beyed he would be the cause of these miseries coming upon the citizens and of the calamity that would befall his whole house When the king heard this he said that he would willingly do what he persuaded him to and what he declared would be to  his advantage but that he was afraid of those of his own coun 66 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book X try that had fallen away to the Babylonians lest he should be accused by them to the king of Babylon and be punished But the prophet encouraged him and said  He had no cause to fear such punishment for that he should not have the expe rience of any misfortune if he would deliver all up to the Babylonians neither himself nor his children nor his wives and that the temple should then continue unhurt So when Jeremiah had said this the king let him go and charged him To betray what they had resolved on to none of the citizens nor to tell any of these matters to any of the rulers if they should have learned that he had been sent for and should in quire of him what it was that he was sent for and what he had said to him but to pretend to them that he besought him that he might not be kept in bonds and in prison And indeed he said so to them for they came to the prophet and asked him what advice it was that he came to give the king relating to them and thus I have finished what concerns this matter CHAP VIII How the king of Babylon took Jerusalem and burnt the temple and removed the people of Jerusalem and Zedekiah to Baby lon As also who they were that had succeeded in the high priesthood under the kings Â 1 Now the king of Babylon was very intent and earnest upon the siege of Jerusalem and he erected towers upon great  banks of earth and from them repelled those that stood upon the walls he also made a great number of such banks round about the whole city whose height was equal to those walls However those that were within bore the siege with courage and alacrity for they were not discouraged either by the famine or by the pestilential distemper but were of cheerful minds in the pro secution of the war although those miseries within oppressed them also and they did not suffer themselves to be te rrified either by the contrivances of the enemy or by their engines of war but contrived still different engines to oppose all the other withal till indeed there seemed to be an entire struggle between the Babylonians and the people of Jerusalem which had the greater sagacity and skill the former party supposing they should be thereby too hard for the other for the destruc tion of the city the latter placing their hopes of deliver ance in nothing else but in persevering in such inventions in opposition to the other as might demonstrate the enemies engines were useless to them And this siege they endured for eighteen months until they were destroyed by the famine Chap VIII ANTIQUITIES OF THJ JEWS Jb and by the darts which the enemy threw at them from the towers  2 Now the city was taken in the ninth day of the fourth month in the eleventh year of the reign of Zedekiah They were indeed only generals of the king of Babylon to whom Ne buchadnezzar committed the care of the siege for he abode him  self in the city of Riblah The names of these generals who rav  aged andsubdued Jerusalem if any one desire to know them were these Nergal Sharezer Samgar Nebo Rabsaris SaÂ rsechim and Rabmag And when the city was taken about midnight and the enemies generals were entered into the temple and when Ze dekiah was sensible of it he took his wives and his children and his captains and his friends and with them fled out of the city through the fortified ditch and through the desert and when certain of the deserters had informed the Babylonians of this at break of day they made haste to pursue after Zedekiah and over took him not far from Jericho and encompassed him about but for those friends and captains of Zedekiah who had fled out of the city with him when they saw their enemies near them they left him and dispersed themselves some one way and some ano ther and every one resolved to save himself so the enemy took Zedekiah alive when he was deserted by all but a few with his children and his wives and brought him to the king When he was come Nebuchadnezzar began to call him a wicked wretch and a covenant breaker and one that had forgotten his former words when he promised to keep the country for him He also reproached him for his ingratitude that when he had re ceived the kingdom from him who had taken it from Jehoia chin and given it him he had made use of the power he gave him against him that gave it but said he God is great who hated that conduct of thine and hath brought thee under us And when he had used these words to Zedekiah he commanded his sons and his friends to be slain while Zedekiah and the rest of the captains looked on after which he put out the eyes o Zedekiah  and bound him and carried him to Babylon And these things happened to him as Jeremiah and Ezekiel had foretold to him that he should be caught and brought before the king of Babylon and should speak to him face to face and should see his eyes with his own eyes and thus far did Jeremiah pro  This observation of Josephus about the seeming disagreement of Jeremiah chap wii 4 and xxxiv 3 and Ezek xii 13 but real agreement at last concerning the fate of Zedekiah is very true and very remarkable See chap vii sect 2 Nor is it at all unlikely that the courtiers and false prophets might make use of this ecming contradiction to dissuade Zedekiah from believing either of those prophet as Josephus here intimates lie was dissuaded thereby VOL II I If 0t ANTIQUITIES OF THK JEWS Book X phecy but he was also made blind and brought to Babylon but did not see it according to the prediction of Ezekiel 3 We have said thus much because it was sufficient to show the nature of God to such as are ignorant of it that it is various and acts many different ways ami that aU events happen after a regular manner in their proper season and that foretells what must come to pass It is also sufficient to show the ignorance and incredulity of men whereby they are not permitted to fore see any thing that is future and are without any guard ex posed to calamities so that it is impossible for them to avoid the experience of those calamities 4 And after this manner have the kings of David s race ended their lives being in number twenty one until the last king who altogether reigned five hundred and fourteen years and six months and ten days of whom Saul who was their first king retained the government twenty years though he was not of the same tribe with the rest 5 And now it was that the king of Babylon sent Nebuzara dan the general of his army to Jerusalem to pillage the temple who had it also in command to burn it and the royal palace and to lay the city even with the ground and to transplant the peo ple into Babylon Accordingly he came to Jerusalem in the eleventh year of king Zedekiah and pillaged the temple and car ried out the vessels of God both gold and silver and particular ly that large laver which Solomon dedicated as also the pillars oÂ brass and their chapiters with the golden tables and the candle sticks and when he had carried these off he set fire to the tem ple in the fifth month the first day of the month on the eleventh year of the reign of Zedekiah and in the eighteenth year of Ne buchadnezzar he also burnt the palace and overthrew the city Now the temple was burnt four hundred and seventy years six months and ten days after it was built It was then one thousand and sixty two years six months and ten days from the departure out of Egypt and from the deluge to the destruction of the temple the whole interval was one thousand nine hundred fifty seven years six months and ten days but from the generation of Adam until this befell the temple there were three thousand five hundred and thirteen years six months and ten days so great was the number of years hereto belonging And what actions were done during these years we have parti cularly related But the general of tfie Babylonian king now over threw the city to the very foundations and removed all the peo ple and took for prisoners the liigh priest Seraiah and Zepha niah the priest that was next to him and the rulers that guarded the temple who were three in number and the eunuch who was ovw the armed men and seven friends of Zedekiah and his Chap IX ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 69 acribe and sixty other rulers all which together with the ves sels which they had pillaged he carried to the king of Babylon to Riblah a city of Syria So the king commanded the heads of the high priest and of the rulers to be cut ofl there but he himself led all the captives and Zedekiah to Babylon He al so led Josedek the high priest away bound He was the son of Seraiah the high priest whom the king of Babylon had slain in Riblah a city of Syria as we have just now related  6 And now because we have enumerated the succession of the kings and who they were and how long they reigned I think it necessary to set down the names of the high priests and who they were that succeeded one another in the high priesthood un der the kings The first high priest then at the temple which Solomon built was Zadoc after him his son Achimas received that dignity after Achimas was Azarias his son was Joram and Joram s son was Isus after him was Axioramus his son was Phideas and Phideas son was Sudeas and Sudeas son was Juelus and Juelus son was Jotham and Jotham s son was Urias and Urias son was Nerias and Nerias son was Odeas and his son was Sallumus and Sallumus son was Elcias and his son  was Azarias and his son was Sareas and his son was Josadoc who was carried captive to Babylon All these received the high priesthood by succession the sons from their father 7 When the king was come to Babylon he kept Zedekiah in prison until he died and buried him magnificently and de dicated the vessels he had pillaged out of the temple of Jerusa lem to his own gods and planted the people in the country of Babylon but freed the high priest from his bonds CHAP IX How Nebuzaradan set Gedaliah over the Jews

prophet out of prison and Would have persuaded him to go along with him to Babylon for that he had been enjoined by the king to supply him with what soever he wanted  and if he did not like to do so he desired him to inform him where he resolved to dwell that he might sig nify the same to the king but the prophet had no mind to follow him nor to dwell any where else but would gladly live In the ruins of his country and in the miserable remains of it When the general understood what his purpose was he en joined Gedaliah whom he left behind to take all possible care of him and to supply him

set at liberty his disciple  Baruch the son of Neraiah one of a Very eminent family and exceeding skilful in the language of his country 2 When Nabuzaradan had done thus he made haste to Ba bylon But as to those that fled away during the siege of Jeru salem and had been scattered over the country when they heard that the Babylonians were gone away and had left a remnant in the land of Jerusalem and those such as were to cultivate the same they came together from all parts to Gedaliah to Mispah Now the rulers that were over them were Johanan the son of Kareah and Jazeniah andSeraiah and others beside them Now there was of the royal family one Ishmael a wicked man and very crafty who during the siege of Jerusalem fled to Baalis the king of the Ammonites and abode with him during that time And Gedaliah persuaded them now they were there to stay with him and to have no fear of the Babylonians for that if they would cultivate the country they should suffer no harm This he assured them of by oath and said that they should have him for their patron and that if any disturbance should arise they should find him ready to defend them He also advis ed them to dwell in any city as everyone of them pleased and that they would send men along with his own servants and re build their houses upon the old foundations and dwell there and he admonished them beforehand that they should

to them he dismissed them that every one might dwell in what place of the country he pleased 3 Now when this report was spread abroad as far as the na tions that bordered on Judea that Gedaliah kindly entertained those that came to him after they had fled away upon this on ly condition that they should pay tribute to the king of Baby lon they also came readily to Gedaliah and inhabited the coun try And when Johanan and the rulers that were with him observed the country and the humanity of Gedaliah they were exceedingly in love with him and told him that Baalis the king of the Ammonites had sent Ishmael to kill him by treach ery and secretly that he might have the dominion over the Is  raelites as being of the royal family and they said that he might deliver himself from this treacherous design if he would give them leave to slay Ishmael and nobody should know it for they told him they were afraid that when he was killed by the other the entire ruin of the remaining strength of the Israelites would ensue But he professed That  he did not believe what they said when they told him of such a treacherous design in a man that had been well treated by him because it was not probable that one who under such a want of all things had  failed of nothing that was necessary for him should be found so wicked and ungrateful towards his benefactor that when  it would be an instance of wickedness in him not to save him had he been treacherously assaulted by others to endeavour and that earnestly to kill him with his own hand That how  ever if he ought to suppose this information to be true it was better for himself to be slain by the other than to de stray a man who fled to him for refuge and entrusted his own  safety to him and committed himself to his disposal 4 So Johanan and the rulers that were with him not being able to persuade Gedaliah went away  but after the interval 01 thirty days was over Ishmael came again to Gedaliah to the tity Mispah and ten men with him and when he had feasted Ishmael and those that were with him in a splendid manner at his table and had given them presents he became disordered in drink while he endeavoured to be very merry with them and when Ishmael saw him in that case and that he was drowned in his cups to the degree of insensibility and fallen asleep he rose on a sudden with his ten friends and slew Gedaliah and those that were with him at the feast and when he had slain them he went out by night and slew all the Jews that were in the city and those soldiers also which were left therein by the Babylonians But the next day fourscore men came out of the 72 ANTIgUlTIES OF THE JEWS Book X country with presents to Gedaliah none of them knowing what had befallen him when Ishmael saw them he invited them in to Gedaliah and when they were come in he shut up the court and slew them and cast their dead bodies down into a certain deep pit that they might not be seen but of these fourscore men Ishmael spared those that entreated him not to kill them till they had delivered up to him what riches they had concealed in the fields consisting of their furniture and garments and corn but he took captive the people that were in Mispah with their wives and children among whom were the daughters of king Zedekiah whom Nebuzaradan the general of the army of Ba bylon had left with Gedaliah And when he had done this he came to the king of the Ammonites 5 But when Johanan and the rulers with him heard of what was done at Mispah by Ishmael and of the death of Gedaliah they had indignation at it and every one of them took his own armed men and came suddenly to fight with Ishmael and over took him at the fountain in Hebron And when those that were carried away captives by Ishmael saw Johanan and the rulers they were very glad and looked upon them as coming to their assistance so they left him that had carried them captives and came over to Johanan then Ishmael with eight men fled to the king of the Ammonites but Johanan took those whom he had rescued out of the hands of Ishmael and the eunuchs and their wives and children and came to a certain place called Man dra and there they abode that day for they had determined to remove from thence and go into Egypt out of fear lest the Babylonians should slay them in case they continued in the country and that out of anger at the slaughter of Gedaliah who had been by them set over it for governor 6 Now while they were under this deliberation Johanan the son of Kareah and the riders that were with him came to Je remiah the prophet and desired that he would pray to God that because they were at an utter loss about what they ought to do he would discover it to them and they sware that they would do whatsoever Jeremiah should say to them And when the pro phet said he would be their intercessor with God it came to pass that after ten days God appeared to him and said That he would inform Johanan and the other rulers and all the people that he would be with them while they continued in that coun try and take care of them and keep them from being hurt by the Babylonians of whom they were afraid but that he would desert them if they went into Egypt and out of his wrath against them would inflict the same punishments upon them which they knew their brethren had already endured kso when the prophet had infnrmwl Johanan and the people that Chap IX ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 75 God had foretold these things he was not believed when he said that God commanded them to continue in that country but they imagined that he said so to gratify Baruch his own disciple and belied God and that he persuaded them to stay there that they might be destroyed by the Babylonians Accordingly both the people and Johanan disobeyed the counsel of God which he gave them by the prophet and removed into Egypt and car ried Jeremiah and Baruch along with him 7 And when they were there God signified to the prophet that the king of Babylon was about making an expedition against the Egyptians and commanded him to foretell to the people that Egypt should be taken and the king of Babylon should slay some of them and should take others captive and bring them to Ba bylon which things came to pass accordingly for on the fifth year after the destruction of Jerusalem which was the twenty third of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar he made an expedition against Celcesyria and when he had possessed himself of it he made war against the Ammonites and Moabites and when he had brought all these nations under subjection he fell upon Egypt in order to overthrow it and he slew the  king that then reigned and set up another and he took those Jews that were there captives and led them away to Babylon And such was the end of the nation of the Hebrews as it hath been deli vered down to us it having gone twice beyond Euphrates for the people of the ten tribes were carried out of Samaria by the Assyrians in the days of king Hoshea after which the people of the two tribes that remained after Jerusalem was taken were carried away by Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon and Chaldea Now as to Shalmanezer he removed the Israelites out of their country and placed therein the nation of the Cu theans who had formerly belonged to the inner parts of Persia and Media but were then called Samaritans by taking the name of the country to which they were removed but the king of Babylon who brought out the two tribes  placed no other na tion in their country by which means all Judea and Jerusalem and the temple continued to be a desert for seventy years  but  Herodotus says this king of Ejrypt Pharaoh Hophra or Apries was slain by the Egyptians as Jeremiah foretold his slaughter by his enemies Jer xliv 29 3O and that as a sign of the destructior of Egypt by Nebuchadnezzar Josephus says tliis king was slain by Nebuchadnezzar himself  We see here that Judea was left in a manner desolate after the captivity of the two tribes and was not repeopled with foreign colonies perhaps as an indication of Providence that the Jews were to repeople it without opposition themselves I also esteem the latter and present desolate condition of the same country without being repeopled by foreign colonies to be a like indication that the same Jews are hereaf ter to repeople it again t Â mseWes at their so long expected future restoration 74 ANTIQUITIES OF THiI JEWS Book X the entire mterval of time which passed from the captivity of the Israelites to the carrying away of the two tribes proved to be an hundred and thirty years six months and ten days CHAR X Concerning Daniel and what befell him at Babylon Â 1 DUT new Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took some of the most noble of the Jews that were children and the kins men of Zedekiah their king such as were rem arkable for the beau ty of their bodies and the comeliness of their countenances and delivered them into the hands of tutors and to the improvement to be made by them He also made some of them to be eunuchs  which course he took also with those of other nations whom he had taken in the flower of their age and afforded them their diet from his own table and had them instructed in the insti tutes of the country and taught the learning of the Chaldeans and they had now exercised themselves sufficiently in that wis dom which he had ordered they should apply themselves to Now among these there were four of the family of Zedekiah 01 most excellent dispositions one of whom was called Daniel another was called Ananias another Mesael and the fourth Azarias And the king of Babylon changed their names and com manded that they should make use of other names Daniel he called Baltasar Ananias Shadrach Mesael Meshach and Aza rias Abednego These the king had in esteem and continued to love because of the very excellent temper they were of and because of their application to learning and the progress they had made in wisdom 2 Now Daniel and his kinsmen had resolved to use a severe diet and to abstain from those kinds of food which came from the king s table and entirely to forbear to eat of all living crea tures So he came to Ashpenaz who was that  eunuch to whom the care of them was committed and desired him to take and spend what was brought for them from the king but to give them pulse and dates for their food and any thing else besides the flesh of living creatures that he pleased for that their inclinations were to that sort of food and that they despised the  That Daniel was made one of these eunuchs of which Isaiah prophesied Isa xxxix 7 and the three children his companions also seems to me plain both here in Josephus and in our copies of Daniel Dan i 3 6 7â 11 18 although it must be granted that some married persons that had children were sometimes called eunuchs in a general acceptation for courtiers on account that so many of the an cient courtiers were real cunuchs See Gen zxxix 1  â Chap X ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS JS other He replied that he was ready to serve them in what they desired but he suspected that they would he discovered by the king from their meagre bodies and the alteration of their countenances because it could not be avoided but their bodies and colours must be changed with their diet especially while they would be clearly discovered by the finer appearance of the other children who would fare better and thus they should bring him in danger and occasion him to be punished yet did they persuade Arioch who was thus fearful to give them what food they desired for ten days by wny of trial and in case the habit of their bodies were not altered to go on in the same way as expecting that they should not be hurt thereby afterwards but if he saw them look meagre and worse than the rest he should reduce them to their former diet Now when it appeared that they were so far from becoming worse by the use of this food that they grew plumper and fuller in body than the rest inso much that he thought those who fed on what came from the king s table seemed less plump and full while those that were with Da niel looked as if they had lived in plenty and all sorts of luxury Arioch from that time securely took himself what the king sent every day from his supper according to custom to the children but gave them the forementioned diet while they had their souls in some measure more pure and less burdened and so fitter for learning and had their bodies in better tune for hard labour for they neither had the former oppressed and heavy with variety of meats nor were the other effeminate on the same account so they readily understood all the learning that was among the Hebrews and among the Chaldeans as es pecially did Daniel who being already sufficiently skilful in wis dom was very busy about the interpretation of dreams and God manifested himself to him   3 Now two years after the destruction of Egypt king Ne buchadnezzar saw a wonderful dream the accomplishment of which God showed him in his sleep but when he arose out of his bed he forgot the accomplishment So he sent for the Chal deans and magicians and the prophets and told them that he had seen a dream and informed them that he had forgotten the accomplishment of what he had seen and he enjoined them to tell him both what the dream was and what was its signification and they said that this was a thing impossible to be discovered by men but they promised him that if he would explain to them what dream he had seen they would tell him its signification Hereupon he threatened to put them to death unless they told him his dream and he gave command to have them all put to death since they confessed they could not do what they were commanded to do Now when Daniel heard that the king had VOL II 76 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book X given a command that all the wise men should be put to death and that among them himself and his three kinsmen were in dan ger he went to Arioch who was captain of the king s guards and desired to know of him what was the reason why the king had given command that all the wise men and Chaldeans and magicians should be slain So when he had learned that the king had had a dream and had forgotten it and that when they were enjoined to inferm the king of it they had said they could not do it and had thereby provoked him to anger he desired of Arioch that he would go in to the king and desire respite for the magicians for one night and to put off their slaughter so long for that he hoped within that time to obtain by prayer to God the knowledge of the dream Accordingly Arioeh informed the king of what Daniel desired So the kmg bid them delay the slaughter of the magicians till he knew what Daniel s promise would come to but the young man retired to his own house with his kinsmen and besought God that whole night to dis cover the dream and thereby deliver the magicians and Chal deans with whom they were themselves to perish from the king s anger by enabling him to declare his vision and to make manifest what the king had seen the night before in his sleep but had forgotten it Accordingly God out of pity to those that were in danger and out of regard to the wisdom of Daniel made known to him the dream and its_ interpretation that so the king might understand by him its signification also When Daniel had obtamed this knowledge from God he arose very joyful and told it his brethren and made them glad and to hope well that they should now preserve their Eves of which they despaired before and had their minds full of nothing but the thoughts of dying So when he had with them returned thanks to God who had commiserated their youth when it was day he came to Arioch and desired him to bring him to the king because he would discover to him that dream which he had seen the night before 4 When Daniel was come in to the king he excused himsel first that he did not pretend to be wiser than the other Chal deans and magicians when upon their entire inability to dis cover his dream he was undertaking to inform him of it for this was not by his own skill or on account of his having befr ter cultivated his understanding than the rest but he said God hath had pity upon us when we were in danger of death and when I prayed for the life of myself and of those of my own nation hath made manifest to me both the dream and the in terpretation thereof for I was not less concerned for thy glory than for the sorrow that we were by thee condemned to die wlu le thou didst so unjustly command mens both good and Chap X ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 77  excellent iii themselves to be put to death when thou cnjoinedst them to do what was entirely above the reach of human wis dom and requiredst of them what was the work only of God Wherefore as thou in thy sleep was solicitous concerning those that should succeed thee in the government of the whole world God was desirous to show thee all those that should reign after thee and to that end exhibited to thee the follow ing drtam Thou seemedst to see a great image standing be fore thee the head of which proved to be of gold the shoulders and arms of silver and the belly and thethighs of brass but the legs and the feet of iron  after which thou sawest a stone bro ken off from a mountain which fell upon the image and threw it down and brake it to pieces and did not permit any part of it to remain whole but the gold the silver the iron and die brass became smaller than meal which upon the blast of a vio lent wind was by force carried away and scattered abroad but the stone did increase to such a degree that the whole earth beneath it seemed to be filled therewith This is the dream which thou sawest and its interpretation is as follows The head of gold denotes thee and the kings of Babylon that have been before theej but the two hands and arms signify this that your government shall be dissolved by two kings but an  other king that shall come from the west armed with brass shall destroy that government and another government that shall be like unto iron shall put an end to the power of the far mer and shall have dominion over all the earth on account Â the nature of iron which is stronger than that of gold of sil ver and of brass Daniel did also declare the meaning of the  stone to the king but I do not think proper to relate it since I have only undertaken to describe things past or things present tut not things that are future yet if any one be so very desi rous of knowing truth as not to wave such points of curiosity and cannot curb his inclination for understanding the uncertain ties of futurity and whether they will happen or not let him be diligent in reading the book of Daniel which he will find among the sacred writings 5 When Nebuchadnezzar heard this and recollected his dream lie was astonished at the nature of Daniel and fell upon his face  Of this most remarkable passage in Josophus concerning the stone cut out nj the mountain and destroyed the image which he would not explain hut intimated v be  prophecy of futurity and probably not safe for him to explain as belonging to the destruction of the Roman empire by Jesus Christ the

of the destruction of that city which tlwy calluUhe eternal  78 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book X and saluted Daniel in the manner that men worship God and gave command that he should be sacrificed to as a god And this was not all for he also imposed the name of his own god upon him Baltasar and made him and his kinsmen rulers of his whole kingdom which kinsmen of his happened to fall into great dan ger by the envy and malice of their enemies for they offend ed the king upon the occasion following he made an image of gold whose height was sixty cubits and its breadth six cubits and set it in the great plain of Babylon and when he was going to dedicate the image he invited the principal men out of all the earth that was under his dominions and commanded them in the first place that when they should hear the sound of the trumpet they should then fall down and worship the image and he threat ened that those who did not so should be cast into a fiery fur nace When therefore all the rest upon the hearing of the sound of the trumpet worshipped the image they related that Daniel s kinsmen did not do it because they would not transgress the laws of their country So these men were convicted and cast immedi ately into the fire but were saved by divine providence and af ter a surprising manner escaped death for the fire did not touch them and I suppose that it touched them not as if it reasoned with itself that they were cast into it without any fault of theirs fmd that therefore it was too weak to burn the young men when they were in it This was done by the power of God who made their bodies so far superior to the fire that it could not consume them This it was which recommended them to the king as righteous men and men beloved of God on which account they continued in great esteem with him 6 A little after this the king saw in his sleep again another vision how he should fall from his dominion and feed among die wild beasts and that when he had lived in this manner in the desert for  seven years he should recover his dominion again  Since Joscpbus here explains the seven prophetic times which were to pass over Nebuchadnezzar Dan iv 16 to be seven years we thence learn how he most pro bably must have understood those other parallel phrases of a time times and an half Antiq B VII chap xxv of so many prophetic years also though he withal lets us know by this hint at the interpretation of the seventy ivtieks as belonging to the fourth monarchy and the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans in the days of Josephus chap ii sect 7 that he did not think those years to be bare years but ga ther days Jar years by which reckoning and by which alone could 70 weeks or 4 9O days reach to the age of Josephus But as to the truth of those seven years banishment of Nebuchadnezzar from men and his living so long among the beasts the very small remains we have any where else of this Nebuchadnezzar prevent our expectation of any other full account of it So far we know by Ptolemy s canon a contemporary record as well as by Josephus presently that he reigned in all 43 years that is eight years after we meet with any account of his actions one of the last of which was the 13 years siege of Tyre Antiq B X chap xi where yet the Old Latin has but three years and ten months yet were his actions before so remark Chap XI ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 79 When he had seen this dream he called the magicians together again and inquired of them about it and desired them to tell him what it signified but when none of them could find out the meaning of the dream nor discover it to the king Daniel was the only person that explained it and as he foretold so it came to pass for after he had continued in the wilderness the fore mentioned interval of time while no one durst attempt to seize his kingdom during those seven years he prayed to God that he might recover his kingdom and he returned to it But let no one blame me for writing down every thing of this nature as I find it in our ancient books for as to that matter J have plainly assured those that think me defective in any such point or complain of my management and have told them in the beginning of this history that I intended to do no more than translate the Hebrew books into the Greek language and promised them to explain those facts without adding any thing to them of my own or taking any thing

prophecies he delivered there J 1 JN ow when king Nebuchadnezzar had reigned  forty three years he ended his life He was an active man and more fortunate than the kings that were before him Now Berosus makes mention of his actions in the third book of his Chaldaic history where he says thus When his father Nebuchodonosor Nabopollassar heard that the governor whom he had set over Egypt and the places about Celoesyria and Phenicia had revolted from him while he was not himself able any longer to undergo the hardships of war he committed to his son Ne buchadnezzar who was still but a youth some parts of his army and sent them against them So when Ncbuchadnez zar had given battle and fought with the rebel he beat him and reduced the country from under his subjection and made able both in sacred and profane authors that such vacuity of eight years at the least at the latter end of his reign must be allowed to agree very well with Daniel s accounts that after a seven years brutal life he might return to his reason and to the exercise of bio royal authority for one whole year at least before his death  These 45 years for the duration of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar are as I have just now observed the very same number in Ptolemy s canon Moses Chorenensis does also confirm this captivity of the Jews under Nebuchadnezzar and adds what is very remarkable that one ofthoae Jews that were carried by him into captivity got away into Armenia and raised the great family of the Bagraditx there 80 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book X it a branch of his own kingdom but about that time it happen ed that his father Nebuchodonosor Nabopollassar fell ill and ended his life in the city Babylon when he had reigned  twenty one years and when he was made sensible as he was in a little time Jthat his father Nebuchodonosor Nabopollas sar was dead and having settled the affairs of Egypt and the other countries as also those that concerned the captive Jews and Phoenicians and Syrians and those of the Egyptian nations and having committed the conveyance of them to  Babylon to certain of his friends together with the gross of his army and the rest of their ammunition and provisions he went himself hastily accompanied with a few others over the desert and came to Babylon So he took upon him the management of public affairs and of the kingdom which had been kept for him by one that was the principal of the Chaldeans and he received the entire dominions of his father  and appointed that when the captives came they should be placed as colonies in the most proper places of Babylonia but then he adorned the temple of Belus and the rest of the temples in a magnificent manner with the spoils he had taken 41 in war He also added another city to that which was there of old and rebuilt it that such as would besiege it hereafter might no more turn the course of the river and thereby attack the city itself He therefore built three walls round about the inner city apd three others about that which was the outer and this he did with burnt brick And after he had after a becoming manner walled the city and adorned its gates glo riously he built another palace before his father s palace but so that they joined to it to describe whose vast height and immense riches it would perhaps be too much for me to at tempt yet as large and lofty as they were they were com pleted

are also the very same with those given him in Ptolemy s canon And note here that what Dr Prideaux says at the year 612 that Nebuchadnezzar must have been a common name of the other kings of Babylon besides the great Nebuchadnezzar himself is a groundless mistake of some modern chronologers only and destitute of all proper original authority f These fifteen days for finishing such vast buildings at Babylon in Josephus copy of Berosus would seem too absurd to be supposed to be the true number were it not for the same testimony extant also in the first book against Apion Â 19 with the same number It thence indeed appears that Josephus copy of Berosus had this small number but that it is the true number I still doubt  Josephus assures us that the walls of so much a smaller city as Jerusalem were two years and four months in building by Nchcmiah who yet hastened the work all he could Antiq B XI chap v sect 8 I should think 115 days or a year and 15 days much morÂ proportionable

pensile paradise because his wile was desirous to have things like her own country she having been bred up in the palaces of Media Megasthenes also in his fourth book of his accounts of India makes mention of these things and thereby endeavours to show that this king Nebuchadnezzar exceeded Hercules in fortitude and in the greatness of his actions for he saith that he conquered a great part of Lybia and Iberia Diocles also in the second book of his accounts of Persia mentions this king as does Phi lostrates in his accounts both of India and of Phenicia say that this king besieged Tyre thirteen years while at the same time Ethball reigned at Tyre These are all the histories that I have met with concerning this king 2 But now after the death of Nebuchadnezzar Evil Mero dach his son succeeded in the kingdom who immediately set Je coniah at liberty and esteemed him among his most intimate friends He also gave him many presents and made him honour able above the rest of the kings that were in Babylon for his fa ther had not kept his faith with Jeconiah when he voluntarily delivered up himself to him with his wives and children and his whole kindred for the sake of his country

years and then ended his life and after him the succession in the king dom came to his son Labofordacus â who continued in it in all but nine months and when he was dead it came to  Baltasar who by the Babylonians was called Naboandelus against him did Cyrus the king of Persia and Darius the king of Media make  It is here remarkable that Josephus without the knowledge of Ptolemy s canon should call the same king whom he himself here Bar i 11 and Dan v 1 2 9 12 22 29 30 styles Beltazar or Belihatzar from the Babylonian god Bel Neboan ilelus also but in the first book against Apion sect 19 vol iii from the same citation out of Berosus Nabonnedon from the Babylonian god Nabo or Nebo This last is not remote from the original pronunciation itself in Ptolemy s canon Nabonadiut for both the place of this king in that canon as the last of the Assyrian or Babylo nian kings and the number of years of his reign seventeen the same in both de monstrate that it is one and the same king that is meant by them all It is also worth noting that Josephus knew that Darius the partner of Cyrus was the son of Astyages and was called by another name among the Greeks though it does not ap pear he knew what that name was as having never seen the best history of this pe riod which is Xenophen s But then what Josephus present copies say presently sect 4 that it was only within no long time after the hand writing on the wall that ISeltasar was slain does not so agree with our copies of Daniel which say it was the lame night Dan v 30 82 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book X war and when he was besieged in Babylon there happened a wonderful and prodigious vision He was sat down at supper hi a large room and there were a great many vessels of silver such as were made for royal entertainments and he had with him his concubines and his friends whereupon he came to a resolution and commanded that those vessels of God which Nebuchadnezzar had plundered out of Jerusalem and had not made use of but had put them into his own temple should be brought out of that temple He also grew so haughty as to proceed to use them in the midst pf his cups drinking out of them and blaspheming against God In the mean time he saw a hand proceed out ot the wall and writing upon the wall certain syllables at which sight being disturbed he called the magicians and Chaldeans to gether and all that sort of men that are among these Barbarians and were able to interpret sighs and dreams that they might ex plain the writing to him But when the magicians said they could discover nothing nor did understand it the king was ia great disorder of mind and under great trouble at this surprising accident so he caused it to be proclaimed through all the coun try and promised that to him who could explain the writing and give the signification couched therein he would give him a golden chain for his neck and leave to wear a purple garment as did the kings of Chaldea and would bestow on him the third part of his own dominions When this proclamation was made the magicians ran together more earnestly and were very ambitious to find out the importance of the writing but still hesitated about it as much as before Now when the king s  grandmother saw him cast down at this accident she began to encourage him and to say that  there was a certain captive who came from Judea a Jew by birth but brought away thence by Nebuchadnezzar when he had destroyed Jerusalem whose name was Daniel a wise man and one of great sagacity in finding out what was impossible for others to discover and what was known to God alone who brought to light and answered such questions to Nebuchadnezzar as no one else was able to an swer when they were consulted She therefore desired thai he would send for him and inquire of him concerning th writing and to condemn the unskilful ness of those that could not find their meaning and this although what God signified thereby should be of a melancholy nature  This grandmother or mother of Baltasar the queen Dowager of Babylon for she is distinguished from his queen Dan v 1O 23 seems to have been the famous Jitceris who fortified Babylon against the Medes and Persians and in all probabi lity governed under BalUsar who seems to have been a weak and effeminate prince Chilp XI ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 83 3 When Baltasar heard this he called for Daniel and when he had discoursed to him what he had learned concerning him and his wisdom and how a divine spirit was with him and thaf he alone was fully capable of finding out what others wouk never have thought of he desired him to declare to him what this writing meant That if he did so he would give him leave to wear purple and to put a chain of gold about his neck and would bestow on him the third part of his dominion as an hon orary reward for his wisdom that thereby he might become illustrious to those who saw him and who inquired upon what occasion he obtained such honours But Daniel desired That he would keep his gifts to himself for what is the effect of wisdom and of divine revelation admits of no gifts and be stows its advantages on petitioners freely but that still he would explain the writing to him which denoted that he should soon die and this because he had not learnt to honour God atid not to admit things above human nature by what punish ments his progenitors had undergone for the injuries he ha d offered to God and because he had quite forgotten how Ne buchadnezzar was removed to feed among wild beasts fbf his impieties and did not recover his former fife among men and his kingdom but upon God s mercy to him after many sup plications and prayers who did thereupon praise God all the days of his life as one of almighty power and who takes care of mankind He also put him in mind how he had greatly blasphemed against God and had made use of his vessels amongst his concubines that therefore God saw this and was angry with him and declared by this writing beforehand what a sad conclusion of his life he should come to And he explained the writing thus â MANEH This if it be ex pounded in the Greek language may signify a Ntimber be cause God hath numbered so long a time for thy life and for thy government and that there remains but a small portion THEKEL This signifies a Weight and means that God hath weighed thy kingdom in a balance and finds it going down already PHARES This also in the Greek tongue denotes a Fragment God will therefore break thy kingdom in pieces and divide it among the Medes and Persians 4 When Daniel had told the king that the writing upon the wall signified these events Baltasar was in great sorrow and af fliction as was to be expected when the interpretation was so heavy upon him However he did not refuse what he had pro raised Daniel although he were become a foreteller of misfor tunes to him but bestowed it all upon him as reasoning thus that what he was to reward was peculiar to himself and to fate and did not belong to the prophet but that it was the part of a VOL II  IT S 4Â ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book X good and a just man to give what he had promised although the events were of n melancholy nature Accordingly the king de termined so to do Now after a little while both himself and the city were taken by Cyrus the king of Persia who fought against him j for it was Baltasar under whom Babylon was taken when he had reigned seventeen years And this is the cud of the posterity of king Nebuchadnezzar as history informs us but when Babylon was taken by Darius and when he with his kinsman Cyrus had put an end to the dominion of the Babylonians he was sixty two years old He wag the sou of Astyages and had another name among the Greeks More over he took Daniel the prophet and carried him with him into Media and honoured hirti very greatly and kept him with him for he was one of the three presidents whom he set over his three hundred and sixty provinces for into so many did Darius part them 5 However while Daniel was in so great a dignity and in so great favour with Darius and was alone intrusted with every thing by him as having somewhat divine in him he was envied by the rest for those that see others in greater honour than themselves with kings envy them and when those that were grieved at the great favour Daniel was in with Da rius sought for au occasion against him he afforded them no occasion at all for he was above all the temptations of money and despised bribery and esteemed it a very base thing to take any thing by way of reward even when it might be justly given him he afforded those that envied him not the least handle for an accusation So when they could find nothing for which they might calumniate him to the king nothing that was shameful or reproachful and thereby deprive him of the hon our he was in with him they sought for some other method whereby they might destroy him When therefore they saw that DaniÂ l prayed to God three times a day they thought they had gotten an occasion by which they might ruin him so they came to Darius and told him That the princes and governors had thought proper to allow the multitude a relaxation for thirty days that no one might offer a petition or prayer either to himself or to the gods but that he who shall transgress this decree shall be cast into the den of lions and there perish 6 Whereupon the king being not acquainted with their wicked design nor suspecting that it was a contrivance of theirs against Daniel said he was pleased with this decree of theirs and he promised to confirm what they desired he also published an edict to promulgate to the people that decree which the princes had made Accordingly all the rest took care not to transgress those injunctions and rested in quiet but Daniel had no regard Chap XI ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS  to them bat as he was wont he stood and prayed to God in the sight of them all but the princes having met with the oo casion they so earnestly sought to find against Daniel came pre sently to the king and accused him that Daniel was the only person that transgressed the decree while not one of the rest durst pray to their gods This discovery they made not be cause of his impiety but because they had watched him and ob served him out of envy for supposing that Darius did thus out of a greater kindness to him than they expected and that he was ready to grant him pardon for this contempt of his injunctions and envying this very pardon to Daniel they did not become more favourable to him but desired he might be cast into the den of lions according to the law So Darius hoping that God would deliver him and that he would undergo nothing that was terrible by the wild beasts bid him bear this accident cheerful ly And when he was cast into the den Jie put his seal to the stone that lay upon the mouth of the den and went iiis way but he passed all the night without food and without sleep being in great distress for Daniel But when it was day he got up and came to the den and found the seal entire which he had left the stone sealed withal he also opened the seal and cried out and called to Daniel and asked him If he were alive And as soon as he heard the king s voice and said that he had suffered no harm the king gave order that he should be drawn up out of tho den Now when his enemies saw that Daniel had suffered no thing which was terrible they would not own that he was pre served by God and by his providence but they said that the lions had been filled full with food and on that account it was Â s they supposed that the lions would not touch Daniel nor come to him and this they alleged to the king But the king out of an abhorrence of their wickedness gave order that they should throw in a great deal of flesh to the lions and when they had nlled themselves he gave farther order that Daniel s ene mies should be cast into the den that he might learn whether the lions now they were full would touch them or not And it appeared plain to Darius after the princes had been cast to the wild beasts that it was God who preserved Daniel  for the lions spared none of them but tore them all to pieces as they had been very hungry and wanted food I suppose therefore  It is no way improbable that Daniel s enemies might suggest this reason to the king why the lions did not meddle with him and that they suspected the king s kind ness to Daniel had procured these lions to be so filled beforehand and that thence H was that be encouraged Daniel to submit to this experiment in hopes of coming off safe and that this was the true reason of makhig so terrible an experiment up on those his enemies and all their t iuuilies Dan Ti 21 though our other copiw do not directly take notice of it 86 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book X it was not their hunger which had been a little before satisfied with abundance of flesh but the wickedness of these men that provoked them to destroy the princes for if it so please God that wickedness might by even those irrational creatures be esteemed a plain foundation for their punishment 7 When therefore those that had intended thus to destroy Da niel by treachery were themselves destroyed king Darius sent letters over all the country and praised that God whom Da niel worshipped and said That he was the only true God and had all power He had also Daniel in very great esteem and made him the principal of his friends Now when Daniel was become so illustrious and famous on account of the opinion men had that he was beloved of God he built a tower at Ecba tana in Media it was a most elegant building and wonderfully made and it is still remaining and preserved to this day and to such as see it it appears to have been lately built and to have been no older than that very day when any one looks upon it it is  so fresh flourishing and beautiful and no way grown old in so long time for buildings suffer the same as men do they grow old as well as they and by numbers of years their strength is dissolved and their beauty withered Now they bury the kings of Media of Persia and Parthia in this tower to this day and he who was entrusted with the care of it was a Jewish priest which thing is also observed to this day But it is fit to give an account of what this man did which is most admirable to hear for he was so happy as to have strange revelations made to him and those as to one of the greatest of the prophets insomuch that while he was alive he had the esteem and applause both of the kings and of the multitude and now he is dead he retains a remembrance that will never fail for the several books that he wrote and left behind him are still read by us till this time and from them we believe that Daniel conversed with God for he did not only prophesy of future events as did the other prophets but he also determined the time of their accomplish ment And while prophets used to foretel misfortunes and on that account were disagreeable both to the kings and to the mul titude Daniel was to them a prophet of good things and this to such a degree that by the agreeable nature of his predictions he procured the good will pf all men and by the accomplish  What Josephus here sayn that the stones of the sepulchres of the kings of Per sia at this tower or those perhaps of the same sort that are now commonly called the ruins of Persepolis continued so entire and unaltered in his days as if they were lately put there  I says Reland here can show to he true as to those stones of the Persian kings mausoleum which Corn Brunius brake off and gave me He ascrjbed this to the hardness of the stone which scarcely yields to iron tools an proves frequently too hard fur cutting by the chissel but oftentimes breaks intt pieces Chap XL ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 87 ment of them he procured the belief of their truth and the opinion of a sort of divinity for himself among the multitude He also wrote and left behind him what made manifest the ac curacy and undeniable veracity of his predictions For he saith That  when he was in Susa the metropolis of Persia and went out into the field with his companions there was on the sud den a motion and concussion of the earth and that he was left alone by himself his friends flying away from him and that he was disturbed and fell on his face and on his two hands and that a certain person touched him and at the same time bid him rise and see what would befall his countrymen after many generations He also related that when he stood up he was shown a great ram with many horns growing out of his head and that the last was higher than the rest that after this he looked to the west and saw a he goat carried through the air from that quarter that he rushed upon the ram with violence and smote him twice with his horns and  overthrew him to the ground and trampled upon him that afterward he saw a very great horn growing out of the head of the he goat and that when it was broken off four horns grew up that were exposed to each of the four winds and he wrote that out of them arose another lesser horn which as he said waxed great and that God showed to him that it should fight against his nation and take their city by force and bring the temple worship to confusion and forbid the sacrifices to be offered for one thousand two hundred and ninety six days Daniel wrote that he saw these visions in the plain of Susa and he hath informed us that God interpreted the appearance of this vision after the following manner He said that the ram signi fied the kingdoms of the Medes and Persians and the horns  those kings that were to reign in them and that the last  horn signified the last king and that he should exceed all the kings in riches and glory that the goat signified that one should come and reign from the Greeks who should twice fight with the Persian and overcome him in battle and should receive his entire dominion that by the great horn which sprang out of the forehead of the he goat was meant the first king and that the springing up of four horns upon its falling off and the conversion of every one of them to the four quar ters of the earth signified the successors that should arise after the death of the first king and the partition of the kingdom among them and that they should be neither his children nor of his kindred that should reign over the habitable earth for many years and that from among them there should arise a certain king that should overcome our nation and their laws and should take away their political government and should 83  ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book X spoil the temple and forbid the sacrifices to be offered for three years time And indeed so it came to pass that our nation suffered these things under Antiochus Epiphanes ac cording to Daniel s vision and what he wrote many years be fore they came to pass In the very same manner Daniel also wrote concerning the Roman government and that our country should be made desolate by them Ah1 these things did this man leave in writing as God had showed them to him inso much that such as read his prophecies and see how they have been fulfilled would wonder at the honour wherewith God hon oured Daniel and may thence discover how the Epicureans are in an error who cast providence out of human life and do not be lieve that God takes care of the affairs of the world nor that the universe is governed and continued in being by that blessed and immortal nature but say that the world is carried along of its own accord without a ruler and a curator which were it des titute of a guide to conduct it as they imagine it would be like ships without pilots which we see drowned by the winds or like chariots without drivers which are overturned so would the world be dashed in pieces by its being carried without a Providence and so perish and come to nought So that by the forementioned predictions of Daniel those men seem to me very much to err from the truth who determine that God exercises no providence over human affairs for if that were the case that the world went on by mechanical necessity we should not see that all things would come to pass according to his prophecy Now as to myself I have so described these matters as I have found them and read them but if any one is inclined to another opinion about them let him enjoy his different sentiments without any blame from me Chap I ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 69 BOOK XL CONTAINING THE INTERVAL OF TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THREE YEARS AND FIVE MONTHS FROM THE FIRST OF CYRUS TO THE DEATH OF ALEXAN DER THE GREAT CHAP I How Cyrus king of the Persians delivered the Jews out of Baby lon and suffered them to return to their own country and to build their temple for which work he gave them money J 1 IN the first year of the reign of  Cyrus which was the seventieth from the day that our people were removed out of their own land into Babylon God commiserated the captivity and calamity of these poor people according as he had fiStetold to them by Jeremiah the prophet before the destruction of the city that after they had served Nebuchadnezzar and his posteri ty and after they had undergone that servitude seventy years he would restore them again to the land of their fathers and they should build their temple and enjoy their ancient prosperity And these things God did afford them for he stirred up the mind of Cyrus and made him write this throughout all Asia Thus saith Cyrus the king since God Almighty hath appoint edme to be king of the habitable earth I believe that he is that God which the nation of the Israelites worship for indeed he foretold my name by the prophets and that I should build him an house at Jerusalem in the country of Judea 2 This was known to Cyrus by his reading the book which Isaiah left behind him of his prophecies for this prophet said that God hath spoken thus to him in a secret vision  My will is that Cyrus whom I have appointed to be king over many and great nations send back my people to their own land and build my temple This was foretold by Isaiah one hundred and forty years before the temple Was demolished Accordingly when  This Cyrus is called God s shepherd by Xenophon as well as by Isaiah Isa xliv 28 as also it is said of him by the same prophet that  I will make a man more precious than fine gold even a man than the golden wedge of Ophir Isa xiii 12 which character makes Xenophon s most excellent history of him very credible 90 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XL Cyrus read this and admired the divine power an earnest de sire and ambition seized upon him to fulfil what was so written so he called for the most eminent Jews that were in Babylon and said to them that he gave them leave to go back to their own country and to rebuild  their city Jerusalem and the temple of God for that he would be their assistant and that he would write to the rulers and governors that were in the neighbourhood of their country of Judea that they should contribute to them gold and silver for the building of the temple and besides that beasts for their sacrifices 3 When Cyrus had said this to the Israelites the rulers of the two tribes of Judah and Benjamin with the Levites and priests went in haste to Jerusalem yet did many of them stay at Babylon as not willing to leave their possessions and when they were come thither all the king s friends assisted them and brought in for the building of the temple some gold and some silver and some a great many cattle and horses So they per formed their vows to God and offered the sacrifices that had been accustomed of old time I mean this upon the rebuilding of their city and the revival of the ancient practices relating to their worship Cyrus also sent back to them the vessels of God which king Nebuchadnezzar had pillaged out of the temple and had carried to Babylon So he committed these things to Mith ridates the treasurer to be sent away with an order to give them to Sanabassar that he might keep them till the temple was built and when it was finished he might deliver them to the priests and rulers of the multitude in order to their being restored to the temple Cyrus also sent an epistle to the gov ernors that were in Syria the contents whereof here follow King CYRUS to SISINNES and SATHRABUZANES sendetk greeting I have given leave to as many of the Jews that dwell in my country as please to return to their

also sent the Vessels which king Nebuchadnezzai pillaged out of the temple and have given them to Mithri dates the treasurer and to Zorobabel the governor of the Jews that they may have them carried to Jerusalem and may restore them to the temple of God Now their  num ber is as follows fifty chargers of gold and five hundred of silver forty Thericleon cups of gold and five hundred of silver fifty basons of gold and five hundred of silver thirty vessels for pouring the drink offerings and three hundred of silver thirty vials of gold and two thousand four hundred of silver with a thousand other large vessels I permit them to have the same honour which they were used to have from their forefathers as also for their small cattle and for wine and oil two hundred and five thousand and five hundred drachmae and for wheat flour twenty thousand and five hundred artabae and I give order that these expenses shall be given them out of the tributes due from Samaria The priests shall also offer these sacrifices according to the laws of Moses in Jerusalem and when they offer them they shall pray to God for the preservation of the king and of his family that the kingdom of Persia may continue

captives besought the governors and those that had the care of such affairs that they would interrupt the Jews both hi the rebuilding of their city and in the building of their tem ple Npw as these men were corrupted by them with money they sold the Cutheans their interest for rendering this building a slow and a careless work for Cyrus who was busy about other wars knew nothing of all this and it so happened that when he had led his army against the  Massagetae he ended his life But when Cambyses the son of Cyrus had taken the kingdom the governor in Syria and Pnenicia and in the countries of Ammon and Moab and Samaria wrote an epis tle to Cambyses whose contents were as follows  To OUF Lord Cambyses we thy servants Rathunms the historiographer H and Semellius the scribe and the rest that are thy judges in Syria and Phenicia sendeth greeting If is fit O King that thou shouldest know that these Jews which were car ried to Babylon are come into our country and are build ing that rebellious and wicked city and its market places and setting up its walls and raising up the temple know therefore that when these things are finished they will not  be willing to pay tribute nor will they submit to thy com mands but will resist kings and will choose rather to rule over M others than be ruled over themselves We therefore thought it proper to write to thee O king while tire works about the temple are going on so fast and not to overlook this matter that thou mayest search into the books of thy fathers for thou wilt find in them that the Jews have been rebels and enemies to kings as hath their city been also which for that reason hath been till now laid waste We thought proper also to inform thee of this matter because thou niay est otherwise perhaps be ignorant of it that if this city be  Josi phus here follows Herodotus and those that related how Cyrus mÂ de war with the Scythians and Massagets rear the Caspian sea and perished in it while Xenophon s account which appears never to have been seen by Josephus that Cyrus died in peace in his own country of Persia is attested to by the writers of the affairs of Alexander the Great when they agree that he found Cyrus sepulchre at Pasargadas near Perscpolis This account of Xenophon s is also conHrmcd by the circumstances of Cambyses upon his succession to Cyrus who instead of a war to avenge his father s death upon the Scythians and Massagets and to prevent those nations from overruning his northern pro vinces which would have been the natural consequence of his father s ill success and death there went immediately to an Egyptian war long ago begun by Cyrus according to Xenophon page 644 and conquered that kingdom nor is there that 1 ever heard of the least mention in the reign of Cambyses of any war against the Scythians and Massagets that lie was ever engaged in all his life  I Chap III ANTIQUITIES OF THE JKWS 8 once inhabited and be entirely encompassed with walls thoa wilt be excluded from thy passage to Celesyriaand Phenicia 2 When Cambyses had read the epistle being naturally wicked he was irritated at what they told him and wrote back to them as follows Cambyses the king to Rathumus the a historiographer to Beeltethmus to Semellius the scribe and the rest that are in commission and dwelling in Samaria and Phenicia after this manner I have read the epistle that was sent from you and I gave order that the books of my forefathers should be searched into and it is there found that this city hath always been an enemy to Icings and its in habitants have raised seditions and wars We also are sensi ble that their kings have been powerful and tyrannical and have exacted tribute of Celesyria and PheHicia Wherefore I give order that the Jews shall not be permitted to build that city lest such mischief as they used to bring upon kings be greatly augmented When this epistle was read Rathumus and Semellius the scribe and the r associates got suddenly on horseback and made haste to Jerusalem they also brought a great company with them and forbade the Jews to build the city and the temple Accordingly these works were hindered from going on till the second year of the reign of Darius for nine years more for Cambyses reigned six years and within that time overthrew Egypt and when he was come back he died at Damascus CHAP III How offer the death of Cambyses and the slaughter of the Magi but under the reign of Darius Zorobabel was superior to the rest in the solution of problems and thereby obtained this fa vour of the king that the temple should be built  1 AFTER the slaughter of the Magi who upon the death of Cambyses attained the government of the Persian s for a year those families which were called the seven families of the Persians appointed Darius the son of Hystaspes to be their king Now he while he was a private man had made a vow to God that if he came to be king he would send all the vessels of God that were in Babylon to the temple at Jeru salem Now it so fell out that about this time Zorobabel who had been made governor cf the Jews that iiad been in captivity came to Darius from Jerusalem for there had been an old friendship between him and the king He was also with two others thought worthy to be guards of the king s body and ob tained that honour which he hoped for  2 Now in the first year of the king s reign Darius feasted JH ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWSi Book XL those that were about him and those born in his house with the rulers of the Medes and princes of the Persians and the toparchs of India and Ethiopia and the generals of the armies of his hundred and twenty seven provinces But when they had eaten and drank to satiety and abundantly they every one dei parted to go to bed at their own houses and Darius the king went to bed but after he had rested a little part of the night he awaked and not being able to sleep any more he fell into conversation with the three guards of his body and promised that to him who should make an oration about points that he should inquire of such as should be most agreeable to truth and to the dictates of wisdom he would grant it as a reward of his victory to put on a purple garment and to drink in cups of gold and to sleep upon gold and to have a chariot with bridles of gold and to sit next to himself on account of his wisdom and says he he shall be called my cousin Now when he had promised to give them these gifts he asked the first of them Whether wine was not the strongest The second Whether kings were not such And the third Whether women were not such Or whether truth was not the strongest of all When he had proposed that they should make their inquiries about those problems he went to rest but in the morning he sent for his great men his princes and toparchs of Persia and Media and set himself down in the place where he used to give audience and bid each of the guards of his body to declare what they thought proper concerning the proposed questions in the hearing of them all 3 Accordingly the first of them began to speak of the strength of wine and demonstrated it thus When said he I am to give my opinion of wine O you men I find that it exceeds every thing by the following indications It deceives the minds of those that drink it and reduces that of the king to the same state with that of the orphan and he who stands in need of a tutor and erects that of the slave to the boldness of  him that is free and that of the needy becomes like that of the rich man for it changes and renews the souls of men when it gets into them and it quenches the sorrow of those that are under calamities and makes men forget the debts they owe to others and makes them think themselves to be of all men the richest it makes them talk of no small things  but of talents and such other names as become wealthy men only nay more it makes them insensible of their command ers and of their kings and takes away the remembrance of their friends and companions for it arms men even against those that are dearest to them and makes them appear the ff greatest strangers to them and when they are become sober  III ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 95  and they have slept out their wine in the night they arise  without knowing any thing they have done in their cups J take these for signs of power and by them discover that wine is the strongest and most insuperable of all things 4 As soon as the first had given the fore mentioned demon strations of the strength of wine he left off and the next to him began to speak about the strength of a king and demonstrated that it was the strongest of all and more powerful than any thing else that appears to have any force or wisdom He began his demonstration after the following manner and said They are men who govern all things they force the earth and the sea to become profitable to them in what they desire and over these men do king s rule and over them they have authority Now those men who rule over that animal which is of all the strongest and most powerful must needs deserve to be esteem ed insuperable in power and force for example when these kings command their subjects to make war and undergo  dangers they are hearkened to and when they send them against their enemies their power is so great that they are obeyed They command men to level mountains and to pull  down walls and towers nay when they are commanded to be killed and to kill they submit to it that they may not ap  pear to transgress the king s commands and when they have conquered they bring what they have gained in the war to the ft king Those also who are not soldiers but cultivate the ground and plough it and when after they have endured the labour and all the inconveniences of such works of husbandry  they have reaped and gathered in their fruits they bring trL butes to the king And whatsoever it is which the king says or commands it is done of necessity and that without any de lay while he in the mean time is satiated with all sorts Oi  food and pleasures and sleeps in quiet He is guarded by such as watch and such as are as it were fixed down to the place through fear for no one dares leave him even when he  is asleep nor does any one go away and take care of his own affairs but he esteems this one thing the only work of neces  sity to guard the king and accordingly to this he wholly  addicts himself How then can it be otherwise but that it must appear that the king exceeds all in strength while so great a multitude obeys his injunctions 5 Now when this man had held his peace the third of them who was Zorobabel began to instruct them about women and about truth who said thus  Wine is strong as is the king alsoj whom all men obey but women are superior to them in power for it was a woman that brought the king into the world and for those that plant the vines and make the wine  they are women who bear them and bring them up nor in 96 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XL deed is there any thing which we do not receive from them for these women weave garments for us and our household affairs are by their means taken care of and preserved in safety nor can we live separate from women And when we have gotten a great deal of gold and silver and any other thing that is of great value and deserving regard and see a beautiful woman we leave all these things and with open mouth fix our eyes upon her countenance and are willing to forsake what we have that we may enjoy her beauty and procure it to ourselves We also leave father and mother  and the earth that nourishes us and frequently forget our dearest friends for the sake of women nay we are so hardy as to lay down our lives for them But what will chiefly make you take notice of the strength of women is this that follows Do not we take pains and endure a great deal of trou ble and that both by land and sea and when we have pro cured somewhat as the fruit of our labours do we not bring them to the women as to our mistresses and bestow them upon them nay I once saw the king who is lord of so many people smitten on the face by Apame the daughter of Rabsases Themasius his concubine and his diadem taken away from him and put upon her own head while he bore it patiently and when she smiled he smiled and when she was angry he was sad and according to the change of her passions he flattered his wife and drew her to reconciliation by the great humiliation of himself to her if at any time he saw her displeased at him 6 And when the princes and rulers looked one upon another he began to speak about truth and he said I have already demonstrated how powerful women are but both these wo  men themselves and the king himself are weaker than truth for although the earth be large and the heaven high and the course of the sun swift yet are all these moved according to the will of God who is true and righteous for which cause we also ought to esteem truth to be strongest of all things and that what is unrighteous is of no force against it More over all things else that have any strength are mortal and short lived but truth is a thing that is immortal and eternal It affords us not indeed such a beauty as will wither away by time nor such riches as may be taken away by fortune but righteous rules and laws It distinguishes them from injustice and puts what is unrighteous to rebuke  The reader is to note that although the speeches or papers of these three of the king s guard are much the same in the third book of Esdias chap iii and iv as they are here in Josephus yet that the introduction of them is entirely different while in our Esdras the whole is related as the contrivance of the Chap III ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 97 7 So when Zorobabel had left off his discourse about truth and the multitude had cried out aloud that he had spoken the most wisely and that it was truth alone that had immutable strength and such as never would wax old the king commanded that he should ask for somewhat over and above what he had promised for that he would give it him because of his wisdom and that prudence wherein he exceeded the rest and thou shalt sit with me said the king and shalt be called my cousin When he had said this Zorobabel put him in mind of the vow he had made in case he should ever have the kingdom Now this vow was  to rebuild Jerusalem and to build therein the temple ot God as also to restore the vessels which Nebuchadnezzar had pillaged and carried to Babylon And this said he is that request which thou now permittest me to make on account that I have been judged to be wise and understanding 8 So the king was pleased with what he had said and arose and kissed him and wrote to the toparchs and governors and enjoined them to conduct Zorobabel and those that were going with him to build the temple He also sent letters to those rul ers that were in Syria and Phenicia to cut down and carry cedar trees from Lebanon to Jerusalem and to assist him in building the city He also wrote to them that all the captives who should go to Judea should be free and he prohibited his deputies and governors to lay any king s taxes upon the Jews he also per mitted that they should have all that land which they could pos sess themselves of without tributes He also enjoined the Idu means and Samaritans and the inhabitants of Celesyria to restore villages which they had taken from the Jews and that besides all this fifty talents should be given them for the building of the temple He also permitted them to offer their appointed sacri fices and that whatsoever the high priest and the priests wanted and those sacred garments wherein they used to worship God three of the king s guard themselves and even the mighty rewards are spo ken of as proposed by themselves and the speeches are related to have been delivered by themselves to the king in writing while all is contrary in Josephus I need not say whose account is the most probable the matters speak for them selves and there can be no doubt but Josephus history is here to be rery much preferred before the other Nor indeed does it seem to me at all unlikely that the whole was a contrivance of king Darius own in order to be decently and inoffen sively put in mind by Zorobabel of fulfilling his old vow for the rebuilding of Je rusalem and the temple and the restoration of the worship of the ONE TRUE GOD there Nor does the full meaning of Zorobabel when he cries out 3 Esdras iv 4O  Blessed be the God of truth and here  God is true and righteous or even of all the people 5 Esdras iv 41 Great is truth and mighty above all things seem to nw much different from this There is hut ONE TRUE GOD the God of Israel To which doctrine such as Cyrus and Darius c the Jews great patrons seem not to have been very averse though the entire idolatry of their kingdoms made them generally conceal it 98 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XL should be made at his own charges and that the musical instf u ments which the Levites used in singing hymns to God should be given them Moreover he charged them that portions of land should be given to those that guarded the city and the tem ple as also a determinate sum of money every year for their maintenance and withal he sent the vessels And all that Cy rus intended to do before him relating to the restoration of Je rusalem Darius also ordained should be done accordingly 9 Now when Zorobabel had obtained these grants from the king he went out of the palace and looking up to heaven he began to return thanks to God for the wisdom he had given him and the victory he had gained thereby even in the presence of Darius himself for said he I had not been thought worthy of these advantages O Lord unless thou hadst been favour able to me When therefore he had returned these thanks to God for the present circumstances he was in and had prayed to him to afford him the like favour for the time to come he came to Babylon and brought the good news to his countrymen of what grants he had procured for them from the king who when they heard the same gave thanks also to God that he restored the land of their forefathers to them again So they betook them selves to drinking and eating and for seven days they continued feasting and kept a festival for the rebuilding and restoration of their country after this they V se themselves rulers who should go up to Jerusalem out of i ribes of their forefathers with their wives and children and cattle who travelled to Je rusalem with joy and pleasure under the conduct of those whom Darius sent along with them and making a noise with songs and pipes and cymbals The rest of the Jewish multitude also besides accompanied them with rejoicing 10 And thus did these men go a certain and determinate num Â ber out of every family though I do not think it proper to re cite particularly the name of those families that I may not take off the mind of my readers from the connexion of the historical fects and make it hard for them to follow the coherence of my narrations but the sum of those that went up above the age of twelve years of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin was  four hundred sixty two myriads and eight thousand the Levites were seventy four  the number of the women and children mixed to gether was forty thousand seven hundred and forty two and be sides these there were singers of the Levites one hundred and  This strange reading in Josophns present copies of 4 OOO COO instead of 40 000 is one of the grossest errors that is in them and ought to be corrected from Ezra ii 64 1 Esd v 40 and Neb vii 66 who all agree the general sum was but about 42 360 It is also very plain that Josephus thought that when Esdras afterwards brought up another company out of Babylon and Persia in tlie IV ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 99 twenty eight and porters one hundred and ten and of the sacred ministers three hundred and ninetyrtwo there were also others besides these who said they were of the Israelites but were not able to show their genealogies six hundred and sixty two some there were also who were expelled out of the number and ho nour of the priests as having married wives whose genealogies they could not produce nor were they found in the genealogies of the Levites a nd priests they were about five hundred and twenty five the multitude also of servants that followed those that went up out of Jerusalem were seven thousand three hundred and thirty seven the singing men and singing women were two hun dred and forty five the camels were four hundred and thirty five  the beasts used to the yoke were five thousand five hundred and twenty five and the governors of all this multitude thus num bered were Zorobabel the son of Salathiel of the posterity of Da vid and of the tribe of Judah and Jeshua the son of Josedek the high priest and besides these there were Mordecai and Serebe us who were distinguished from the multitude and were rulers who also contributed a hundred pounds of gold and five thou sand of silver By this means therefore the priests and the Le vites and a certain part of the entire people of the Jews that were hi Babylon came and dwelt in Jerusalem but the rest of the multitude returned every one to their own countries CHAP IV JJow the temple was built while the Cutheans endeavoured in vain to obitruct the work Â 1 Now in the seventh month after they were departed put of Babylon both Jeshua the high priest and Zorobabel the governor sent messengers every way round about and ga thered those that were in the country together to Jerusalem uni versally who came very gladly thither He then built the altar on the same place it had formerly been built that they might of fer the appointed sacrifices upon it to God according to the laws of Moses But while they did this they did not please the neigh bouring nations who all of them bare an ill will to them They days of Xerxes they were also as well as these of the two tribes and out of them only and were in all no more than a seed and a remnant while an immense number of the ten tribes never returned but as he believed continued then beyond Eu phrates ch v sect 2 3 Of which multitude the Jews beyond Euphrates he speaks frequently elsewhere though by the way he never takes them to be idolaters but looks on them still as observers of the laws of Moses The certain part of the people that now came up from Babylon at the end of this chapter imply the samÂ smaller number of Jews that now cams up and will no way agree with the 4 000 00 VOL II N 17 TOO ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book also celebrated the feast of tabernacles at that time as the legis lator had ordained concerning it and after they offered sacrifices and what were called the daily sacrifices and the oblations pro pei for the Sabbaths and for all the holy festivals Those also vhat had made vows performed them and offered their sacrifices ironi the firsj day of the seventh month They also began to build the temple and gave a great deal of money to the masons and to the carpenter and what was necessary fer the maintenance of the workmen The Sidonians also were very willing and rea dy to bring the cedar trees from Libanus to bind them together and to make an united float of them and to bring them to the port of Joppa fop that was what Cyrus had commanded at first and what was now done at the command of Darius 2 In the second year of Â heir coming to Jerusalem as the Jews were there in the second month j the building of the temple went on apace and when they hat laid its foundations on the first day of the second month of that second year they set as overseers of the work such Levites as were full twenty years old and Je shua and his sons and brethren and Codmiel the brother of Ju das the son of Aminidab with his sons and the temple by the great diligence of those that had the care of it was finished sooner ebon any one weuld have expected And when the temple was finished the priests adorned with their accustomed garments stood with their trumpets while the Levites and the sons of Asaph stood and sung hymns to God according as David first of all appointed them to bless God Now the priests and Levites and thÂ elder part of the families recollecting with themselves how much greater and more sumptuous the old temple had been seeing that now made how much inferior it was on account of tfheir poveity to that whiclrhad been built of old considered with themselves how much their happy state was sunk below what it had been of old as well as their temple Hereupon they were disconsolate and not able to contain their grief and proceeded so far as to lament and shed tears on those accounts but the people rn general were contented with their present condition and be cause they were allowed to build them a temple they desired no more and neither regarded nor remembered nor indeed at all tormented themselves with the comparison of that and the former temple as if this were below their expectations but the wailing o die old men and of the priests on account of the deficiency o this temple in their opinion if compared with that which had been d emoli Â hed overcame the sounds of the trumpets and ijie rejoicing of the people 3 But when tht Samaritans who were still enemies to the tribes of Jmlah and Benjamin heard the sound of the trumpets they can Â wming together and desired to know what was thÂ Chap IV ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS occasion of this tumult and when they perceived that it was from the Jews who had been carried captive to Babylon and were re building their temple they came to Zorobabel and to Jeshua and to the heads of the families and desired that they would give them leave to build the temple with them and to be partners with them in building it for they said We worship your God and especially pray to him and are desirous of your religious settlement and this ever since Shalmaneser the king of Assy ria transplanted us out of Cuthah and Media to this place When they said thus Zorobabel and Jeshua the high priest and the heads of the families of the Israelites replied to them that it was impossible for them to permit them to be their partners while they only had been appointed to build that temple at first by Cyrus and now by Darius although it was indeed lawful for them to come ahd worship there if they pleased and that they could allow them nothing but that in common with them which was common to them with all other men to come to their temple and worship God there 4 WThen the Cutheans heard this for the Samaritans have that appellation â they had indignation at it and persuaded the nations of Syria to desire of the governors in the same manner as they had done formerly in the days of Cyrus and again in the days of Cambyses afterwards to put a stop to the building ot the temple and to endeavour to delay and protract the Jews iu their zeal about it Now at this time Sisinues the governer QI Syria and Phenicia and Sathrabuzanes with certain others jcame up to Jerusalem and asked the rulers of the Jews By  whose grant it was that they built the temple in this manner  since it was more like to a citadel than a temple and for what  reason it was that they built cloisters and walls and those strong ones too about the city To which Zorobabel and Jeshua the high priest replied that they were the servants ot God Almighty that this temple was built for him by Â Jung of theirs that lived in great prosperity and one that exceeded all men hi virtue and that it continued a long time but that because of their father s impiety towards God Nebuchadnez   zar king of the Babylonians and of the Chaldeans took their city by force and destroyed it and pillaged the temple and burnt U down and transplanted the people whom he had  made captives and removed them to Babylon that Cyrus  who aftejr him was king of Babylonia and Persia wrote to them to build the temple and committed the gifts and ves sels and whatsoever Nebuchadnezzar had carried out of it to Zorobabel and Mithridates the treasurer and gave order to have them carried to Jerusalem and to have them restored  to their own temple when it was built for he had sent to 102 ANTIQUITIES OP THE JEW Book XI them to have done speedily and commanded Sanabassar to go up to Jerusalem and to take care of the building of the temple who upon receiving that epistle from Cyrus came and immediately laid its foundations and although it hath  been in building from that time to this it hath not yet been finished by reason of the malignity of our enemies If there fore you have a mind and think it proper write this account to Darius that when he hath consulted the records of the kings he may find that we have told you nothing that is false about this matter 5 When Zorobabel and the high priest had made this answer Sisinnes and those that were with him did not resolve to hin der the building until they had informed king Darius of nil this So they immediately wrote to him about these affairs but as the Jews were now under terror and afraid lest the king should change his resolutions as to the building of Jeru salem and of the temple there were two prophets at that time among them Haggai and Zechariah who encouraged them and bid them be of good cheer and to suspect no discourage ment from the Persians for that God foretold this to them So in dependance on those prophets they applied themselves earnestly to building and did not intermit one day 6 Now Darius when the Samaritans had written to him and in their epistle had accused the Jews how they fortified the city and built the temple more like to a citadel than to a tem ple and said that their doings were not expedient for the king s affairs and besides they showed the epistle of Cambyses where in he forbade them to build the temple and when Darius there by understood that the restoration of Jerusalem was not expe dient for his affairs and when he had read the epistle that Was brought him from Sisinnes and those that were with him he gave order that what concerned these matters should be sought for among the royal records Whereupon a book was found at Ecbatana in the tower that was in Media wherein was writ ten as follows Cyrus the king in the first year of his reign commanded that the temple should be built in Jerusalem and the altar in height threescore cubits and its breadth of  the same with three edifices of polished stone and one edifice of stoneof their own country and he ordained that the expenses of it should be paid out of the king s revenue He also corfi  manded that the vessels which Nebuchadnezzar had pillaged out of the temple and had carried to Babylon should be restored to the people of Jerusalem and that the care of these  things should belong to Sanabassar the governor and president of Syria and Phenicia and to his associates that they may H not meddle with that place but may permit the servants of Chap IV ANTtgumfcS OF THk JEWS God the Jews and their rulers to build the tempfej He also ordained that they should assist them in the work and that they should pay to the Jews out of the tribute of the coun try where they were governors on account of the sacrifices bulls and rams and lambs and kids of the goats ahd fine flout and oil and wine and all other things that the priests should suggest to them and that they should pray for the preserva tion of the king and of the Persians and that for such as transgressed any of these orders thus sent to thÂ m he com manded that they should be caught and hung upon a cross and their substance confiscated to the king s use He also prayed to God against them that if any one attempted to hinder the building of the temple God would strike him dead and thereby restrain his wickedness 7 When Darius had found this book among the records of Cyrus he wrote an answer to Sisinnes and his associates whose contents were these  King Darius to Sisinnes the governor and to Sathrabuzanes sendeth greeting Having found a copy of this epistle among the records of Cyrus I have sent it you and I will that all things be done as is therein written Fare ye well So when Sisinnes and those that were with him understood the intention of the king they resolveS to follow his directions entirely for the time to come So they forwarded the sacred works and assisted the elders of the Jews and the princes of the sanhedrim ami the structure of the temple was with great diligence brought to a conclusion by the prophecies of Haggai and Zechariah according to God s commands and by the injunctions of Cyrus nml Darius the kings Now the temple was built in seven years time And in the ninth year of the reign of Darius on the twenty third day of the twelfth month which is by us called Adar but by the Macedonians Dystnts the priests and Levites and the other multitude of the Israelites offered sacrifices as the renovation of their former prosperity after their captivity find because they had now the temple re built a hundred bulls two hundred rams four hundred lambs and twelve kids of the goats according to the number of their tribes for so many are the tribes of the Israelites and this last for the sins of every tribe The priests also and the Levites set the porters at every gate according to the laws of Moses The Jews also built the cloisters of the inner temple that were round about the temple itself 8 And as the feast of unleavened bread was at hand in the first month which according to the Macedonians is called Xan thicus but according to us Nisan all the people ran together out of the villages to the city and celebrated the festival having purified themselves with their wires and children according 104 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XI  to the law of their country and they offered the sacrifice whidi was called the Passover on the fourteenth day of the same month and feasted seven days and spared for no cost but of fered whole burnt offerings to God and performed sacrifices ot thanksgiving because God had led them again to the land ot their fathers and to the laws thereto belonging and had ren dered the mind of the king of Persia favourable to them So these men offered the largest sacrifices on these accounts and used great magnificence in the worship of God and dwelt in Jerusalem and made use of a form of government that was aristocratical but mixed with an oligarchy for the high priests were at the head of their affairs until the posterity of the Asa moneans set up kingly government for before their captivity and the dissolution of their polity they at first had kingly government from Saul and Davidj for five hundred and thirty two years six months and ten days but before those kings such rulers governed them as were called Judges and Monarchs Under this form of government they continued for more than five hundred years after the death of Moses and of Joshua their commander And this is the account I had to give of the Jews who had been carried into captivity but were delivered from it in the times of Cyrus and Darius 9  But the Samaritans being evil and enviously disposed to the Jews wrought them many mischiefs by reliance on their riches and by their pretence that they were allied to the Per sians on account that thence they came and whatsoever it was that they were enjoined to pay the Jews by the king s order out of their tributes for the sacrifices they would not pay it They had also the governors favourable to them and assisting them for that purpose nor did they spare to hurt them either by themselves or by others as far as they were able So the Jews determined to send an embassage to king Darius in favour of the people of Jerusalem and in order to accuse the Samaritans The ambassadors were Zorobabel and four others of the rulers and as soon as the king knew from the ambassadors the accusa tions and complaints they brought against the Samaritans he gave them an epistle to be carried to the governors and council of Samaria The cpntents of which epistle were these  King Darius to Tanganas and Sambabas the governors of the Sa maritans to Sadraces and Bobelo and the rest of their fell ow servants that are in Samaria Zorobabel Ananias and Mor decai the ambassadors ofthe Jews complain of you that you obstruct them in the building of the temple and do not sup  The history contained in this

therefore is this that upon tl e reading of this epistle you supply them with whatso ever they want for their sacrifices and that out of the royal treasury of the tributes of Samaria as the priest shall desire that they may not leave off offering their daily sacrifices nor praying to God for me and the Persians And these were Ihe contents of that epistle   CHAP V Haw Xerxes the son of Darius leas well disposed to tJie Jews As also concerning Esdras and Nehemiah  1 LJPON the death of Darius Xerxes his son took the kingdom who as he inherited his father s kingdom so did he inherit his piety towards God and honour of him for he did all titings suitably to his father relating to divine worship and he was exceeding friendly to the Jews Now about this time a son of Jeshua whose name was Joacim was the high priest Moreover there was now in Babylon a righteous man and one that enjoyed a great reputation among the multitude He was the principal priest of the people and his name was Esdras He was very skilful in the laws of Moses and was well acquainted with king Xerxes He had determined to go up to Jerusalem and to take with him some of those Jews that were in Babylon and he desired that the king would give him an epistle to the governors of Syria by which they might know who he was Ac cordingly the king wrote the following epistle to those govern ors  Xerxes king of kings to Ezra the priest and reader of the divine law greeting I think it agreeable to that love which I bear to mankind to permit those of the Jewish nation that are so disposed as well as those of the priests and Levites that are in our kingdom to go together to Jerusalem Ac cordingly I have given command for that purpose and let every one that hath a mind go according as it hath seemed good to me and to my seven counsellors and this in order to their review of the affairs of Judea to see whether they be agreeable to the law of God Let them also take with them  those presents which I and my friends have vowed with all that silver and gold that is found in the country of the Babylonians as dedicated to God and let all this be carried to Jerusalem to God for sacrifices Let it also be lawful for thee and thy brethren to make as many vessels of silver and gold as thou pleasest Thou shalt also dedicate those holy vessels which have been piven thee and as many more 106 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XI as thou bast a mind to make and shall take the expenses out of the king s treasury I have moreover written to the trea surers of Syria and Phenicia that they take care of those af fairs that Esdras the priest and reader of the laws of God is sent about And that God may not be at all angry with me or with my children I grant all that is necessary for sa crifices to God according to the law as far as a hundred cori of wheat And I enjoin you not to lay any treacherous imposition or any tributes upon their priests or Levites or sacred singers or porters or sacred servants or scribes of the temple And do thou O Esdras appoint Judges according to the wisdom given thee of God and those such as understand the law that they may judge in all Syria and Phenicia and do thou instruct those also who are ignorant of it that if any one of thy countrymen transgress the law of God or that of the king he may be punished as not transgressing it out of ignorance but as one that knows it indeed but boldly de spises and contemns it and such may be punished by death or by paying fines Farewell 2 When Esdras had received this epistle he was very joyful and began to worship God and confessed that he had been the cause of the king s great favour to him and that for the same reason he gave all the thanks to God So he read the epistle at Babylon to those Jew s that were there but he kept the epistle it self and sent a copy of it to all those of his own nation that were in Media And when these Jews had understood what piety the king had towards God and what kindness he had for Esdras they were all greatly pleased nay many of them took their ef fects with them and came to Babylon as very desirous of going down to Jerusalem but then the entire body of the people of Is rael remained in that country wherefore there are but two tribes in Asin and Europe subject to the Romans while the ten tribes are beyond Euphrates till now and are an immense multitude ami not to be estimated by numbers Now there came agreat num ber of priests and Levites and porters and sacred singers and sacred servants to Esdras So he gathered those that were in the captivity together beyond Euphrates and stayed there three days and ordained a fast for them that they might make their prayers to God for their preservation that they might suffer no misfor tunes by the way either from their enemies or from any other ill accident for Esdras had said beforehand that he had told the king how God would preserve them and so he had not thought fit to request that he would send horsemen to conduct them So when they had finished their prayers they removed from Eu phrates on the twelfth day of the first month of the seventh year of the reign of Xerxes3 and they came to Jerusalem on the fifth Chap V ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 107 month of the same year Now Esdras presented the sacred mo ney of the treasurers who were of the family of the priests ol silver six hundred and fifty talents vessels of silver one hundred talents vessels of gold twenty talents vessels of brass that was  more precious than gold twelve talents by weight for these presents had been made by the king and his counsellors and by all the Israelites that stayed at Babylon So when Esdras had delivered these things to the priests he gave to God as the ap pointed sacrifices of whole burnt offerings twelve bulls on ac count of the common preservation of the people ninety rams and seventy two lambs twelve kids of the goats for the remis sion of sins He also delivered the king s epistle to the king s officers and to the governors of Celesyria and Phenicia and as they were under a necessity of doing what was enjoined by him they honoured our nation and were assistant to them in all their necessities 3 Now these things were truly done under the conduct of Es dras and he succeeded in them because God esteemed him wor thy of the success of his conduct on account of his goodness and righteousness But some time afterward there came some per sons to him and brought an accusation against certain of the multitude and of the priests and Levites who had transgressed their settlement and dissolved the laws of their country by marrying strange wives and had brought the family of the priests into contusion These persons desired him to support the laws lest God should take up a general anger against them all and reduce them to a calamitous condition again Here upon he rent his garment immediately out of grief and pulled off the hair off his head and beard and cast himself upon the ground because this crime had reached the principal men among the people and considering that if he should enjoin them to cast out their wives and the children they had by them he should not be hearkened to he continued lying upon the ground However all the better sort came running to him who also themselves wept and partook of the grief he was under for what had been done So Esdras rose up from the ground and stretched out his hands towards heaven and said that  he was ashamed to look towards it because of the sins which the people had committed while they had cast out of their memories what their fathers had undergone on account of their wickedness and he besought God who had saved a seed and a remnant out of the calamity and captivity they had been in and had restored them again to Jerusalem and to their own land and had obliged the kings of  Dr Hudson takes notice here that this kind of brass or copper or rather mix ture of gold and brass or copper was called aurickalcum and that this was of old esteemed the most precious of all metals VOL II o 19 108 ANTIQUITIES or THE JEWS Book XI Persia to have compassion on them that he would also for give them their sins they had now committed which though they deserved death yet it was agreeable to the mercy of God to remit even to these the punishment due to them 4 After Esdras had said this he left off praying and when all those that came to him with their wives and children were under lamentation one whose name was Jechonias a principal man in Jerusalem came to him and said that they had sinned in marrying strange wives and he persuaded him to adjure them all to cast those wives out and the children born of therav and that those should be punished who would not obey the law So Esdras hearkened to this advice and made the heads of the priests and of the Levites and of the Israelites swear that they would put away those wives and children according to the ad vice of Jechonias And when he had received their oaths he went in haste out of the temple into the chamber of Johanan the son of Eliasib and as he had hitherto tasted nothing at all for grief so he abode there that day And when proclamation was made that all those of the captivity should gather themselves to gether to Jerusalem and those that did not meet there in two or three days should be banished from the multitude and that their substance should be appropriated to the uses of the temple ac cording to the sentence of the elders those that were of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin came together in three days viz on the twentieth day of the ninth month which according to the He brews is called Tebeth and according to the Macedonians Apel leus Now as they were sitting in the upper room of the tem ple where the elders also were present but were uneasy because of the cold Esdras stood up and accused them and told them that they had sinned in marrying wives that were not of their own nation but that now they would do a thing both pleasing to God and advantageous to themselves if they would put those wives away Accordingly they all cried out that  they would do so That however the multitude was great and that the season of the year was winter and that this work would re quire more than one or two days Let their rulers therefore said they and those that have married strange wives come hither at a proper time while the elders of every place that are in common to estimate the number of those that have thus married are to be there also Accordingly this was resolv ed on by them and they began the inquiry after those that had married strange wives on the first day of the next month and continued the inquiry to the first day of the tenth month and found a great many of the posterity of Jeshua the high priest and of the priests and Levites and Israelites who had  a greater  This procedure of Ezra and of the best part of the Jewish nation after their return from the Babylonish captivity of reducing the Jewish marriages once for ail Chap V ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 109 regard to the observation of the law than to their natural af fection and immediately cast out their wives and the children which were born of them And in order to appease God they offered sacrifices and slew rams as oblations to him but it does not seem to me to be necessary to set down the names of these men So when Esdras had reformed this sin about the mar riages of the forementioned persons he reduced that practice to purity so that it continued in that state for the time to come 5 Now when they kept the  feast of tabernacles in the se venth month and almost all the people were come together to it they went up to the open part of the temple to the gate which looked eastward and desired of Esdras that the laws of Moses might be read to them Accordingly he stood in the midst of the multitude and read them and this he did from morning to noon Now by hearing the laws read to them they were in structed to be righteous men for the present and for the future but as for their past offences they were displeased at themselves and proceeded to shed tears on their account as considering with themselves that if they had kept the law they had endured none of these miseries which they had experienced But when Esdras saw them in that disposition he bade them go home and not weep for that it was a festival and that they ought not to weep there on for that it was f not lawful so to do He exhorted them ra ther to proceed immediately to feasting and to do what was suit able to a feast and what was agreeable to a day of joy but to let their repentance and sorrow for their former sins be a se curity and a guard to them that they fall no more into the like offences So upon Esdras exhortation they began to feast and when they had so done for eight days in their tabernacles they departed to their own homes singing hymns to God and returning thanks to Esdras for his reformation of what cor ruptions had been introduced into their settlement So it came w pass that after he had obtained this reputation among the to the strictness of the law of Moses without any regard to the greatness of those who had broken it and without regard to that natural affection or compassion for their heathen wives and their children hy them which made it so hard for Ezra to correct it deserves greatly to be observed and imitated in all attempts for reforma tion among Christians the contrary conduct having ever been the bane of true reli gion both among Jews and Christians while political views or human passions or prudential motives are suffered to take place instead of the divine laws and so the blessing of God is forfeited and the church still suffered to continue corrupt from one generation to another See chap viii sect 2  This Jewish feast of tabernacles was imitated in several hentben solemnities as Spanheim here observes and proves He also farther observes presently what great regard many heathens had to the monuments of their forefathers as Nehemiah had here sect 6 t This rule of Ezra s not to fast on a festival day is quoted in the Apostolical Constitutions B V as obtaining among Christians also HO ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XI people he died an old man and was buried in a magnificent manner at Jerusalem About the same time it happened also that Joachim the high priest died and his son Eliasib succeed ed in the high priesthood 6 Now there was one of those Jews that had been carried cap tive who was cup bearer to king Xerxes  his name was Nehe miah As this man was walking before Susa the metropolis of the Persians he heard some strangers that were entering the city after a long journey speaking to another in the Hebrew tongue so he went to them and asked them whence they came And when their answer was that they came from Judea he began to inquire of them again in what state the multitude was and in what condition Jerusalem was nnd when they replied that they were in a  bad state for that their walls were thrown down to the ground and that the neighbouring nations did a great deal o mischief to the Jews while in the day time they overran the country and pillaged it and in the night did them mischief in somuch that not a few were led away captive out of the country and out of Jerusalem itself and that the roads were in the day time found full of dead men Hereupon Nehemiah shed tears out of commiseration for the calamities of his countrymen and looking up to heaven he said  How long O Lord wilt thou overlook our nation while it suffers so great miseries and while we are made the prey and spoil of all men And while he stayed at the gate and lamented thus one told him that the king was go ing to sit down to supper so he made haste and went as he was without washing himself to minister to the king in his office o j cup bearer But as the king was very pleasant after supper and more cheerful than usual he cast his eyes on Nehemiah and seeing him look sad he asked him why he was sad Where upon he prayed to God to give him favour and afford him the power of persuading by his words and said How can I O king appear otherwise than thus and not be in trouble while I hear that the walls of Jerusalem the city where are the sepulchres of my fathers are thrown down to the ground and that its gates are consumed by fire but do thou grant me the favour to go and build its wall and to finish the building of the temple Accordingly the king gave him a signal that he freely granted him what he asked and told him that he should carry an epistle to the governors that they might pay him due honour and afford him whatsoever assistance he  This miserable condition of the Jews and their capital must have been after the death of Ezra their former governor and before Nehemiah came with his com mission to build the walls of Jerusalem Nor is that at all disagreeable to these his tories in Josephus since Ezra came on the 7th and Nehemiah not till the 25tb ot Xerxes at the interval of 18 years Chap V ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 1H wanted and as he pleased Leave off thy sorrow then said the king and be cheerful in the performance of thy office hereafter So Nehemiah worshipped God and gave the king thanks for his promise and cleared up his sad and cloudy countenance by the pleasure he had from the king s promises Accordingly the king called for him the next day and gave him an epistle to be carried to Adeus the governor of Syria and Phenicia and Samaria wherein he sent to him to pay due honour to Nehemiah and to supply him with what he wanted for his building 7 Now when he was come to Babylon and had taken with him many of his countrymen who voluntarily followed him he caÂ iÂ to Jerusalem in the twenty and fifth year of the reign of Xerxes And when he had shown the  epistles to God he gave them to Adeus and to the other governors He also called together all the people to Jerusalem and stood in the midst of the temple and made the following speech to them You know O Jews that God hath kept our fathers Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in mind continually and for the sake of their righteousness hath not left off the care of you Indeed he hath assisted me in gaining this authority of the king to raise up our wall and finish what is wanting of the temple I desire you therefore who well know the ill will our neighbouring nations bear to us and that when once they are made sensible that we are in earnest about building they will come upon us and contrive many ways of obstructing our works that you will in the first place put your trust in God as in him that will assist us against their hatred and to intermit building neither night nor day but to use all diligence and to hasten on the work now we have this especial opportunity for it When he had said this he gave order that the rulers should measure the wall and part the work of it among the people according to their vil lages and cities as every one s abilities should require And when he had added this promise that he himself with his ser vants would assist them he dissolved the assembly So the Jews prepared for the work That is the name they are called by from the day that they came up from Babylon which is taken from the tribe of Judah which came first to these places and thence both they and the country gained that appellation 8 But now when the Ammonites and Moabites

Havcvcamp til observes on this place 112 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XI ritans and all that inhabited Celesyria heard that the building went on apace they took it heinously and proceeded to lay snares for them and to hinder their intentions They also slew many of the Jews and sought how they might destroy Nehe miah himself by hiring some of the foreigners to kill him They also put the Jews in fear and disturbed them and spread abroad rumours as if many nations were ready to make an expedition against them by which means they were harassed and had almost left off the building But none of these things could deter Nehe miah from being diligent about the work he only set a number of men about him as a guard to his body and so unweariedly persevered therein and was insensible of any trouble out of his desire to perfect this work And thus did he attentively and with great forecast take care of his own safety not that he fear ed death but of this persuasion that if he were dead the walls for his citizens would never be raised He also gave orders that the builders should keep their ranks and have their armour on while they were building Accordingly the mason had his sword on as well as he that brought the materials for building He also appointed that their shields should lie very near them and he placed trumpeters at every five hundred feet and charged them that if their enemies appeared they should give notice of it to the people that they might fight in their armour and their enemies might not fall upon them naked He also went about the compass of the city by night being never discouraged nei  ther about the work itself nor about his own diet and sleep for he made no use of those things for his pleasure but out of ne cessity And this trouble he underwent for  two years and four months for in so long time was the wall built in the twenty eigth year of the reign of Xerxes in the ninth month Now when the walls were finished Nehemiah and the multitude offered sacrifices to God for the building of them and they con tinued in feasting eight days However when the nations which dwelt in Syria heard that the building of the wall was finished  It may not be very improper to remark here with what an unusual accuracy Josephus determines these years of Xerxes in which the walls of Jerusalem were built viz that Nehemiah came with his commission on the 25th of Xerxes that the walls were two years four months in building and that thuy were finished on the 28th of Xerxes sect 7 8 It may be also remarked farther that Josephus hardly ever mentions more than one infallible astronomical character I mean an eclipse of the moon and this a little before the death of Herod the Great Antiq B XVII ch vi sect 4 vol III Now on these two chronological characters in a great measure depend some of the most important points belonging to Christianity viz the expli cation of Daniel s 70 weeks and the duration of our Saviour s ministry and the time of his death in correspondence to those 70 weeks See the supplement to the Lit Accump of Proph page 7 Chap VI ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS  113 they had indignation at it But when Nehemiah saw that the city was thin of people he exhorted the priests and the Levites that they would leave the country and remove themselves to the city and there continue and he built them houses at his own expense and he commanded that part of the people which were employed in cultivating the land to bring the tithes ot their fruits to Jerusalem that the priests and Levites having whereof they might live perpetually and might not leave the divine worship  who willingly hearkened to the constitutions ot Nehemiah by which means the city Jerusalem came to be fuller of people than it was before So when Nehemiah had done many other excellent things and things worthy of commenda tion in a glorious manner he came to a great age and then died He was a man of a good and righteous disposition and very ambitious to make his own nation happy and he hath left the walls of Jerusalem as an eternal monument for himself Now this was done in the days of Xerxes CHAP VI Concerning Esther and Mordecai and Human  and how in the reign of

our learned and judicious Dr Wall in his late posthumous critical notes upon all the other Hebrew books of the Old Testament gives us none upon the Canticles or upon Esther and seems thereby to give up this book as well as he gives up the Canticles as indefensible 1 shall venture to say that almost all the objections against this book of Esther are gone at once if as we certainly ought to do and as Dean Prideaux has justly done we place this history under Artaxet xes Longimanus as doth both the Septuagint interpreters and Josephus The learned Dr Lee in his posthumous dissertation on the second book of Esdras page 25 also says That the truth of this history is demonstrated by the feast of Furini kept up from that time to this very day And this surprising providential revolu tion in favour of a captive people thereby constantly commemorated standeth even upon a firmer basis than that there ever was such a man as king Alexander the 11 Great in the world of whose reign there is no such abiding monument at this djiy to be found any where Nor will they I dare say who quarrel at this or any other of the sacred histories find it a very easy matter to reconcile the different accounts which were given by historians of the affairs of this king or to confirm any one fact of his whatever with the same evidence which is here given for the principal fact in the sacred book or even so much as to prove the existence of such a person of whom so creat things are related but upon granting this book of Esther or sixth of Esdras as it is placed in some of the most ancient copies of the Vulgate to be a most true and certain history c 114 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XL children were in danger of perishing the occasion whereof we shall declare in a little time for it is proper in the first place to explain somewhat relating to this king and how he came to marry a Jewish wife who was herself of the royal family also and who is related to have saved our nation for when Artax erxes had taken the kingdom and had set governors over the hundred and twenty and seven provinces from India even unto Ethiopia in the third year of his reign he made a costly feast for his friends and for the nations of Persia and for their governors such an one as was proper for a king to make when he had a mind to make a public demonstration of his riches and this for a hundred and fourscore days after which he made a feast for other nations and for their ambassadors at Shushan for seven days Now this feast was ordered after the manner following he caused a tent to be pitched which was supported by pillars of gold and silver with curtains of linen and purple spread over them that it might afford room for many ten thou sands to sit down The cups with which the waiters ministered were of gold and adorned with precious stones for pleasure and for sight He also gave order to the servants that they should  not force them to drink by bringing them wine continually as is the practice of the Persians but to permit every one of the guests to enjoy himself according to his own inclination Moreover he sent messengers through the country and gave or der that they should have a remission of their labours and should keep a festival many days on account of his kingdom In like manner did Vashti the queen gather her guests together and made them a feast in the palace Now the king was desirous to show her who exceeded all other women in beauty to those that feasted with him and he sent some to command her to come to his feast But she out of regard to the laws of the Persians which  forbid the wives to be seen by strangers did not go to the king and though he oftentimes sent the eunuchs to her she did nevertheless stay away and refused to come till the king was so much irritated that he broke up the entertainment and  If the Cbaldee paraphrase be in the right that Artaxerxes intended to show Vashti to his guests naked it is no wonder at all that she would not submit to such an indignity  but still if it were not so gross as that yet it might in the king s cups be done in a way so indecent as the Persian laws would not then bear no more than the common laws of modesty And that the king had some such design seems Hot improbable for otherwise the principal of these royal guests could be no strangers to the queen nor unapprized of hÂ r beauty so far as decency admitted However Â ince Providence was now paving the way for the introduction of a Jewess into the king s affections in order to bring about one of the most wonderful deliverances which the Jewish or any nation ever had we need not be farther solicitous about the motives by which the king was induced to divorce V ishti and marry Esther Chap VI ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 115 rose up and called for those seven who had the interpretation of the laws committed to them and accused his wife and said that he had been affronted by her because that when she was frequently called by him to his feast she did not obey him once He therefore gave order that they should inform him what could be done by the law against her So one of them whose name was Memucan said That this affront was offered not to him alone but to all the Persians who were in danger of leading their lives very ill with their wives if they must be thus des pised by them for that none of their wives would have any reverence for their husbands if they had such an example of arrogance in the queen towards thee who rulest over all Accordingly he exhorted him to punish her who had been guilty of so great an affront to him after a severe manner and when he had so done to publish to the nations what had been decreed about the queen So the resolution was to put Vashti away and to give her digniiy to another woman 2 But the king having been fond of her did not well bear a separation and yet by the law he could not admit of a reconci liation so he was under trouble as not having it in his power to do what he desired to do But when his friends saw him so uneasy they advised him to cast the memory of his wife and his love for her out of his mind but to send abroad over all the habitable earth and to search out for comely virgins and to take her whom he should like best for a wife because his pas sion for his former wife would be quenched by the introduction of another and the kindness he had to Vashti would be with drawn from her and be placed on her that was with him Ac cordingly he was persuaded to follow this advice and gave or der to certain persons to choose out of the virgins that were in his kingdom those that were esteemed the most comely So when a great number of these virgins were gathered together there was found a damsel in Babylon both whose parents were dead and she was brought up with her uncle Mordecai for that was her uncle s name This uncle was of the tribe of Benjamin and was one of the principal persons among the Jews Now it proved that this damsel whose name was Esther was the most beau tiful of all the rest and that the grace of her countenance drew the eyes of the spectators principally upon her So she was com mitted to one of the eunuchs to take the care of her and she was very exactly provided with sweet odours in great plenty and with costly ointments such as her body required to be anointed withal and this was used for six months by the vir gins who were in number four hundred And when the eu nuch thought the virgins had been sufficiently purified in the forementioned time and were now fit to go to the king s bed VOL u p 19 116 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XL he sent one to be with the king every day So when he had ac companied with her he sent her back to the eunuch and when Esther had come to him he was pleased with her and fell in love with the damsel and married her and made her his lawful wife and kept a wedding feast for her on the twelfth month of the seventh year of his reign which was called Adar He also sent angari as they are called or messengers unto every nation and gave orders that they should keep a feast for his marriage while he himself treated the Persians and the Medes and the principal men of the nations for a whole month on account of this his marriage Accordingly Esther came to his royal palace and he set a diadem on her head And thus was Esther married without making known to the king what na tion she was derived from Her uncle also removed from Ba bylon to Shushan and dwelt there being every day about the palace and inquiring how the damsel did for he loved her as thougjh she had been his own daughter 3 Now the king had made  a law that none of his own people should approach him unless he were called when he sat upon his throne men with axes in their hands stood round about his throne in order to punish such as approached to him without being called However the king sat with a golden sceptre in his hand which he held out when he had a mind to save any one of those that approached to him without being call ed and he who touched it was free from danger But of this matter we have discoursed sufficiently 4 Some time after this two eunuchs Bigthan and Teresh plotted against the king and Barnabazus the servant of one of the ennuchs being by birth a Jew was acquainted with their conspiracy and discovered it to the queen s uncle and Mor decai by the means of Esther made the conspirators known to the king This troubled the king but he discovered the truth and hanged the eunuchs upon a cross while at that time he gave no reward to Mordecai who had been the occasion of his preser vation He only bid the scribes to set down his name in the records and bid him stay in the palace as an intimate friend of the king s 5 Now there was one Haman the son of Amedatha by birth an Amalekite that used to go in to the king and the foreigners and Persians worshipped him as Artaxerxes had commanded  Herodotus says that this law against any one s coming uncalled to the kings of Persia when they were sitting on their thrones was first enacted by Deioces i e by him who first withdrew tliu Medes from the dominion of the Assyrians and himself first reigned over them Thus also says Spanheim stood guards with their axes about the throne of Tenus Tenudus that the offender might by them be punished immediately Chap VI ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 117 that such honour should be paid to him but Mordecai was so wise and so observant of his own country s laws that he would not  worship the man When Haman observed this he in quired whence he came and when he understood that he was a Jew he had indignation at him and said within himself That whereas the Persians who were free men worshipped him this man who was no better than a slave does not vouchsafe to do so And when he desired to punish Mordecai he thought it too small a thing to request of the king that he alone might be punished he rather determined to abolish the whole nation for he was naturally an enemy to the Jews because the nation of the Amalekites of which he was had been destroyed by them Accordingly he came to the king and accused them saying There is a certain wicked nation and it is dispersed over all the habitable earth that is under thy dominion a nation se parate from others unsociable neither admitting the same sort of divine worship that others do nor using laws like to the laws of others at enmity with thy people and with all men both in their manners and practices Now if thou wilt be a benefactor to thy subjects thou wilt give order to destroy them utterly and not leave the least remains of them nor preserve any of them either for slaves or for captives But that the king might not be damnified by the loss of the tributes which the Jews paid him Hainan promised to give him out of his own estate forty thousand talents whensoever he pleased and he said he would pay this money very willingly that the king dom might be freed from such a misfortune 6 When Haman had made this petition the king both for gave him the money and granted him the men to do what he would with them So Haman having gained what he desired sent out immediately a decree as from the king to all nations the contents whereof were these Artaxerxes the great king to the rulers of the hundred twenty and seven provinces from India to Ethiopia sends this writing Whereas I have go verned many nations and obtained the dominions of all the habitable earth according to my desire and have not been obliged to do any thing that is insolent or cruel to my subjects by such my power but have showed myself mild and gentle by taking care of their peace and good order and have sought  Whether this adoration required of Mordecai to Haman were by him deemed too like the adoration due only to God as Josehpus seems here to think as well as the Septuagint interpreters also by their translation of Esth siii 12 IS 14 or whether he thought he ought to pay no sort of adoration to an Amalekite which nation had been such great sinners as to have been universally devoted to de struction by God himself Exocl xvii 14 15 16 2 Sam xv 18 or whether botf causes concurred cannot now I doubt be certainlv determined 118 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XI  how thej might enjoy those blessings for all time to come u And whereas I have been kindly informed by Haman who on account of his prudence and justice is the first in my esteem and in dignity and only second to myself for his fidelity and constant good will to me that there is an ill natured nation in termixed with all mankind that is averse to our laws and not subject to kings and of a different conduct of life from others that hateth monarchy and of a disposition that is per nicious to our affairs I give order that all these men of whom Haman our second father hath informed us be destroyed with their wives and children and that none of them be spared and that none prefer pity to them before obedience to this de cree And this I will to be executed on the fourteenth day of the twelfth month of the present year that so when all that have enmity to us are destroyed and this in one day we may be allowed to lead the rest of our lives in peace hereafter Now when this decree was brought to the cities and to the country all were ready for the destruction and entire abolish ment of the Jews against the day before mentioned and they were very hasty about it at Shushan in particular Accord ingly the king and Haman spent their time in feasting together with good cheer and wine but the city was in disorder 7 Now when Mordecai was informed of what was done he rent his clothes and put on sackcloth and sprinkled ashes upon his head and went about the city crying out That a nation that had been injurious to no man was to be destroyed And he went on saying thus as far as to the king s palace and there he stood for it was not lawful for him to go into it in that ha bit The same thing was done by all the Jews that were in the several cities wherein this decree was published with lamenta tion and mourning on account of the calamities denounced against them But as soon as certain persons had told the queen that Mordecai stood before the court in a mourning habit she was disturbed at this report and sent out such as should change his garments but when he could not be induced to put off his sackcloth because the sad occasion that forced him to put it on was not yet ceased she called the eunuch Acratheus for he was then present and sent him to Mordecai in order to know of him what sad accident had befallen him for which he was in mourning and would not put off the habit he had put on at her desire Then did Mordecai inform the eunuch of the occasion of his mourning and of the decree which was sent by the king into all the country and of the promise of money whereby Ha man bought the destruction of their nation He also gave him a copy of what was proclaimed at Shushan to be carried to Est her and he charged her to petition the king about this matter Chap VI ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 119 and not to think it a dishonourable thing in her to put on a humble habit for the safety of her nation wherein she might deprecate the ruin of the Jews who were in danger of it for that Haman whose dignity was only inferior to that of the king s had accused the Jews and had irritated the king against them When she was informed of this she sent to Mordecai again and told him that she was not called by the king and that he who goes in to him without being called is to be slain unless when he is willing to save any one he holds out his golden scep tre to him but that to whomsoever he does so although he go in without being called that person is so far from being slain that he obtains pardon and is entirely preserved Now when the eunuch carried this message from Esther to Mordecai he bade him also tell her that she must not only provide for her own preservation but for the common preservation of her nation for that if she now neglected this opportunity there would certainly arise help to them from God some other way but she and her father s house would be destroyed by those whom she now de spised But Esther sent the very same eunuch back to Mor decai to desire him to go to Shushan and to gather the Jews that were there together to a congregation and to fast and ab stain from all sorts of food on her account and to let him know that she with her maidens would do the same and then she promised that she would go to the king though it were against the law and that if she must die for it she would not refuse it 8 Accordingly Mordecai did as Esther had enjoined him and made the people fast and he besought God together with them  Not to overlook his nation particularly at this time when it was going to be destroyed but that as he had often before provided for them and forgiven when they had sinned so he would now deliver them from that destruction which was denounced against them for although it was not all the nation that had offended yet must they so ingloriously be slain and that he was himself the occasion of the wrath of Haman be cause said he I did not worship him nor could I endure to pay that honour to him which I used to pay to thee O Lord for upon that his anger hath he contrived this present mis chief against those that have not transgressed thy laws The same supplications did the multitude put up and entreated that God would provide for their deliverance and free the Israelites that were in all the eaith from this calamity which was now coming upon them for they had it before their eyes and ex pected its coming Accordingly Esther made supplication to God after the manner of her country by casting herself down upon the earth and putting on her mourning garments and bid ding farewell to meat and drink and all delicacies for three days 120 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XL time and she entreated God to have mercy upon her and make her words appear persuasive to the king and render her counte nance more beautiful than it was before that both by her words and beauty she might succeed for the averting of the king s an ger in case he were at all irritated against her and for the con solation of those of her own country now they were in the ut most danger of perishing as also that he would excite a hatred in the king against the enemies of the Jews and those that had contrived their future destruction if they be proved to be con temned by him 9 When Esther had used this supplication for three days she put off those garments changed her habit and adorned herself as became a queen and took two of her hand maids with her the one of which supported her as she gently leaned upon her and the other followed after and lifted up her large train which swept along the ground with the extremities of her fingers And thus she came to the king having a blushing red ness in her countenance with a pleasant agreeableness in her be haviour yet did she go in to him with fear and as soon as she was come over against him as he was sitting on his throne in his royal apparel which was a garment interwoven with gold and precious stones which made him seem to her more terrible especially when he looked at her somewhat severely and with a countenance on fire with anger her joints failed her immediate ly out of the dread she was in and she fell down sideways in a swoon but the king changed his mind which happened as I suppose by the will of God and was concerned for his wife lest her fear should bring some very ill thing upon her and he leaped from his throne and took her in his arms and recovered her by embracing her and speaking comfortably to her and exhorting her to be of good cheer and not to suspect any thing that was said on account of her coming to him without being called because that law was made for subjects but that she who was a queen as well as he a king might be entirely se cure  and as he said this he put the sceptre into her hand and laid his rod upon her neck on account of the law and so freed her from her fear And after she had recovered herself by these encouragements she said My lord it is not easy for me on the sudden to say what hath happened for as soon as I saw thee to be great and comely and terrible my spirit departed from me and I had no soul left in me And while it was with difficulty and in a low voice that she could say thus much the king was in a great agony and disorder and encou raged Esther to be of good cheer and to expect better fortune since he was ready if occasion should require it to grant to her the half of his kingdom Accordingly Esther desired that he Chap VI ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 121 and his friend Haman would come to her to a banquet for she said she had prepared a supper for him He consented to it and when they were there as they were drinking he bid Esther to  let him know what she desired for that she should not be disappointed though she should desire the half of his king dom But she put off the discovery of her petition till the next day if he would come again together with Haman to her banquet 10 Now when the king had promised so to do Haman went away very glad because he alone had the honour of supping with the king at Esther s banquet and because no one else partook of the same honour with kings but himself yet when he saw Mordecai in the court he was very much displeased for he paid him no manner of respect when he saw him So he went home and called for his wife Zeresh and his friends and when they were come he showed them what honour he enjoyed not only from the king but from the queen also for as he alone had that day supped with her together with the king so was he also in vited again for the next day yet said he am I not pleased to see Mordecai the Jew in the court Hereupon his wife Zeresh advised him to give order that a gallows should be made fifty cubits high and that in the morning he should ask it of the king that Mordecai might be hanged thereon So he commended her advice and gave order to his servants to prepare the gallows and to place it in the court for the punishment of Mordecai thereon which was accordingly prepared But God laughed to scorn the wicked expectations of Haman  and as he knew what the event would be was delighted at it for that night he took away the king s sleep and as the king was not willing to lose the time of his lying awake but to spend it in something that might be of advantage to his kingdom he commanded the scribe to bring him the chronicles of the former kings and the records of his own actions and when he had brought them and was reading them one was found to have received a country on account of his ex cellent management on a certain occasion and the name of the country was set down another was found to have had a present made him on account of his fidelity then the scribe came to Big than and Teresh the eunuchs that had made a conspiracy against the king which Mordecai had discovered and when the scribe said no more but that and was going on to another history the king stopped him and inquired  Whether it was not added that Mordecai had a reward given him and when he said there was no such addition he bid him leave off and he inquired of those that were appointed for that purpose what hour of the night it was and when he was informed that it was already day he gave order that if they found any one of his friends al 122 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XI ready come and standing before the court they should tell him Now it happened that Raman was found there for he was come sooner than ordinary to petition the king to have Mordecai put to death and when the servants said that Haman was before the court he Lid them call him in and when he was come in he said  Because I know that thou art my only fast friend I de sire thee to give me advice how I may honour one that I greatly love and that after a manner suitable to my magnifi cence Now Haman reasoned with himself that what opi nion he should give it would be for himself since it was he alone who was beloved by the king so he gave that advice which he thought of all other the best for he said If thou wouldest truly honour a man whom thou sayest thou dost love give order that he may ride on horseback with the same gar ment on which thou wearest and with a gold chain about his neck and let one of thy intimate friends go before him and proclaim through the whole city that whosoever the king honoureth obtaineth this mark of his honour This was the advice which Haman gave out of a supposal that such a reward would come to himself Hereupon the king was pleased with the advice and said Go thou therefore for thou hast the horse the garment and the chain ask for Mordecai the Jew and give him those things and go before his horse and pro claim accordingly for thou art said he my intimate friend and hast given me good advice be thou then the minister of  what thou hast advised me to This shall be his reward from us for preserving my life When he heard this order which was entirely unexpected he was confounded in his mind and knew not what to do However he went out and led the horse and took the purple garment and the golden chain for the neck and finding Mordecai before the court clothed in sackcloth he bid him put that garment off and put the purple garment on Â But Mordecai not knowing the truth of the matter but think ing that it was done in mockery said O thou wretch the vilest of all mankind dost thou thus laugh at our calamities But when he was satisfied that the king bestowed this honour up on him for the deliverance he had procured him when he con victed the eunuchs who had conspired against him he put on that purple garment which the king always wore and put the chain about his neck and got on horseback and went round the city while Haman went before and proclaimed This shall be the reward which the king will bestow on every one whom he loves and esteems worthy of honour And when they had gone round the city Mordecai went in to the king but Haman went home out of shame and informed his wife and friends of what had happened and this with tears who said that he would Chajl Vf ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 12S  be able to be revenged of Mordecai for that God was with him II Now while these men were thus talking one to another Esther s eunuchs hastened Haman away to come to supper but one of the eunuchs named Sabuchadas saw the gallows that was fixed in Haman s house and inquired of one of his servants for what purpose they had prepared it So he knew that it was for the queen s uncle because Haman was about to petition the king that he might be punished but at present he held his peace Now when the king with Haman were at the banquet he de sired the queen to tell him what gift she desired to obtain and assured her that she should have whatsoever she had a mind to She then lamented the danger her people were in and said that she and her nation were given up to be destroyed and that she on that account made this her petition that she would not have troubled him if he had only given order that they should be sold into bitter servitude for such a misfortune would not have been intolerable but she desired that they might be delivered from such a destruction And when the king inquired of her who was the author of this misery to them she then openly accused Haman and convicted him that he had been the wicked instrument of this and had formed his plot against them When the king was hereupon in disorder and was gone hastily out of the banquet into the gardens Ha man began to intercede with Esther and to beseech her to for give him as to what he had offended for he perceived that he was in a very bad case And as he had fallen upon the queen s bed and was making supplication to her the king came in and being still more provoked at what he saw O thou wretch said he thou vilest of all mankind dost thou aim to force my wife And when Haman was astonished at this and not able to speak one word more Sabuchadas the eunuch came in and accused Haman and said  He found a gallows at his house prepared for Mordecai for that the servant told him so much upon his inquiry when he was sent to him to call him to supper He said farther that the gallows was fifty cubits high Which when the king heard he determined that Haman should be punished after no other manner than that which had been devised by him against Mordecai so he gave order immediately that he should be hung upon this gallows and be put to death after that manner And from hence I can not forbear to admire God and to learn hence his wisdom and his justice not only in punishing the wickedness of Haman but in so disposing it that Ire should undergo the very same punishment which he had contrived for another as also be cause he thereby teaches others this lesson that what mischiefs VOL II g 19 121 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XT any one prepares against another he without knowing of it first contrives it against himself 12 Wherefore Haman who had immoderately abused the ho nour he had from the king was destroyed after this manner and the king granted his estate to the queen He also called for Mor decai for Esther had informed him that she was akin to him and gave that ring to Mordecai which he had before given to Haman The queen also gave Haman s estate to Mordecai and prayed the king to deliver the nation of the Jews from the fear of death and showed him what had been written over all the country by Haman the son of Ammedatha for that if her country were destroyed and her countrymen were to perish she could not bear to live herself any longer So the king promised her that he could not do any thing that should be disagreeable to her nor contradict what she desired but he bid her write what she pleased about the Jews in the king s name and seal it with his seal and send it to all his kingdom for that those who read epistles whose authority is secured by having the king s seal to them would no way contradict what was written therein So he commanded the king s scribes to be sent for and to write to the nations on the Jews behalf and to his lieutenants and governors that were over his hundred twen ty and seven provinces from India to Ethiopia Now the con tents of this epistle were these  The great king Artaxerxes to our rulers and those that are our faithful subjects sendeth greeting many men there are who on account of the great a ness of the benefits bestowed on them and because of the ho nour which they have obtained from the wonderful kind treat ment of those that bestowed it are not only injurious to their inferiors but do not scruple to do evil to those that have been their benefactors as if they would take away gratitude from among men and by their insolent abuse of such benefits as they never expected they turn the abundance they have against those that are the authors of it and suppose they shall lie con cealed from God in that case and avoid that vengeance which comes from him Some of these men when they have had the management of affairs committed to them by their friends and bearing private malice of their own against some others by deceiving those that have the power persuade them to be angry at such as have done them no harm till they are in  The true reason why king Artaxerxes did not here properly revoke his former barbarous decree for the universal slaughter of the Jews but only empowered and encouraged the Jews to fight for their lives to kill their enemies if they attempted their destruction seems to have been that old law of the Mules and Persians nut yet laid aside that whatever decree was signed both by the king and his lords could not be changed but remained unalterable Daniel vi 7 8 9 12 15 17 Esther i 19 and viii 8 And Haman having engrossed the royal favour might perhaps have himself signed this decree for the Jews slaughter instead of the anciiut lords and so might have rendered it by their rules irrevocable Chap VI ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 125 danger of perishing and this by laying accusations and calum  nies Nor is this state of things to be discovered by ancient examples or such as we have learned by report only but by some examples of such impudent attempts under our own eyes so that it is not fit to attend any longer to calumnies and accu sations nor to the persuasions of others but to determine what any one knows of himself to have been really done and to punish what justly deserves it and to grant favours to such as are innocent This hath been the case of Haman the son of Ammedatha by birth an Amalekite and alien from the blood of the Persians who when he was hospitably entertained by us and partook of that kindness which we bear to all men to so great a degree as to be called my father and to be all alone worshipped and to have honour paid him by all in the second rank after the royal honour due to ourselves he could not bear his good fortune nor govern the magnitude of his pros perity with sound reason nay he made a conspiracy against me and my life who gave him his authority by endeavouring to take away Mordecai my benefactor andmy saviour and by base ly and treacherously requiring to have Esther the partner of my life and of my dominion brought to destruction for he contri ved by this means to  deprive me of my faithful friends and transfer the government to others But since I perceived that these Jews that were by this pernicious fellow devoted to de struction were not wicked men but conducted their lives af ter the best manner and were men dedicated to the worship of that God who hath preserved the kingdom to me and to my ancestors I do not only free them from the punishment which the former epistle which was sent by Haman ordered to be inflicted on them to which if you refuse obedience you shall do well but I will that they have all honour paid to them Ac cordingly I have hanged up the man that contrived such things against them with his family before the gates of Shushan that punishment being sent upon him by God who seeth all things And I give you in charge that you publicly propose a copy of this epistle through all my kingdom that the Jews may be permitted peaceably to use their own laws and that  These words give an intimation as if Artaxerxes suspected a deeper design in Haman than openly appeared viz That knowing the Jews would be faithful to him and that he could never transfer the crown to his own family who was an Agagite Esth iii 1 10 or of the posterity of A gag the old king of the Amalekites 1 Sam xv 8 32 33 while they were olive and spread over all his dominions he there fore endeavoured to destroy them Nor is it to me improbable that those 73 800 of the Jews enemies which were soon destroyed by the Jews on the permission of the king which must be on some great occasion were Amalekites their old and hereditary enemies Exod xvii 14 15 and that thereby was fulfilled Balaam prophecy Amalek was the first of the nations but his Utter end shall be that he perish for ever Num xxiv 20 126 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XI you assist them that at the same season whereto their miser able estate did belong they may defend themselves the Tery Â same day from unjust violence the thirteenth day of the twelfth month which is Adar for God hath made that day a  day of salvation instead of a day of destruction to them and may it be a good day to those that wish us well and a memo  rial of the punishment of the conspirators against us and I will that you take notice that every city and every nation f that shall disobey any thing that is contained in this epistle shall be destroyed by fire and sword However let this f epistle be published through all the country that is under our f obedience and let all the Jews by all means be ready against  the day before mentioned that they may avenge themselves  upon their enemies 13 Accordingly the horsemen who carried the epistles pro ceeded on the ways which they were to go with speed but as for Mordecai as soon as he had assumed the royal garment and the crown of gold and had put the chain about his neck he went forth in a public procession and when the Jews who are at Shushan saw him in so great honour with the king they thought his good fortune was common to themselves also and joy and a beam of salvation encompassed the Jews both those that were in the cities and those that were in the countries upon the publi cation of the king s letters insomuch that many even of other nations circumcised their foreskin for fear of the Jews that they might procure safety to themselves thereby for on the thir teenth day of the twelfth month which according to the Hebrews is called Adar but according to the Macedonians Dystrus those that carried the king s epistle gave them notice that the same day wherein their danger was to have been on that very day should they destroy their enemies But now the rulers of the provinces and the tyrants and the kings and the scribes had the Jews in esteem for the fear they were in of Mordecai forced them to act with discretion Now when the royal decree was come to all the country that was subject to the king it fell out that the Jews at Shushan slew five hundred of their enemies and when the king had told Esther the number of those that were slain in that city but did not well know what had been done in the provinces he asked her whether she would have any thing farther done against them  for that it should be done according ly Upon which she desired that the Jews might be permitted to treat their remaining enemies in the same manner the next day as also that they might hang ten sons of Haman upon the gallows So the king permitted the Jews so to do as desirous not to contradict Esther So they gathered themselves together again on the fourteenth day of the month Dystrus and slew about three hundred of their enemies but touched nothing of what CLap VII ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 12 riches they had Now there was slain by the Jews that were in the country and in the other cities seventy five thousand of their enemies and these were slain on the thirteenth day of the month and the next day they kept as a festival In like manner the Jews that were in Shushan gathered themselves together and feasted on the fourteenth day and that which followed it whence it is that even now all the Jews that are in the hab itable earth keep these days festival and send portions to one another Mordecai also wrote to those Jews that lived in the kingdom of Artaxerxes to observe these days and celebrate them as festivals and to deliver them down to posterity that this festi val might continue for all time to come and that it might never be buried in oblivion for since they were about to be destroy ed on these days by Haman they would do a right thing upon escaping the danger in them and on them inflicting punishments on their enemies to observe those days and give thanks to God on them for which cause the Jews still keep the foremention ed days and call them  days of Phurim or Purim And Mordecai became a great and illustrious person with the king and assisted him in the government of the people He also lived with the queen so that the affairs of the Jews were by their means better than they could ever have hoped for And this was the state of the Jews under the reign of Artaxerxes f CHAP VII How John slew his brother Jesus in the temple and how Bagoses offered many injuries to the Jews and what Sanballat did j 1 WHEN Eliashab the high

as in the Hebrew than which emendation says he nothing is more certain And had we any assurance that Josephus copy mentioned the casting af lots as our other copies do Esth iii 7 I should fully agree with Reland but as it now stands it seems to me by no means certain f As to this whole book of Esther in the present Hebrew copy it is so very im perfect in a case where the providence of God was so very remarkable and the Septuagint and Josephus have so much of religion that it has not so much as the name of God once in it and it is hard to say who made that epitome which the Masorites have given us for the genuine book itself no religious Jews could well be the authors of it whose education obliged them to have a constant regard to God and whatsoever related to his worship nor do we know that there ever was so im perfect a copy of it in the world till after the day of Barchocab in the second century 128 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XI that Bagoses the general of  another Artaxerxes army polluted the temple and imposed tributes on the Jews that out of the public stock before they offered the daily sacrifices they should pay for every lamb fifty shekels Now Jesus was the brother of John and was a friend of Bagoses who had promised to procure him the high priesthood In confidence of whose sup port Jesus quarrelled with John in the temple and so provoked his brother that in his anger his brother slew him Now it was a horrible thing for John when he was high priest to perpe trate so great a crime and so much the more horrible that there never was so cruel and impious a thing done neither by the Greeks nor Barbarians However God did not neglect its punishment but the people were on that very account enslaved and the temple was polluted by the Persians Now when Ba goses the general of Artaxerxes army knew that John the high priest of the Jews had slain his own brother Jesus in th e temple he came upon the Jews immediately and began in anger to say to them Have you had the impudence to perpetrate a  murder in your temple And as he was aiming to go into the temple they forbade him so to do but he said to them Am not I purer than he that was slain in the temple And when he had said these words he went into the temple Ac cordingly Bagoses made use of this pretence and punished the Jews seven years for the murder of Jesus 2 Now when John had departed this life his son Jaddua suc ceeded in the high priesthood He had a brother whose name was Manasseh Now there was one Sanballat who was sent by Darius the last king of Persia into Samaria He was a Cuthean by birth of which stock were the Samaritans also This man knew that the city Jerusalem was a famous city and that their kings had given a great deal of trouble to the Assyrians and the people ot Celesyria so that he willingly gave his daugh  Concerning this other Artaxerxes called Mnemon and the Persian afflictiwi and captivity of the Jews under him occasioned by the murder of the

last king Darius who was conquered by Alex the Great I shall give them Vossius and Dr Hudson s answer though ii own word viz That Josephus did not do ill in omitting those kings of 1  with whom the Jews had no concern because he was giving the history of the Jews and not of the Persians which is a sufficient reason also why he entirely omits the history and the book of Job as not particularly relating to that nation He justly therefore returns to the Jewish affairs after the death of Longimanus with out any mention of Darius II before Artaxerxes Mnemon or of the Ochus or Arogus as the Canon of Ptolemy names them after him Nor had he probably mentioned this other Artaxerxes unless liagcties one of the governors and comman ders under him had occasioned the pollution of the Jewish temple and had greatly  distressed the Jews upon that pollution Artaxerxes nder in my Persia Chap V Â IT ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 129 ter whose name was Nicaso in marriage to Manasseh as think ing this alliance by marriage would be a pledge and security that the nation of the Jews should continue their good will to him CHAP VIII Concerning Sanballat and Manasseh and the temple winch they built on mount Gerizzim as also how Alexander made his entry into the city Jerusalem  and what benefits he bestowed on the Jews Â 1 ABOUT this time it was that Philip king of Macedon was treacherously assaulted and slain at Egae by Pausanias the son of Cerastes who was derived from the family of Orestae and his son Alexander succeeded him in the kingdom who passing over the Hellespont overcame the generals of Darius army in a battle fought at Granicum So he marched over Lydia and subdued Ionia and overran Caria and fell upon the places of Pamphylia as has been related elsewhere 2 But the elders of Jerusalem being very uneasy that the brother of Jaddua the high priest though married to a foreigner should be a partner with him in the high priesthood quarrelled with him  for they esteemed this man s marriage a step to such as should be desirous of transgressing about the marriage of strange wives and that this would be the beginning of a mu tual society with foreigners although the offence of some about marriages and their having married wives that were not of their own country had been an occasion of their former capti vity and of the miseries they then underwent so they com manded Manasseh to divorce his wife or not to approach the al tar the high priest himself joining with the people in their in dignation against his brother and driving him away from the altar V hereupon Manasseh came to his father in law San ballat and told him That although he loved his daughter Nicaso yet he was not willing to be deprived of his sacerdotal dignity on her account which was the principal dignity in their nation and always continued in the same family And when Sanballat promised him not only to preserve to him the honour of his priesthood but to procure for him the power and dignity of a high priest and would make him governor of all the places he himself now ruled if he would keep his daughter for his wife He also told him farther that he would build him a temple like to that at Jerusalem upon mount Gerizzim which is the highest of all the mountains that are in Samaria and he promised that he would do this with the approbation of Darius the king Manasseh was elevated with these promises and stayed with Sanballat upon a supposal that he should gain a high priesthood as bestowed on him by Darius for it hap ISO ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XI pencd that Snnballat was then in years But there was now a great disturbance among the people of Jerusalem because many of those priests and Levites were entangled in such matches for they all revolted to Manasseh and Sanballat afforded them money and divided among them land for tillage and habitations also and all this in order every way to gratify his son in law 3 About this time it was that Darius heard how Alexander had passed over the Hellespont and had beaten his lieutenants in the battle of Granicum and was proceeding farther  where upon he gathered together an army of horse and foot and deter mined that he would meet the Macedonians before they should assault and conquer all Asia So he passed over the river Eu Ehrates and came over Taurus the Cicilian mountain and at ssus of Cilicia he waited for the enemy as ready there to give him battle Upon which Sanballat was glad that Darius was come down and told Manasseh that he would suddenly perform his promises to him and this as soon as ever Darius should come back after he had beaten his enemies for not he only but all those that were in Asia also were persuaded that the Macedonians would not so much as come to a battle with the Persians on account of their multitude But the event proved otherwise than they expected for the king joined battle with the Macedonians and was beaten and lost a great part of his army His mother also and his wife and children were taken captives and he fled into Persia So Alexander came into Syria and took Damascus and when he had obtained Sidon he besieged Tyre when he sent an epistle to the Jewish high priest To send him some auxiliaries and to supply his army with provisions and that what presents he formerly sent to Darius he would now send to him and choose the friendship of the Macedonians  and that he should never repent of so doing But the high priests answered the messengers That he had given his oath to Darius not to bear arms against him and he said that he would not transgress this while Darius was in the land of the living Upon hearing this answer Alexander was very an gry and though he determined not to leave Tyre which was just ready to be taken yet as soon as he had taken it he threat ened that he would make an expedition against the Jewish high priest and through him teach all men to whom they must keep their oaths So when he had with a good deal of pains during the siege taken Tyre and had settled its affairs he came to the city of Gaza and besieged both the city and him who was go vernor of the garrison whose name was Babemeses 4 But Sanballat thought he had now gotten a proper oppor tunity to make his attempt so he renounced Darius and taking with him seven thousand of his own subjects he came to Alex Chap VIII ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 131 ander and finding him beginning the siege of Tyre he said to him that he delivered up to him these men who came out of places under his dominion and did gladly accept of him for his lord instead of Darius So when Alexander had received him kindly Sanballat thereupon took courage and spake to him about his present affair He told him That he had a son in law Manasseh who was brother to the high priest Jaddua s and that there were many others of his own nation now with him that were desirous to have a temple in the same places subject to him that it would be for the king s advantage to have the strength of the Jews divided into two parts lest when the nation is of one mind and united upon any attempt for innovation it prove troublesome to kings as it had formerly proved to the kings of Assyria Whereupon Alexander gave Sanballat leave so to do who used the utmost diligence and built the temple and made Manasseh the priest and deemed it a great reward that his daughter s children should have that dignity but when the seven months of the siege of Tyre were over and the two months of the siege of Gaza Sanballat died Now Alexander when he had taken Gaza made haste to go up to Jerusalem  and Jaddua the high priest when he heard that was in an agony and under terror as not knowing how he should meet the Macedonians since the king was displeased at his foregoing disobedience He therefore ordained that the people should make supplications and should join with him in offering sacrifice to God whom he besought to protect that na tion and to deliver them from the perils that were coming up on them j Whereupon God warned him in a dream which came upon him after he had offered sacrifice That  he should take courage and adorn the city and open the gates  that the rest should appear in white garments but that he and the priests should meet the king in the habits proper to their order without the dread of any ill consequences which the provi dence of God would prevent Upon which when he rose from his sleep he greatly rejoiced and declared to all the warning he had received from God According to which dream hei act ed entirely and so waited for the coming of the king 5 And when he understood that he was not far from the cityy he went out in procession with the priests and the multitude of the citizens The procession was venerable and the manner of it different from that of other nations It reached to a place called Sapha which name translated into Greek signifies a pros pect for you have thence a prospect both of Jerusalem and of the temple and when the Phenicians and the Chaldeans  that followed him thought they should have liberty to plunder the city and torment the high priest to death which the king s dis pleasure fairly promised them the very reverse of it happened VOL n K 19 132 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XI for Alexander when he saw the multitude at a distance in white garments while the priest stood clothed with fine linen and the high priest in purple and scarlet clothing with his mitre on his head having the golden plate whereon the name of God was engraved he approached by himself and adored that name and first saluted the high priest The Jews also did altogether with one voice salute Alexander and encompass him about Where upon the king of Syria and the rest were surprised at what Alexander had done and supposed him disordered in his mind However Parmenio alone went up to him and asked him How it came to pass that when all others adored him he should adore the high priest of the Jews To whom he re plied  I did not adore him but that God who hath honoured him with his high priesthood for I saw this very person in a dream in this very habit when I was at Dios in Mace donia who when I was considering with myself how I might obtain the dominion of Asia exhorted me to make no delay but boldly to pass over the sea thither for that he would eon duct my army and would give me the dominion over the Persians whence it is that having seen no other in that ha bit and now seeing this person in it and remembering that vision and the exhortation which I had in my dream I believe that I bring this army under the divine conduct and shall therewith conquer Darius and destroy the power of the Per sians and that all things will succeed according to what is in my own mind And when he had said this to Parmenio and had given the high priest his right hand the priests ran along by him and he came into the city And when he went up into the temple he offered sacrifice to God according to the high priest s direction and magnificently treated both the high priest and the priests And when the  book of Daniel was showed him wherein Daniel declared that one of the Greeks should destroy the empire of the Persians he supposed that him self was the person intended And as he was then glad he dis missed the multitude for the present but the next day he called them to him and bid them ask what favours they pleased of him whereupon the high priest desired that they might enjoy the laws of their forefathers and might pay no tribute on the seventh year He granted all they desired And when they entreated him that he would permit the Jews in Babylon and Media to enjoy their own laws also he willingly promised to do hereafter what they desired And when he said to the multi tude that if any of them would list themselves in his army on this condition that they should continue under the laws of their  The place showed Alexander might be Dan vii 3â 8 20 21 22 xi 3 tome or all of them very olain oredii

his wars 6 So when Alexander had thus settled matters at Jerusalem he led his army into the neighbouring cities and when all the inhabitants to whom he came received him with great kindness the Samaritans who had then Shechem for their metropolis a city situate at mount Gerizzim and inhabited by apostates of the Jewish nation seeing that Alexander had so greatly honour ed the Jews determined to profess themselves Jews for such is the disposition of the Samaritans as we have already else where declared that when the Jews are in adversity they deny that they are of kin to them and then they confess the truth but when they perceive that some good fortune hath befallen them they immediately pretend to have communion with them saying that they belong to them and derive their genealogy from the posterity of Joseph Ephraim and Manasseh Accord ingly they made their address to the king with splendour and showed great alacrity in meeting him at a little distance from Je rusalem And when Alexander had commanded them the She chemites approached to him taking with them the troops that Sanballat had sent him and they desired that he would come to their city and do honour to their temple also To whom he promised that when he returned he would come to them And when they petitioned that he would remit the tribute of the seventh year to them because they did not sow thereon he asked who they were that made such a petition and when they said that they were Hebrews but had the name of Sidonians living at Shechem he asked them again whether they were Jews and when they said they were not Jews It was to the Jews said he that I granted that privilege however when I return and am thoroughly informed by you of this matter I will do what I shall think proper And in this manner he took leave of the Shechemites  but ordered that the troops of San ballat should follow him into Egypt because there he designed to give them lands which he did a little after in Thebais when he ordered them to guard that country 7 Now when Alexander was dead the government was part ed among his successors but the temple upon mount Gerizzim remained And if any one were accused by those of Jerusalem of having eaten things  common or of having broken the Sab bath or of any other crime of the like nature he fled away to the Shechemites and said that he was accused unjustly About this time it was that Jaddua the high priest died and Onias his son took the high priesthood This was the state of the affairs of the people of Jerusalem at this time   Here Josephus uses the very word K OINOPHAGIA

SEVENTY YEARS FROM THE DEATH OF ALEXANDER THE GREAT TO THE DEATH OF JUDAS MACCABEES CHAP I How Ptolemy the son of Lagus took Jerusalem and Judea by deceit and treachery and carried many of the Jews thence and planted them in Egypt Â 1 Now when Alexander king of Macedon had put an end to the dominion of the Persians and had settled the affairs in Judea after the forementioned manner he ended his life And as his government fell among many Antigonus obtained Asia Seleucus Babylon and of the other nations which were there Lysimachus governed the Hellespont and Cassander pos sessed Macedonia as did Ptolemy the son of Lagus seize upon Egypt And while these princes ambitiously strove one against another every one for his own principality it came to pass that there were continual wars and those lasting wars too and the cities were sufferers and lost a great many of their inhabi tants in these times of distress insomuch that all Syria by the means of Ptolemy the son of Lagus underwent the reverse of that denomination of Saviour which he then had He also seized upon Jerusalem and for that end made use of deceit and treachery for as he came into the city on a Sabbath day as if he would offer sacrifices he without any trouble gained the city while the Jews did not oppose him for they did not sus pect him to be their enemy and he gained it thus because they were free from suspicion of him and because on that day they were at rest and quietness and when he had gained it he ruled over it in a cruel manner Nay Agatharchides of Cni dus who wrote the acts of Alexander s successors reproaches us with superstition as if we by it had lost our liberty where he says thus  There is a nation called the nation of the Jews who inhabit a city strong and great named Jerusalem These men took no care but let it come into the hands of Ptolemy as not willing to take arms and thereby they sub mitted to be under a hard master by reason of their vmsea Chap II ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 113 sonable superstition This is what Agathafchides relates of our nation But when Ptolemy had taken a great many cap tives both from the mountainous parts of Judea and from the places about Jerusalem and Samaria and the places near mount Gerizzim he led them all into Egypt and settled them there And as he knew that the people of Jerusalem were f most faith ful in the observation of oaths and covenants and this from the answer they made to Alexander when he sent an ambassage to them after he had beaten Darius in battle so he distributed many of them into garrisons and at Alexandria gave them equal privileges of citizens with the Macedonians themselves and required of them to take their oaths that they would keep their fidelity to the posterity of those who committed these places to their care Nay there were not a few other Jews who of their own accord went into Egypt as invited by the goodness of the soil and by the liberality of Ptolemy How ever there were disorders among their posterity with relation to the Sa maritans on account of their resolution to preserve that con duct of life which was delivered to them by their forefathers and they thereupon contended one with another while those of Jerusalem said that their temple was holy and resolved to send their sacrifices thither but the Samaritans were resolved that they should be sent to mount Gerizzim CHAP II How Ptolemy

slavery there who were an hundred and twenty thousand The occa sion was this Demetrius Phalerius who was library keeper to the king was now endeavouring if it were possible to gather together all the books that were in the habitable earth and buying whatsoever was any where valuable or agreeable to the king s inclination who was very earnestly set upon collect ing of books to which inclination of his Demetrius was zeal ously subservient And when once Ptolemy asked him How many ten thousands of books he had collected he replied That he had already about twenty times ten thousand but that in a little time he should have fifty times ten thousand But he said he had been informed that there were many books of laws among the Jews worthy of inquiring after and worthy of the king s library but which being written in characters and in a dialect of their own will cause no small pains in getting them translated into the Greek tongue that the character in which they are written seems to be like to that which is the proper character of the Syrians and that its sound when pronounced is like theirs also and that this sound appears to be peculiar to themselves Wherefore he said that nothing hindered why they might not get those books to be translated also for while nothing is wanting that is necessary for that purpose we may have their books also in this library So the king thought that Demetrius was very zealous to procure him abundance of books and that he suggested what was exceeding proper for him to do and therefore he wrote to the Jewish high priest that he should act accordingly 2 Now there was one Aristeus who was among the king s most intimate friends and on account of his modesty very acceptable to him This Aristeus resolved frequently and that before now to petition the king that he would set all the cap tive Jews in his kingdom free and he thought this to be a con venient opportunity for the making that petition So he dis coursed in the first place with

For since we have determined not only to get the laws of the Jews transcribed but interpreted also for thy satisfaction by what means can we do this while so many of the Jews are now slaves in thy

because he breathes life into all men Wherefore do thou restore these men to their own coun try and this do to the honour of God because these men pay a peculiarly excellent worship to him And know this farther that though I be not of kin to them by birth nor one of the same country with them yet do I desire these favours to be done them since all men are the workmanship of God and I am sensible that he is well pleased with those that do good I do therefore put up this petition to thee to do good to them 3 When Aristeus was saying thus the king looked upon him with a cheerful and joyful countenance and said How many ten thousands dost thou suppose there are of such as want to be made free To which Andreas replied as he stood by and said  A few more than ten times ten thousand The king made answer And is this a small gift that thou askest Aristeus But Sosibius and the rest that stood by said That he ought to offer such a thank offering as was worthy of his greatness of soul to that God who had given him his kingdom With this answer he was much pleased and gave order that when they paid the soldiers their wages they should lay down a  hundred and twenty drachmae for  Although this number 120 drachma of Alexandria or 60 Jewish shekels be here three times repeated and that in all Josephus copies Greek and Latin yet since all the copies of Aristeus whence Josephus took his relation have this sum several times and still as no more than 20 drachmae or 10 Jewish shekels and since the sum of the talents to be set down presently which is little above 460 for somewhat more than 100 000 slaves and is nearly the same in Josephus and Aristeus does better agree to 20 than to 120 drachmae and smce the value of a slave of old was at the utmost but 3O shekels or 60 drachmae see Exod xxi 32 while in the present circumstances of these Jewish slaves and those so very numer ous Philadelphus would rather redeem them at a cheaper than at a dearer rate there is great reason to prefer here Aristeus copies before Josephus 138 ANTIQUITIES Of THE JEWS Book XII every one of the slaves And he promised to publish a magni ficent decree about what they requested which should confirm what Aristeus had proposed and especially what God willed should be done whereby he said he would not only set those free who had been led away captive by his father and his army but those who were in this kingdom before and those also if any such there were who had been brought away since And when they said that their redemption money would amount to above four hundred talents he granted it A copy of which decree I have determined to preserve that the magnanimity of this king may be made known Its contents were as follows Let all those who were soldiers under our father and who when they overran Syria and Phenicia and laid waste Judea took the Jews captives and made them slaves and brought  them into our cities and into this country and then sold them as also all those that were in my kingdom before them and if there be any that have been lately brought thither be made free by those that possess them and let them accept of an hundred and twenty drachmae for every slave And let the soldiers receive this redemption money with their pay but the rest out of the king s treasury for I suppose that they were made captives without our father s consent and against equity and that their country was harassed by the insolence of the soldiers and that by removing them into Egypt the soldiers have made a great profit by them Out of  regard therefore to justice and out of pity to those that have been tyrannized over contrary to equity I enjoin those that have such Jews in their service to set them at liberty upon the receipt of the beforementioned sum and that no one use any deceit about them but obey what is here commanded And I will that they give in their names within three days after the publication of this edict to such as are appointed to exe cute the same and to produce the slaves before them also for I think it will be for the advantage of my affairs And let every one that will inform against those that do not obey this decree and I will that their estates be confiscated into the king s treasury When this decree was read to the king it at first contained the rest that is here inserted and omitted only those Jews that had formerly been brought and those brought afterwards which had not been distinctly mentioned so he added these clauses out of his humanity and with great generosity He also gave order that the payment which was likely to be done in a hurry should be divided among the king s ministers and among the officers of his treasury When this was over what the king had decreed was quickly brought to a conclusion and this in no more than seven days time the num Chap II ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 139 ber of the talents paid for the captives being above four hundred and sixty and this because their masters required the hundred and twenty drachmae for the children also the king having in effect commanded that these should be paid for when he said in his decree that they should receive the forementioned sum for every slave 4 Now when this had been done after so magnificent a manner according to the king s inclinations he gave order to Demetrius to give him in writing his sentiments con cerning the transcribing of the Jewish books for no part of the administration is done rashly by these kings but all things are managed with great circumspection On which account I have subjoined a copy of these epistles and set down the multi tude of the vessels sent as gifts to Jerusalem and the construc tion of every one that the exactness of the artificer s workman ship as it appeared to those that saw them and which workman made every vessel may be made manifest and this on account of the excellency of the vessels themselves Now the copy of the epistle was to this purpose Demetrius to the great king Vhen thou O king gavest me a charge concerning the col lection of books that were wanting to fill your library and concerning the care that ought to be taken about such as are imperfect I have used the utmost diligence about those mat ters And I let you know that we want the books of the Jewish legislation with some others for they are written in the Hebrew characters and being in the language of that na tion are to us unknown It hath also happened to them that they have been transcribed more carelessly than they ought to have been because they have not had hitherto royal care taken about them Now it is necessary that thou shouldest have accurate copies of them And indeed this legislation is full of hidden wisdom and entirely blameless as being the legislation of God For which cause it is as Hecateus of Ab dera says that the poets and historians make no mention of it nor of those men who lead their lives according to it since it is a holy law and ought not to be published by profane mouths If then it please thee O King thou mayest write to the high priest of the Jews to send six of the elders out of every tribe and those such as are most skilful of the laws that by their means we may learn the clear and agreeing sense of these books and may obtain an accurate interpretation of their contents and so may have such a collection of these as may be suitable to thy desire 5 When this epistle was sent to the king he commanded that an epistle should be drawn up for Eleazar the Jewish high priest concerning these matters and that they should inform VOL II S 19 140 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XIL him of the release of the Jews that had been in slavery among them He also sent fifty talents of gold for the making of large basons and vials and cups and an immense quantity of precious stones He also gave orders to those who had the custody of the chest that contained these stones to give the artificers leave to choose out what sorts of them they pleased He withal appointed that a hundred talents in money should be sent to the temple for sacrifices and for other uses Now I will give a description of these vessels and the manner of their construction but not till after I have set down a copy of the epistle which was written to Eleazar the high priest who had obtained that dignity on the occasion following when Onias the high priest was dead his son Simon became his successor He was called  Simon the Just because of both his piety towards God and his kind disposition to those of his own nation When he was dead and had left a young son who was called Onias Simon s brother Eleazar of whom we are speaking took the high priesthood and he it was to whom Ptolemy wrote and that in the manner following King Ptolemy to Eleazar the high priest sendeth greeting There are many Jews who now dwell in my kingdom whom the Persians when they were in power carried captives These were honoured by my father some of them he placed in the army and gave them greater pay than ordinary to others of them when they came with him into Egypt he com mitted his garrisons and the guarding of them that they might be a terror to the Egyptians And when I had taken the government I treated all men with humanity and espe cially those that are thy fellow citizens of whom I have set free above a hundred thousand that were slaves and paid the price of their redemption to their masters out of my own re venues and those that are of a fit age I have admitted into the number of my soldiers And for such as are capable of being faithful to me and proper for my court I have put them in such a post as thinking this kindness done to them to be a very great and an acceptable gift which I devote to God for his providence over me And as I am desirous to do what will be grateful to these and to all the other Jews in the habitable earth I have determined to procure an interpre tation of your law and to have it translated out of Hebrew into Greek and to be reposited in my library Thou wilt therefore do well to choose out and send to me men of a good character who are now elders in age and six in number out  We have a very great encomium of this Simon the Just the son of Onias I in the fiftieth chapter of the Ecclesiasticus through the whole chapter Nor is it im proper to consult that chapter itself upon this occasion Chap II ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 141 of every tribe These by their age must be skilful in the laws and of abilities to make Tm accurate interpretation of them and when this shall be finished I shall think that I have done a work glorious to myself And I have sent to thee Andreas the captain of my guard and Aristeus men whom I have in very great esteem by whom I have sent those first fruits which I have dedicated to the temple and to the sacrifices and to other uses to the value of a hundred talents And if thou wilt send to us to let us know what thou wouldest have farther thou wilt do a thing acceptable to Â me 6 When this epistle of the king s was brought to Eleazar he wrote an answer to it with all the respect possible Eleazar the high priest to king Ptolemy sendeth greeting If thou and thy  queen Arsinoe and thy children be well we are entirely satisfied When we received thy epistle we greatly rejoiced at thy intentions And when the multitude were ga thered together we read it to them and thereby made them sensible of the piety thou hast towards God We also showed them the twenty vials of gold and thirty of silver and the five large basons and the table for the show bread as also the hundred talents for the sacrifices and for the making what shall be needful at the temple Which things Andreas and Aristeus those most honoured friends of thine have brought us and truly they are persons of an excellent character and of great learning and worthy of thy virtue Know then that we will gratify thee in what is for thy advantage though we do what we used not to do before for we ought to make a re turn for the numerous acts of kindness which thou hast done to our countrymen We immediately therefore offered sa crifices for thee and thy sister with thy children and friends and the multitude made prayers that thy affairs may be to thy mind and that thy kingdom may be preserved in peace and that the translation of our law may come to the conclusion thou desirest and be for thy advantage We have also chosen six elders out of every tribe whom we have sent and the law with them It will be thy part out of thy piety and justice to send back the law when it hath been translated and to return those to us that bring it in safety Farewell 7 This was the reply which the high priest made But it  When we have here and presently mention made of Philadelphia queen and sister Arsinoe we are to remember with Spanheim that Arsinoe was both bis sis ter and his wife according to the old custom of Persia and of Egypt at this very time nay of the Assyrians long afterward See Antiq B XX ch ii sect I vol III Whence we have upon the coins of Philadelphus this known inscription tAe divine brother and sister 142 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XII does not seem to me to be necessary to set down the names of the seventy two elders who were sent by Eleazar and carried the law which yet were subjoined at the end of the epistle However I thought it not improper to give an account of those very valuable and artificially contrived vessels which the king sent to God that all may see how great a regard tire king had for God for the king allowed a vast deal of expenses for these vessels and came often to the workmen and viewed their works and suffered nothing of carelessness or negligence to be any da mage to their operations And I will relate how rich they were as well as I am able although perhaps the nature of this history may not require such a description but I imagine I shall thereby recommend the elegant taste and magnanimity of this king to those that read this history 8 And first I will describe what belongs to the table It was indeed in the king s mind to make this table vastly large in its dimensions but then he gave orders that they should learn what was the magnitude of the table which was already at Jerusalem and how large it was and whether there were a possibility of making one larger than it And when he was informed how large that was which was already there and that nothing hin dered but a larger might be made he said That  he was wil ling to have one made that should be five times as large as the present table but his fear was that it might be then useless in their sacred ministrations by its too great largeness for he desired that the gifts he presented them should not only be there for show but should be useful also in their sacred mi nistrations According to which reasoning that the former table was made of so moderate a size for use and not for want of gold he resolved that he would not exceed the former table in largeness but would make it exceed it in the variety and elegancy of its materials And as he was sagacious in observing the nature of all things and in having a just notion of what was new and surprising and where there was no sculptures he would invent such as were proper by his own skill and would show them to the workmen he commanded that such sculptures should now be made and that those which were delineated should be most accurately formed by a constant regard to their delineation 9 When therefore the workmen had undertaken to make the table they framed it in length two cubits and a half in breadth one cubit and in height one cubit and a half and the entire structure of the work was of gold They withal made a crown of a hand breadth round it with wave work wreathed about it and with an engraving imitated a cord and was admir ably turned on its three parts for as they Were of a triangular Chap II ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 143 figure every angle had the same disposition of its sculptures that when you turned them about the very same form of them was turned about without any variation Now that part of the crown work that was inclosed under the table had its sculptures very beautiful but that part which went round on the outside was naore elaborately adorned with most beautiful ornaments because it was exposed to sight and to the view of the spectators for which reason it was that both those sides which were extant above the rest were acute and none of the angles which we before told you were three appeared less than another when the table was turned about Now into the cord work thus turned were precious stones inserted in rows parallel one to the other inclosed in golden buttons which had ouches in them but the parts which were on the side of the crown and were exposed to the sight were adorned with a row of oval figures obliquely placed of the most excellent sort of precious stones which imitated rods laid close and encompassed the table round about But under these oval figures thus engraven the workmen had put a crown all round it where the nature of all sorts of fruit was represented insomuch that the bunches of grapes hung up And when they had made the stones to re present all the kinds of fruit before mentioned and that each in its proper colour they made them fast with gold round the whole table The like disposition of the oval figures and of theengraved rods was framed under the crown that the table might on each side show the same appearance of variety and elegancy of its ornaments so that neither the position of the wave work nor of the crown might be different although the table were turned on the other side but that the prospect of the most artificial contri vances might be extended as far as the feet for there was made a plate of gold of four fingers broad through the entire breadth of the table into which they inserted the feet and then fastened them to the table by buttons and button holes at the place where the crown was situate that so on what side soever of the table one should stand it might exhibit the very same view of the exquisite workmanship and of the vast expenses bestowed upon it but upon the table itself they engraved a meander in serting into it very valuable stones in the middle like stars of va rious colours the carbuncle and the emerald each of which sent out agreeable rays of light to the spectators with such stones of other sorts also as were most curious and best esteemed as being most precious in their kind Hard by this meander a texture of net work ran round it the middle of which appeared like a rhombus into which were inserted rock chrystal and am ber which by the great resemblance of the appearance they made gave wonderful delight to those that saw them The 144 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XII chapiters of the feet imitated the first buddings of lilies while their leaves were bent and laid under the table but so that the chives were seen standing upright within them Their bases were made of a carbuncle and the place at the bottom which rested on that carbuncle was one palm deep and eight fingers in breadth Now they had engraven upon it with a very fine tool and with a great deal of pains a branch of ivy and tendrils of the vine sending forth clusters of grapes that you would guess they were no wise different from real tendrils for they were so very thin and so very far extended at their extremities that they were moved with the wind and made one believe that they were the product of nature and not the representation of art They also made the entire workmanship of the table appear to be threefold while the joints of the several parts were so united together as to be invisible and the places where they joined could not be distinguished Now the thickness of the table was not less than half a cubit So that this gift by the king s great generosity by the great value of the materials and the variety of its exquisite structure and the artificer s skill in imitating nature with graving tools was at length brought to perfection while the king was very desirous that though in largeness it were not to be different from that which was already dedicated to God yet that in exquisite workmanship and the novelty of the contrivances and in the splendour of its construction it should far exceed it and be more illustrious than that was 10 Now of the cisterns of gold there were two whose sculp ture was of scale work from its basis to its belt like circle with various sorts of stones inchased in the spiral circles Next to which there was upon it a meander of a cubit in height it was composed of stones of all sorts of colours And next to this was the rod work engraven and next to that was a rhombus in a texture of net work drawn out to the brim of the bason while small shields made of stones beautiful in their kind and of four fingers depth filled up the middle parts About the top of the bason were wreathed the leaves of lilies and of the convolvulus and the tendrils of vines in a circular manner And this was the construction of the two cisterns of gold each containing two firkins But those which were of silver were much more bright and splendid than looking glasses and you might in them see the images that fell upon them more plainly than in the other The king also ordered thirty vials those of which the parts that were of gold and not filled up with precious stones were shadow ed over with the leaves of ivy and of vines artificially engraven And these were the vessels that were after an extraordinary manner brought to this perfection partly by the skill of the workmen who were admirable in such fine work but much Chap II ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 145 more by the diligence and generosity of the king who not only supplied the artificers abundantly and with great generosity with what they wanted but he forbade public audiences for the time and came and stood by the workmen and saw the whole operation And this was the cause why the workmen were so accurate in their performance because they had regard to the king and to his great concern about the vessels and so the more indefatigably kept close to the work 11 And these were what gifts were sent by Ptolemy to Je rusalem and dedicated to God there But when Eleazar the high priest had devoted them to God and had paid due respect to those that brought them and had given them presents to be carried to the king he dismissed them And when they were come to Alexandria and Ptolemy heard that they were come and that the seventy elders were come also he presently sent for An dreas and Aristeus his ambassadors who came to him and de livered him the epistle which they had brought him from the high priest and made answer to all the questions he put to them by word of mouth He then made haste to meet the elders that came from Jerusalem for the interpretation of the laws and he gave command that every body who came on occasions should be sent away which was a thing surprising and what he did not use to do for those that there were drawn thither upon such oc casions used to come to him on the fifth day but ambassadors at the month s end But when he had sent those away he waited for these that were sent by Eleazar but as the old men came in with the presents which the high priest had given them to bring to the king and with the membranes upon which they had their laws written  in golden letters he put questions to them con cerning those books and when they had taken off the covers wherein they were wrapt up they showed him the membranes So the king stood admiring the thinness of those membranes and the exactness of the junctures which could not be perceiv ed so exactly were they connected one with another and this he did for a considerable time He then said that he returned them thanks for coming to him and still greater thanks to him that sent them  and above all to that God whose laws they ap peared to be Then did the elders and those that were present with them cry out with one voice and wished all happiness to the king Upon which he fell into tears by the violence of the pleasure he had it being natural to men to afibrd the same indications in great joy that they do under sorrows And when  he had bid them deliver the books to those that were appointed  The Talmudists say that it is not lawful to write the law in letters of gold contrary to  this certain and very ancient example See Hudson s and Reland s notes here 146 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XIT to receive them he saluted the men and said that it was but just to discourse in the first place of the errand they were sent about and then to address himself to themselves He promised however that he would make this day on which they came to him remarkable and eminent every year through the whole course of his life for their coming to him and the victory which he gained over Antigonus by sea proved to be on the very same day He also gave orders that they should sup with him and gave it in charge that they should have excellent lodgings pro vided for them in the upper part of the city 12 Now he that was appointed to take care of the reception of strangers Nicanor by name called for Dorotheus whose duty it was to make provision for them and bid him prepare for every one of them what should be requisite for their diet and way of living Which thing was ordered by the king after this man ner he took care that those that belonged to every city which did not use the same way of living that all things should be pre pared for them according to the custom of those that came to him that being feasted according to the usual method of their own way of living they might be the better pleased and might not be uneasy at any thing done to them from which they were naturally averse And this was now done in the case of these men by Dorotheus who was put into this office because of his great skill in such matters belonging to common life  for he took care of all such matters as concerned the reception of strangers and appointed them double seats for them to sit on according as the king had commanded him to do for he had commanded that half of their seats should be set at his hand and the other half behind his table and took care that no respect should be omitted that could be shown them And when they were thus set down he bid Dorotheus to minister to all those that were come to him from Judea after the manner they used to be ministered to for which cause he sent away their sacred heralds and those that slew the sacrifices and the rest that used to say grace  but call ed to one of those that were come to him whose name was Eleazar who was a priest and desired him to  say grace who then stood in the midst of them and prayed that  all prosperi ty might attend the king and those that were his subjects Up  This is the most ancient example I have met with of a grace or short prayer or thanksgiving before meat which as it used to be said by an heathen priest was now said by Eleazar a Jewish priest who was one of these seventy two inter preters The next example I have met with is that of the Essenes Of the War B II chap viii sect 5 vol III both before and after it those of our Saviour before it Mark viii 6 John vi 11 23 and St Paul Acts xxvii S3 and a form of such a grace or prayer for Christians at the end of the fifth book of the Apostolical Con stitutions which seems to have been intended for both times both before and after meat Chap II ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 147 on which an acclamation was made by the whole company with joy and a great noise and when that was over they fell to eat ing their supper and to the enjoyment of what was set before them And at a little interval afterward when the king thought a sufficient time had been interposed he began to talk philoso phically to them and he asked every one of them a  philoso phical question and such an one as might give light in those in quiries and when they had explained all the problems that had been proposed by the king about every point he was well pleased with their answers This took up the twelve days in which they were treated and he that pleases may learn the particular ques tions in that book of Aristeus which he wrote on this very occasion 13 And while not the king only but the philosopher Mene demus also admired them and said  that all things were go verned by providence  and that it was probable that thence it was that such force or beauty was discovered in these men s words they then left off asking any more such ques tions But the king said that he had gained very great advan tages by their coming for that he had received this profit from them that he had learned how he ought to rule his subjects And he gave order that they should have every one three ta lents given them and that those that were to conduct them to their lodging should do it Accordingly when three days were over Demetrius took them and went over the causeway seven furlongs long It was a bank in the sea to an island And when they had gone over the bridge he proceeded to the northern parts and showed them where they should meet which was ir a house which was built near the shore and was a quiet place and fit for their discoursing together about their work When he had brought them thither he entreated them now they had all things about them which they wanted for the interpretation of their law that they would suffer nothing to interrupt them in their work Accordingly they made an accurate interpre tation with great zeal and great pains and this they continued to do till the ninth hour of the day after which time they re laxed and took care of their body while their food was pro vided for them in great plenty besides Dorotheus at the king s command brought them a great deal of what was provided for the king himself But in the morning they came to the court and saluted Ptolemy and then went away to their former place where when they hadf washed their hands and purified them  They were rather political questions and answers tending to the good and re ligious government of mankind  This purification of the interpreters by washing in the sea before they prayed to God every morning and I efore they set about translating may be VOL II T 19 148 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XII selves they betook themselves to the interpretation of the laws Now when the law was transcribed and the labour of interpre tation was over which came to its conclusion in seventy two days Demetrius gathered all the Jews together to the place where the laws were translated and where the interpreters were and read them over The multitude did also approve of those elders that were the interpreters of the law They withal commended Demetrius for his proposal as the inventor of what was greatly for their happiness and they desired that he would give leave to their rulers also to read the law More over they all both the priest and the ancientest of the elders and the principal men of their commonwealth made it their request that since the interpretation was happily finished it might continue in the state it now was and might not be altered And when they all commended that determination of theirs they enjoined that if any one observed either any thing super fluous or any thing omitted that he would take a view of it again and have it laid before them and corrected which was a wise account of theirs that when the thing was judged to have been well done it might continue for ever 13 So the king rejoiced when he saw that his design of this nature was brought to perfection to so great advantage and he was chiefly delighted with hearing the laws read to him and was astonished at the deep meaning and wisdom of the legislator And he began to discourse with Demetrius How it came to pass that when this legislation was so wonderful no one either of the poets or of the historians had made mention of it Demetrius made answer that no one durst be so bold as to touch upon the description of these laws because they were divine and venerable and because some that had attempt ed it were afflicted by God He also told him that  Theo pompouse was desirous of writing somewhat about them but was thereupon disturbed in his mind for above thirty days time and upon some intermission of his distemper he appeas ed God by prayer as suspecting that his madness proceed ed from that cause Nay indeed hefurthersawinadream that his distemper befell him while he indulged too great a curiosity about divine matters and was desirous of publishing them among common men but when he left off that attempt he recovered his understanding again Moreover he informed him of Theodectes the tragic poet concerning whom it was reported compared with the like practice of Peter the apostle in the recognitions of Clement B IV chap iii and B V chap xxxvi and with the places of the Proseuthaj or of prayer which were sometimes built near the sea or rivers also Of which matter see Antiq B XIV ch x sect 23 Vol II and Acts xvi 13 16 Chap III ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 1 9 that when in a certain dramatic representation he was desirous to make mention of things that were contained in the sacred books he was afflicted with a darkness in his eyes and that upon his being conscious of the occasion of his distemper and appeasing God by prayer he was freed from that affliction 14 And when the king had received these books from De metrius as we have said already he adored them and gave order that great care should be taken of them that they might remain uncorrupted He also desired that the interpreters would come often to him out of Judea and that both on account of the respects that he would pay them and on account of the presents he would make them For he said It was now but just to send them away although if of their own accord they would come to him hereafter they should obtain all that their own wisdom might justly require and what his generosity was able to give them So he then sent them away and gave to every one of them three garments of the best sort and two ta lents of gold and a cup of the value of one talent and the fur niture of the room wherein they were feasted And these were the things he presented to them But by them he sent to Elea zar the high priest ten beds with feet of silver and the fur niture to them belonging and a cup of the value of thirty ta lents and besides these ten garments and purple and a very beautiful crown and a hundred pieces of the finest woven linen as also vials and dishes and vessels for pouring and two golden cisterns to be dedicated to God He also desired him by an epistle that he would give these interpreters leave if any of them were desirous of coming to him because he highly valued a conversation with men of such learning and should be very willing to lay out his wealth upon such men And this was what came to the Jews and was much to their glory and honour from Ptolemy Philadelphus CHAP III How the kings of Asia honoured the nation of the Jews and made them citizens of those cities which they built Â 1 1 HE Jews also obtained honour from the kings of Asia when they became their auxiliaries for Seleucus Nicator made them citizens in those cities which he built in Asia and in the lower Syria and in the metropolis itself Antioch and gave them privileges equal to those of the Macedonians and Greeks who were the inhabitants insomuch that these privi leges continue to this very day An argument for which you 150 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XII have in this that whereas the Jews do not make use of oil pre pared by foreigners they receive a certain sum of money from the proper officers belonging to their exercises as the value would have deprived them of in the last war Mucianus who was then president of Syria preserved it to them And when the people of Alexandria and of Antioch did after that at the tune that Vespasian and Titus his son governed the habitable earth pray that these privileges of citizens might be taken away they did not obtain their request In which behaviour any one may discern the f equity and generosity of the Romans es pecially of Vespasian and Titus who although they had been at a great deal of pains in the war against the Jews and were exasperated against them because they did not deliver up their weapons to them but continued the war to the very last yet did not they take away any of their forementioned privileges belonging to them as citizens but restrained their anger and overcame the prayers of the Alexandrians and Antiochians who were a very powerful people insomuch that they did not yield to them neither out of their favour to those people nor out of their old grudge at those whose wicked opposition they had sub dued in the war nor would they alter any of the ancient favours granted to the Jews but said that those who had borne arms against them and fought them had suffered punishment already and that it was not just to deprive those that had not offended of the privileges they enjoyed 2 We also know that Marcus Agrippa was of the like dis position towards the Jews For when the people of Ionia were very angry at them and besought Agrippa that they and they only might have those privileges of citizens which Antiochus the grandson of Seleucus who by the Greeks was called the God had bestowed on them and desired that if the Jews were to be joint partakers with them they might be obliged to worship the gods they themselves worshipped but when these matters were brought to the trial the Jews prevailed and ob  The use of oil was much greater and the donatives of it much more valuable in Judea and the neighbouring countries than it is amongst us It was also in the days of Josephus thought unlawful for Jews to make use of any oil that was prepared by heathens perhaps on account of some superstitions intermixed with its preparation by those heathens When therefore the heathens were to make them a donative of oil they paid them money instead of it See Of the War B II ch xxii sect 2 vol III the Life of Josephus sect 13 vol III and Hudson s note on the place before us  This and the like great and just characters of the justice and equity and ge nerosity of the old Romans both to the Jews and other conquered nations affords us a very good reason why Almighty God upon the rejection of the Jews for their wickedness chose them for his people and first established Christianity in that empire Of which matter see Josepbus here sect 2 as also Antiq B XIV ch X sect 21 23 B XVI chap 2 sect 4 Chap III ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 151 tained leave to make us of their own customs and this under the patronage of Nicolaus of Damascus for Agrippa gave sen tence that he could not innovate And if any one hath a mind to know this matter accurately let him peruse the hundred and twenty third and hundred and twenty fourth book of the his tory of this Nicolaus Now as to this determination of Agrip pa it is not so much to be admired for at this time our nation had not made war against the Romans But one may well be astonished at the generosity of Vespasian and Titus that after so great wars and conquests which they had from us they should use such moderation But I will now return to that part of my history whence I made the present digression 3 Now it happened that in the reign of Antiochus the Great who ruled over all Asia that the Jews as well as the inhabi tants of Celossyria suffered greatly and their land was sorely har rassed For while he was at war with Ptolemy Philopater and with his son who was called Epiphanes it fell out that these nations were equally sufferers both when he was beaten and when he beat the others So that they were very like to a ship in a storm which is tossed by the waves on both sides and just thus were they in their situation in the middle between Antio chus prosperity and its change to adversity But at length when Antiochus had beaten Ptolemy he seized upon Judea And when Philopater was dead his son sent out a great army under Scopas the general of his forces against the inhabitants of Celcesyria who took many of their cities and in particular our nation which when he fell upon them went over to him Yet was it not long afterward when Antiochus overcame Sco pas in a battle fought at the fountains of Jordan and destroyed a great part of his army But afterward when Antiochus sub dued those cities of Celcesyria which Scopas had gotten into his possession and Samaria with them the Jews of their own ac cord went over to him and received him into the city Jeru salem and gave plentiful provision to all his army and to his elephants and readily assisted him when he besieged the garrison which was in the citadel of Jerusalem Wherefore Antiochus thought it but just to requit the Jews diligence and zeal in his service So he wrote to the generals of his armies and to his friends and gave testimony to the good behaviour of the Jews towards him and informed them what rewards he had resolved to bestow on them for that their behaviour I will set down presently the epistles themselves which he wrote to the generals concerning them but will first produce the testimonies of Poly bius of Megalopolis for thus does he speak in the sixteenth book of his history Now Scopas the general of Ptolemy s army went in haste to the superior parts of the country and 152 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XII in the winter time overthrew the nation of the Jews He al so saith in the same book that when Scopas was conquered by Antiochus Antiochus received Batanea and Samaria and Abila and Gadara and that a while afterwards there came in to him those Jews that inhabited near that temple which was called Jerusalem concerning which although I have more to say and particularly concerning the presence of God about the temple yet do I put off that history till another opportunity This it is which Polybius relates But we will return to the series of the history when we have first pro duced the epistle of king Antiochus King ANTIOCHUS to PTOLEMY sendeth greeting Since the Jews upon our first entrance on their country de monstrated their friendship towards us and when we came to their city Jerusalem received us in a splendid manner and came to meet us with their senate and gave abundance of provisions to our soldiers and to the elephants and joined with us in ejecting the garrison of the Egyptians that were in the citadel we have thought fit to reward them and to re trieve the condition of their city which had been greatly de populated by such accidents as have befallen its inhabitants and to bring those that have been scattered abroad back to the  city And in the first place we have determined on ac count of their piety towards God to bestow on them as a pension for their sacrifices of animals that are fit for sacrifice for wine and oil and frankincense the value of twenty thou sand pieces of silver and six sacred artabrae of fine flour with one thousand four hundred and sixty medimni of wheat and three hundred and seventy five medimni of salt And these payments I would have fully paid them as I have sent orders to you I would also have the work about the temple finished and the cloisters and if there be any thing else that ought to be rebuilt And for the materials of wood let it be brought them out of Judea itself and out of the other countries and out of Libanus tax free and the same I would have observed as to those other materials which will be ne cessary in order to render the temple more glorious And let all of that nation live according to the laws of their own coun try and let the senate and the priests and the scribes of the temple and the sacred singers be discharged from poll mo ney and the crown tax and other taxes also And that the city may the sooner recover its inhabitants I grant a dis charge from taxes for three years to its present inhabitants and to such as shall come to it until the month Hyperbere Chap III ANTIQUITIES or THE JEWS 153 tus We also discharge them for the future from a third part of their taxes that the losses they have sustained may be repaired And all those citizens that have been carried away and are become slaves we grant them and their chil dren their freedom and give order that their substance be restored to them 4 And these were the contents of this epistle He also pub lished a decree through all his kingdom in honour of the tem ple which contained what follows It shall be lawful for no foreigner to come within the limits of the temple round about which thing is forbidden also to the Jews unless to those who according to their own custom have purified themselves Nor let any flesh of horses or of mules or of asses be brought into the city whether they be wild or tame nor that of leopards or foxes or hares and in general that of any animal which is forbidden for the Jews to eat Nor let their skins be brought into it nor let any such animal be bred up in the city Let them only be permitted to use the sacrifices derived from their forefathers with which they have been obliged to make acceptable atonements to God And he that transgresseth any of these orders let him pay to the priests three thousand drachmae of silver More over this Antiochus bare testimony to our piety and fidelity in an epistle of his written when he was informed of a sedition in Phrygia and Lydia at which time he was in the superior pro vinces wherein he commanded Zeuxis the general of his for ces and his most intimate friend to send some of our nation out of Babylon into Phrygia The epistle was this King ANTIOCHUS to ZEUXIS his father sendeth greeting If you are in health it is well I also am in health Hav ing been informed that a sedition is arisen in Lydia and Phrygia I thought that matter required great care And upon advising with my friends what was fit to be done it hath been thought proper to remove two thousand families of Jews with their effects out of Mesopotamia and Babylon unto the castles and places that lie most convenient for I am persuaded that they will be well disposed guardians of our possessions because of their piety towards God and because I know that my predecessors have borne witness to them that they are faithful and with alacrity do what they are desired to do I will therefore though it be a laborious work that thou remove these Jews under a promise that they shall be permitted to use their own laws And when thou shalt have brought them to the places forementioned thou shalt give every one of their families a place for building their houses 154 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XII and a portion of land for their husbandry and for the planta tion of their vines and thou shalt discharge them from pay ing taxes of the fruits of the earth for ten years and let them have a proper quantity of wheat for the maintenance of their servants until they receive bread corn out of the earth also let a sufficient share be given to such as minister to them in the necessaries of life that by enjoying the effects of our hu manity they may show themselves the more willing and ready about our affairs Take care likewise of that nation as far as thou art able that they may not have any disturb ance given them by any one Now these testimonials which I have produced are sufficient to declare the friendship that Antiochus the Great bare to the Jews CHAP IV How Antiochus made a league with Ptolemy and how Onias pro voked Ptolemy Euergetes to anger and how Joseph brought all things right again and entered into friendship with him and what other things were done by Joseph and his son Hyrcanus Â 1 AFTER this Antiochus made a friendship and a league with Ptolemy and gave him his daughter Cleopatra to wife and yielded up to him Celcesyria and Samaria and Judea and Phenicia by way of dowry And upon the division of the taxes between the two kings all the principal men farmed the taxes of their several countries and collecting the sum that was settled for them paid the same to the two kings Now at this time the Samaritans were in a flourishing condition and much distressed the Jews cutting off parts of their land and carrying off slaves This happened when Onias was high priest for after Eleazar s death his uncle Manasseh took the priesthood and after he had ended his life Onias received that dignity He was the son of Simon who was called the Just which Simon was the brother of Eleazar as I said before This Onias was one of a little soul and a great lover of money and for that reason because he did not pay the tax of twenty ta lents of silver which his forefathers paid to these kings out of their own estates he provoked king Ptolemy Euergetes to anger who was the father of Philopater Euergetes sent an am bassador to Jerusalem and complained that Onias did not pay his taxes and threatened that if he did not receive them he would seize upon their land and send soldiers to live upon it When the Jews heard this message of the king s they were con founded But so sordidly covetous was Onias that nothing of this nature made him ashamed Chap IV ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 155 2 There was now one Joseph young in age but of great re putation among the people of Jerusalem for gravity prudence and justice His father s name was Tobias and his mother was the sister of Onias the high priest who informed him of the coming of the ambassador for he was then sojourning at a vil lage named  Phicol where he was bom Hereupon he came to the city Jerusalem and reproved Onias for not taking care of the preservation of his countrymen but bringing the nation into dangers by not paying this money For which preserva tion of them he told him he had received the authority over them and had been made high priest But that in case he was so great a lover of money as to endure to see his country in danger on that account and his countrymen suffer the greatest damages he advised him to go to the king and petition him to remit either the whole or part of the sum demanded Onias answer was this that he did not care for his authority and that he was ready if the thing were practicable to lay down his high priesthood and that he would not go to the king because he troubled not himself at all about such matters Joseph then asked him If he would not give him leave to go ambassador on behalf of the nation He replied that he would give him leave Upon which Joseph went up into the temple and called the mul titude together to a congregation and exhorted them not to be disturbed nor affrighted because of his uncle Onias careless ness but desired them to be at rest and not terrify themselves with fear about it for he promised them that he would be their ambassador to the king and persuade him that they had done him no wrong And when the multitude heard this they re turned thanks to Joseph So he went down from the temple and treated Ptolemy s ambassador in a hospitable manner He also presented him with rich gifts and feasted him magni ficently for many days and then sent him to the king before him and told him that he would soon follow him for he was now more willing to go to the king by the encouragement of the ambassador who earnestly persuaded him to come into Egypt and promised him that he would take care that he should obtain every thing that he desired of Ptolemy for he was highly pleased with his frank and liberal temper and with the gravity of his deportment 3 When Ptolemy s ambassador was come into Egypt he told the king of the thoughtless temper of Onias and informed him of the goodness of the disposition of Joseph and that he was  The name of this place Phicol is the very same with that of the chief captain of Abimelech s host in the days of Abraham Gen xxi 22 and might possibly be the place of that Fhicol s nativity or abode for it seems to have been in the south part of Palestine as ihnt was vou iI u 19 156 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XIJ coming to him to excuse the multitude as not having done him any harm for that he was their patron In short he was so very large in his encomiums upon the young man that he disposed both the king and his wife Cleopatra to have a kindness for him before he came So Joseph sent to his friends at Samaria and borrowed money of them and got ready what was necessary for his journey garments and cups and beasts for burthen which amounted to about twenty thousand drachmae and went to Alex andria Now it happened that at this time all the principal men and rulers went up out of the cities of Syria and Phenicia to bid for their taxes for every year the king sold them to the men of the greatest power in every city So these men saw Jo seph journeying on the way and laughed at him for his poverty and meanness But when he came to Alexandria and heard that king Ptolemy was at Memphis he went up thither to meet with him which happened as the king was sitting in his cha riot with his wife and with his friend Athenion who was the very person who had been ambassador at Jerusalem and been en tertained by Joseph As soon therefore as Athenion saw him he presently made him known to the king how good and gene rous a young man he was So Ptolemy saluted him first and desired him to come up into his chariot and as Joseph sat there he began to complain of the management of Onias To which he answered Forgive him on account of his age for thou canst not certainly be unacquainted with this that old men and in fants have their minds exactly alike but thou shalt have from us who are young men every thing thou desirest and shalt have no cause to complain With this good humour and pleasantry of the young man the king was so delighted that he began al ready as though he had long experience of him to have a still greater affection for him insomuch that he bade him take his diet in the king s palace and be a guest at his own table every day But when the king was come to Alexandria the principal men of Syria saw him sitting with the king and were much of fended at it 4 And when the day came on which the king was to let the taxes of the cities to farm and those that were the principal men of dignity in their several countries were to bid for them the sum of the taxes together of Celesyria and Phenicia and Judea with Samaria as they were bidden for came to eight thousand talents Hereupon Joseph accused the bidders as hav ing agreed together to estimate the value of the taxes at too low a rate and he promised that he would himself give twice as much for them but for those who did not pay he would send the king home their whole substance for this privilege was sold together with the taxes themselves The king was pleased Clmp IV ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 157 to hear that offer and because it augmented his revenues he said he would confirm the sale of the taxes to him But then he asked him this question Whether he had any sureties that would be bound for the payment of the money he answered very pleasantly I will give such security and those of persons good and responsible and which you shall have no reason to dis trust And when he bid him name them who they were he replied I give thee no other persons O king for my sureties than myself and this thy wife and you shall be security for both parties So Ptolemy laughed at the proposal and granted him the farming of the taxes without any sureties This pro cedure was a sore grief to those that came from the cities into Egypt who were utterly disappointed and they returned every one to their own country with shame 5 But Joseph took with him two thousand foot soldiers from the king for he desired he might have some assistance in order to force such as were refractory in the cities to pay And bor rowing of the king s friends at Alexandria five hundred talents he made haste back into Syria And when he was at Askelon and demanded the taxes of the people of Askelon they refused to pay any thing and affronted him also upon which he seized upon about twenty of the principal men and slew them and ga thered what they had together and sent it all to the king and informed him what he had done Ptolemy admired the pru dent conduct of the man and commended him for what he had done and gave him leave to do as he pleased When the Sy rians heard of this they were astonished and having before them a sad example in the men of Askelon that were slain they opened their gates and willingly admitted Joseph and paid their taxes And when the inhabitants of Scythopolis attempted to affront him and would not pay him those taxes which they for merly used to pay without disputing about them he slew also the principal men of that city and sent their effects to the king By this means he gathered great wealth together and made vast gains by this farming of the taxes and he made use of what estate he had thus gotten in order to support his authority as thinking it a piece of prudence to keep what had been the oc casion and foundation of his present good fortune and this he did by the assistance of what he was already possessed of for he privately sent many presents to the king and to Cleopatra and to their friends and to all that were powerful about the court and thereby purchased their good will to himself 6 This good fortune he enjoyed for twenty two years and was become the father of seven sons by one wife he had also another son whose name was Hyrcanus by his brother Soly mius daughter whom he married on the following occasion 158 ANTIQUITIES OK THE JEWS Book XII He once came to Alexandria with his brother who had along with him a daughter already marriageable in order to give her in wedlock to some of the Jews of chief dignity there He then supped with the king and falling in love with an actress that was of great beauty and came into the room where they feasted he told his brother of it and entreated him because a Jew is forbidden by their law to come near to a foreigner to conceal his offence and to be kind and subservient to him and to give him an opportunity of fulfilling his desires Upon which his brother willingly entertained the proposal of serving him and adorned his own daughter and brought her to him by night and put her into his bed And Joseph being disordered with drink knew not who she was and so lay with his brother s daughter and this did he many times and loved her exceedingly and said to his brother that he loved this actress so well that he should run the hazard of his life if he must part with her and yet probably the king would not give him leave to take her with him But his brother bid him be in no concern about that matter and told him he might enjoy her whom he loved with out any danger and might have her for his wife and opened the truth of the matter to him and assured him that he chose rather to have his own daughter abused than to overlook him and see him come to public disgrace So Joseph commended him for this his brotherly love and married his daughter and by her begat a son whose name was Hyrcanus as we said before And when this his youngest son showed at thirteen years old a mind that was both courageous and wise and was greatly envied by his brethren as being of a genius much above them and such an one as they might well envy Joseph had once a min d to know which of his sons had the best disposition to virtue and when he sent them severally to those that had then the best reputation for in structing youth the rest of his children by reason of their sloth and unwillingness to take pains returned to him foolish and un learned After them he sent out the youngest Hyrcanus and gave him three hundred yoke of oxen and bid him go two days journey into the wilderness and sow the land there and yet kept back privately the yokes of the oxen that coupled them together When Hyrcanus came to the place and found he had no yokes with him he contemned the drivers of the oxen who advised him to send home to his father to bring them some yokes but he thinking that he ought not to lose his time while they should be sent to bring him the yokes he invented a kind of stratagem and what suited an age older than his own for he slew ten yoke of the oxen and distributed their flesh among the labourers and cut their hides into several pieces and made him yokes and yoked the oxen together with them by which means he sowed Chap IV ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 159 as much land as his father had appointed him to sow and re turned to him And when he was come back his father was mightily pleased with his sagacity and commended the sharp ness of his understanding and his boldness in what he did And he still loved him the more as if he were his only genuine son while his brethren were much troubled at it 7 But when one told him that Ptolemy had a son just born and that all the principal men of Syria and the other countries subject to him were to keep a festival on account of the child s birthday and went away in haste with great retinues to Alex andria he was himself indeed hindered from going by old age but he made trial of his sons whether any of them would be willing to go to the king And when the elder sons excused themselves from going and said they were not courtiers good enough for such conversation and advised him to send their bro ther Hyrcanus he gladly hearkened to that advice and called Hyrcanus and asked him whether he would go to the king and whether it was agreeable to him to go or not And upon his promise that he would go and his saying that he should not want much money for his journey because he would live moderately and that ten thousand drachmae would be sufficient he was plea sed with his son s prudence After a little while the son advised his father not to send his presents to the king from thence but to give him a letter to his steward at Alexandria that he might furnish him with money for purchasing what should be most excellent and most precious So he thinking that the ex pense of ten talents would be enough for presents to be made the king and commending his son as giving him good advice wrote to Arion his steward that managed all his money matters at Alexandria which money was not less than three thousand talents on his account for Joseph sent the money he received in Syria to Alexandria And when the day appointed for the payment of the taxes to the king came he wrote to Arion to pay them So when the son had asked his father for a letter to this steward and had received it he made haste to Alexandria And when he was gone his brethren wrote to all the king s friends that they should destroy him 8 But when he was come to Alexandria he delivered his let ter to Arion who asked him how many talents he would have hoping he would ask for no more than ten or a little more he said he wanted a thousand talents At which the steward was angry and rebuked him as one that intended to live extravagant ly and he let him know how his father had gathered together his estate by pains taking and resisting his inclinations and wished him to imitate the example of his father he assured him withal that he would give him but ten talents and that for a present 160 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XII to the king also The son was irritated at this and threw Arion into prison But when Arion s wife had informed Cleopatra of this with her entreaty that she would rebuke the child for what he had done for Arion was in great esteem with her Cleopatra informed the king of it And Ptolemy sent for Hyr canus and told him that  he wondered when he was sent to him by his father that he had not yet come into his presence but had laid the steward in prison And he gave order therefore that he should come to him and give an account of the reason of what he had done And they report that the an swer he made to the king s messenger was this that  there was a law of his that forbade a child that was born to taste of the sacrifice before he had been at the temple and sacrificed to God According to which way of reasoning he did not himself come to him in expectation of the present he was to make to him as to one who had been his father s benefactor and that he had punished the slave for disobeying his commands for that it mattered not whether a master was little or great so that unless we punish such as these thou thyself mayest also ex pect to be despised by thy subjects Upon hearing this his answer he fell a laughing and wondered at the great soul of the child 9 When Arion was apprized that this was the king s dispo sition and that he had no way to help himself he gave the child a thousand talents and was let out of prison So after three days were over Hyrcanus came and saluted the king and queen They saw him with pleasure and feasted him in an obliging manner out of the respect they bare to his father So he came to the merchants privately and bought a hundred boys that had learning and were in the flower of their ages each at a talent apiece as also he bought a hundred maidens each at the same price as the other And when he was invited to feast with the king among the principal men in the country he sat down the lowest of them all because he was little regarded as a child in age still and this by those who placed every one according to their dignity Now when all those that sat with him had laid the bones of the several parts on a heap before Hyrcanus for they had themselves taken away the flesh belonging to them till the table where he sat was filled full with them Trypho who was the king s jester and wasappointed for jokes and laughter at festivals who was now asked by the guests that sat at the table to expose him to laughter So he stood by the king and said Dost thou not see my Lord the bones that lie by Hyrcanus by this similitude thou mayest conjecture that his father made all Syria as bare as he hath made these bones  And the king laughing at what Trypho said and asking of Hyrcanus How Chap IV ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 161 he came to have so many bones before him he replied Very rightfully my lord for they are dogs that eat the flesh and the bones together as these thy guests have done looking in the mean time at those guests for there is nothing before them but they are men that eat the flesh and cast away the bones as I who am also a man have now done Upon which the king admired at his answer which was so wisely made and bid them all make an acclamation as a mark of their approba tion of his jest which was truly a facetious one On the next day Hyrcanus went to every one of the king s friends and of the men powerful at court and saluted them but still inquired of the servants what present they would make the king on his son s birth day and when some said that they would give twelve talents and that others of greater dignity would every one give according to the quantity of their riches he pretended to every one to be grieved that he was not able to bring so large a present for that he had no more than five ta lents And when the servants heard what he said they told their masters and they rejoiced in the prospect that Joseph would be disapproved and would make the king angry by the smallness of his present When the day came the others even those that brought the most offered the king not above twenty talents but Hyrcanus gave to every one of the hundred boys and hundred maidens that he had bought a talent a piece for them to carry and introduced them the boys to the king and the maidens to Cleopatra every body wondering at the unexpected richness of the presents even the king and queen themselves He also pre sented those that attended about the king with gifts to the value of a great number of talents that he might escape the danger he was in from them for to these it was that Hyrcanus brethren had written to destroy him Now Ptolemy admired at the young man s magnanimity and commanded him to ask what gift he pleased But he desired nothing else to be done for him by the king than to write to his father and brethren about him So when the king had paid him very great respects and had given him very large gifts and had written to his father and his brethren and all his commanders and officers about him he sent him away But when his brethren heard that Hyrca nus had received such favours from the king and was return ing home with great honour they went out to meet him and to destroy him and that with the privity of their father for he was angry at him for the large sum of money that he bestowed for presents and so had no concern for his preservation However Joseph concealed the anger he had at his son out of fear of the king And when Hyrcanus brethren came to fight him he slew many others of those that were with them as also 162 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XII two of his brethren themselves but the rest of them escaped to Jerusalem to their father But when Hyrcanus came to the city where nobody would receive him he was afraid for him self and retired beyond the river Jordan and there abode but obliging the Barbarians to pay their taxes 10 At this time Seleucus who was called Soter reigned over Asia being the son of Antiochus the Great And now Hyr canus father Joseph died He was a good man and of great magnanimity and brought the Jews out of a state of poverty and meanness to one that was more splendid He retained the farm of the taxes of Syria and Phenicia and Samaria twenty two years His uncle also Onias died about this time and left the high priesthood to his son Simeon And when he was dead Onias his son succeeded him in that dignity To him it was that Areus king of the Lacedemonians sent an embassage with an epistle the copy whereof here follows AREUS king of the Lacedemonians to ONIAS sendeth greeting We have met with a certain writing whereby we have discovered that both the Jews and the Lacedemonians are of one stock and are derived from the  kindred of Abraham It is but just therefore that you who are our brethren should send to us about any of your concerns as you please We will also do the same thing and esteem your concerns as our own and will look upon our concerns as in common with yours Demoteles who brings you this letter will bring your answer back to us This letter is foursquare and the seal is an eagle with a dragon in its claws 11 And these were the contents of the epistle which was sent from the king of the Lacedemonians But upon the death of  Whence it comes that these Lacedemonians declare themselves here to be of kin to the Jews as derived from the same ancestor Abraham I cannot tell unless us Grotius supposes they were derived from the Dores that came of the Pelftsgi These are by Herodotus called Barbarians and perhaps were derived from the Syrians and Arabians the posterity of Abraham by Keturah See Antiq B XVI ch x sect 22 Vol II and Of the War B I ch xxvi sect 1 Vol III and Grot on 1 Maccab xii 7 We may farther observe from the recognitions of Cle ment that Eliezer of Damascus the servant of Abraham Gen xv 2 and xxiv waÂ of old by some taken for his son So that if the Lacedemonians were sprung from him they might think themselves to be of the posterity of Abraham as well as the Jews who were sprung from Isaac And perhaps this Eliczur of Damascus is that very Damascus whom Trogus Pompeius as abridged by Justin makes the founder of the Jewish nation itself though he afterwards blunders and makes Azelus Ado res Abraham and Israel kings of Judea and successors to this Damascus It may not be itnproper to observe farther that Moses Chorenensis in his history of the Ar menians informs us that the nation of the Partliians was also derived from Abra ham by Keturah and her children Chap IV ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 163 Joseph the people grew seditious on account of his sons For whereas the elders made war against Hyrcanus who was the youngest of Joseph s sons the multitude was divided but the greater part joined with the elders in this war as did Simon the high priest by reason he was of kin to them However Hyrcanus determined not to return to Jerusalem any more but seated himself beyond Jordan and was at perpetual war with the Arabians and slew many of them and took many of them captives He also erected a strong castle and built it entirely of white stone to the very roof and had ani mals of a prodigious magnitude engraven upon it He also drew round it a great and deep canal of water He also made caves of many furlongs in length by hollowing a rock that was over against him and then he made large rooms in it some for feasting and some for sleeping and living in He introduced also a vast quantity of waters which ran along it and which were very delightful and ornamental in the court But still he made the entrances at the mouth of the caves so narrow that no more than one person could enter by them at once And the reason why he built them after that manner was a good one it was for his own preservation lest he should be besieged by his bre thren and run the hazard of being caught by them Moreover he built courts of greater magnitude than ordinary which he adorned with vastly large gardens And when he had brought the place to this state he named it Tyre This place is between Arabia and Judea beyond Jordan not far from the country of Heshbon And he ruled over those parts for seven years even all the time that Seleucus was king of Syria But when he was dead his brother Antiochus who was called Epiphanes took the kingdom Ptolemy also the king of Egypt died who was besides called Epiphanes He left two sons and both young in age the elder of which was called Philometer and the youngest Physcon As for Hyrcanus when he saw that Antiochus had a great army and feared lest he should be caught by him and brought to punishment for what he had done to the Arabians he ended his life by slaying himself with his own hand while Antiochus seized upon all his substance VOL

pillaged the temple and distressed the Jews As also how many of the Jews forsook the laws of their country and how the Samaritans followed the customs of the Greeks and named their temple at mount Gerizzim the temple of Jupiter Hellenius Â 1 ABOUT this time upon the death of Onias the high priest they gave the high priesthood to Jesus brother tor that son which Onias left or Onias IV was yet but an in fant and in its proper place we will inform the reader of all the circumstances that befell this child But this Jesus who was the brother of Onias was deprived of the high priesthood by the king who was angry with him and gave it to his younger brother whose name also was Onias for Simon had these three sons to each of which the priesthood came as we have  already informed the reader This Jesus changed his name to Jason but Onias was called Menelaus Now as the former high priest Jesus raised a sedition against Menelaus who was ordained after him the multitude were divided between them both And the sons of Tobias took the part of Menelaus but the greater part of the people assisted Jason and by that means Menelaus and the sons of Tobias were distressed and retired to Antiochus and informed him that they were desir ous to leave the laws of their country and the Jewish way of living according to them and to follow the king s laws and the Grecian way of living Wherefore they desired his permission to build them a f Gymnasium at Jerusalem And when he had  We have hitherto had but a few of those many citations where Josephus says that he had elsewhere formerly treated of many things of which yet his present hooks have not a syllable Our commentators have hitherto been able to give no tolerable account of these citations which are far too numerous and that usually in all his copies both Greek and Latin to be supposed later interpolations which is almost all that has been hitherto said upon this occasion What I have to say far ther is this that we have but very few of these references before and very many in and after the history of Antiochus Epiphanes and that Josephus first book the Hebrew or Chaldee as well as the Greek history of the Jewish War long since lost began with that very history so that the references are most probably made to that edition of the seven Books of the War See several other examples besides those in the two sections before us in Antiq B XIII chap ii sect  1 4 vol II and rhap iv sect 6 8 chap v sect 6 11 chap viii sect 4 and chap xiii sect 4 5 and Antiq B XVIII chap ii sect 5 vol III f This word Gymnasium properly denotes a place where the exercises were per formed naked which because it would naturally distinguish circumcised Jews front Chap V ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS given them leave they also hid the circumcision of their geni tals that even when they were naked they might appear to be Greeks Accordingly they left off all the customs that belonged to their own country and imitated the practices of the other nations 2 Now Antiochus upon the agreeable situation of the affairs of his kingdom resolved to make an expedition against Egypt both because he had a desire to gain it and because he contemned the son of Ptolemy as now weak and not yet of abilities to man age affairs of such consequence so he came with great forces to Pelusium and circumvented Ptolemy Philometer by treach ery and seized upon Egypt He then came to the places about Memphis and when he had taken them he made haste to Alexandria in hopes of taking it by siege and of subduing Pto lemy who reigned there But he was driven not only from Alexandria but out of all Egypt by the declarations of the Ro mans who charged him to let that country alone according as I have elsewhere formerly declared I will now give a par ticular account of what concerns this king how he subdued Ju dea and the temple for in my former work I mentioned those things very briefly and have therefore now thought it necessary to go over that history again and that with greater accuracy 3  King Antiochus returning out of Egypt for fear of the Romans made an expedition against the city Jerusalem and when he was there in the hundred forty and third year of the kingdom of the Seleucidae he took the city without fighting those of his own party opening the gates to him And when he had gotten possession of Jerusalem he slew many of the opposite party and when he had plundered it of a great deal of money he returned to Antioch 4 Now it came to pass after two years in the hundred forty and fifth year on the twenty fifth day of that month which is by us called Chasleu and by the Macedonians Apelleus in the hundred and fifty third olympiad that the king came up to Je rusalem and pretending peace he got possession of the city by treachery at which time he spared not so much as those that uncircumcised Gentiles these Jewish apostates endeavoured to appear uncircumcised by means of a ehirurgical operation hinted at by St Paul 1 Cor vii 18 and de scribed by Celsus B VII chap xxv as Dr Hudson here informs us  Hereabouts Josephus begins to follow the first book of the Maccabees a most excellent and most authentic history and accordingly it is here with great fidelity and exactness abridged by him between whose present copies there seem to be fewer variations than in any other sacred Hebrew book of the Old Testament whatsoever for this book also was originally written in Hebrew which it very natural because it was written so much nearer to the times of Josephus than the rest were 166 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XIT admitted him into it on account of the riches that lay in the temple but led by his covetous inclination for he saw there was in it a great deal of gold and many ornaments that had been dedicated to it of very great value and in order to plunder its wealth he ventured to break the league he had made So he left the temple bare and took away the golden candlesticks and the golden altar of incense and table of shew bread and the altar of burnt offering and did not abstain from even the vails which were made of fine linen and scarlet He also emptied it of its secret treasures and left nothing at all remaining and by these means cast the Jews into great lamentation for he forbade them to offer those daily sacrifices which they used to offer to God according to the law And when he had pillaged the whole city some of the inhabitants he slew and some he carried cap tive together with their wives and children so that the multi tude of those captives that were taken alive amounted to about ten thousand He also burnt down the finest buildings and when he had overthrown the city walls he built  a citadel in the lower part of the city for the place was high and over looked the temple on which account he fortified it with high walls and towers and put into it a garrison of Macedonians However in that citadel dwelt the impious and wicked part of the Jewish multitude from whom it proved that the citizens suffered many and sore calamities And when the king had built an idol altar upon God s altar he slew swine upon it and so of fered a sacrifice neither according to the law nor the Jewish re ligious worship in that country He also compelled them to for sake the worship which they paid their own God and to adore those whom he took to be gods and made them build temples and raise idol altars in every city and village and offer swine upon them every day He also commanded them not to cir cumcise their sons and threatened to punish any that should be found to have transgressed his injunctions He also appointed overseers who should compel them to do what he commanded And indeed many Jews there were who complied with the king s commands either voluntarily or out of fear of the penalty that was denounced but the best men and those of the noblest souls did not regard him but did pay a greater respect to the customs  This Citadel of which we have such frequent mention in the following history both in the Maccabees and in Josephus seems to have been a castle built on a hill lower than mount Zion though upon its skirts and higher than mount Mcriah be tween them both which hill the enemies of the Jews now got possession of and built on it this citadel and fortified it till a good while afterwards the Jews regained it and levelled the hill itself with the common ground that their enemies might no more recover it and might thence overlook the temple itself and do them such mischief as they had long undergone from it Antiq B XIII chap vi sect 6 Vol II Chap V ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 167 of their country than concern as to the punishment which he threatened to the disobedient on which account they every day underwent great miseries and bitter torments for they were whipped with rods and their bodies were torn to pieces and were crucified while they were still alive and breathed They also strangled those women and their sons whom they had cir cumcised as the king had appointed hanging their sons about their necks as they were upon the crosses And if there were any sacred book of the law found it was destroyed and those with whom they were found miserably perished also 5 When the Samaritans saw the Jews under these sufferings they no longer confessed that they were of their kindred nor that the temple on mount Gerizzim belonged to Almighty God This was according to their nature as we have already shown And they now said that they were a colony of Medes and Per sians and indeed they were a colony of theirs So they sent ambassadors to Antiochus and an epistle whose contents are these To king Antiochus the god Epiphanes a memorial from the Sidonians who live at Shechem Our forefathers upon certain frequent plagues and as following a certain an cient superstition had a custom of observing that day which by the Jews is called the Sabbath And when they had erected a temple at the mountain called Gerizzim though without a name they offered upon it the proper sacrifices Now upon the just treatment of these wicked Jews those that manage their affairs supposing that we were of kin to them and practised as they do make us liable to the same ac cusations although we be originally Sidonians as is evident from the public records We therefore beseech thee our bene factor and saviour to give order to Appollonius the gover nor of this part of the country and to Nicanor the pro curator of thy affairs to give us no disturbance nor to lay to our charge what the Jews are accused for since we are aliens from their nation and from their customs but let our tem pie which at present hath no name at all be named The temple of Jupiter Hellenius If this were once done we should be no longer disturbed but should be more intent on our own occupation with quietness and so bring in a greater revenue to thee When the Samaritans had petitioned for this the king sent them back the following answer in an epistle  King Antiochus to Nicanor The Sidonians who live at Shechem have sent me the memorial inclosed When therefore we were advising with our friends about it the messengers sent  This allegation of the Samaritans is remarkable that though they were not Jews yet did they from ancient times observe the Sabbath day and as they elsewhere pretend the Sabbatic year also Antiq B XII chap vii sect 6 Vol II 168 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XII by them represented to us that they are no way concerned with accusations which belong to the Jews but choose to live after the customs of the Greeks Accordingly we declare them free from such accusations and order that agreeable to their petition their temple be named The temple of Jupiter Hellenius He also sent the like epistle to Appollonius the governor of that part of the country in the forty sixth year and the eighteenth day of the month Hecatombeon CHAP VI How upon Antiochus prohibition to the Jews to make use of the laws of their country Mattathias the son of Asmoneus alone despised the king and overcame the generals of Antiochus army as also concerning the death of Mattathias and the succession of Judas Â 1 JN ow at this time there was one whose name was Mat tathias who dwelt at Modin the son of John the son of Sim eon the son of Asmoneus a priest of the order of Joarib and a citizen of Jerusalem He had five sons John who was called Gaddis and Simon who was called Matthes and Judas who was called Maccabeus and Eleazar who was called Au ran and Jonathan who was called Apphus Now this Mattathias lamented to his children the sad state of their affairs and the ravage made in the city and the plundering of the temple and the calamities the multitude were under and he told them that it was better for them to die for the laws of their country than to live so ingloriously as they then did 2 But when those that were appointed by the king were come to Modin that they might compel the Jews to do what they were commanded and to enjoin those that were there to offer sacrifice as the king had commanded they desired that Matta thias a person of the greatest character among them both on other accounts and particularly on account of such a numerous and so deserving a family of children would begin the sacrifice because his fellow citizens would follow his example and be cause such a procedure would make him honoured by the king But Mattathias said he would not do it and that if all the  That this appellation of Maccabee was not first of all given to Judas Maccabeus nor was derived from any initial letters of the Hebrew words on his banner Mi Kamoka Be Elim Jehovah Who is like unto tfiee amojig the gods 0 Jehovah Exod xv 11 as the modern Rabbins vainly pretend see Authcnt Rec pan I p 2O5 206 Only we may note by the way that the original name of these Maccabees and their posterity was Asmonians which was derived from Asmoneus the great grandfather of Mattathias as Josephus here informs us Chap VI ANTIgUITIES OF THE JEWS 169 other nations would obey the commands of Antiochus either out of fear or to please him yet would not he nor his sons leave the religious worship of their country But as soon as he had ended his speech there came one of the Jews into the midst of them and sacrificed as Antiochus had commanded At which Mattathias had great indignation and ran upon him vio lently with his sons who had swords with them and slew both the man himself that sacrificed and Apelles the king s general who compelled them to sacrifice with a few of his soldiers He also overthrew the idol altar and cried out If said he any one be zealous for the laws of his country and for the worship of God let him follow me And when he had said this he made haste into the desert with his sons and left all his substance in the village Many others did the same also and fled with their children and wives into the desert and dwelt in caves But when the king s generals heard this they took all the forces they then had in the citadel at Jerusalem and pursued the Jews into the desert and when they had overtaken them they in the first place endeavoured to persuade them to repent and to choose what was most for their advantage and not put them to the necessity of using them according to the law of war But when they would not comply with their persuasions but continued to be of a different mind they fought against them on the Sabbath day and they burnt them as they were in the caves without re sistance and without so much as stoppingup the entrances of the caves And they avoided to defend themselves on that day because they were not willing to break in upon the honour they owed the Sabbath even in such distresses for our law requires that we rest upon that day There were about a thousand with their wives and children who were smothered and died in these caves but many of those that escaped joined themselves to Mat tathias and appointed him to be their ruler who taught them to fight even on the Sabbath day and told them that  unless they would do so they would become their own enemies by observing the law so rigorously while their adversaries would still assault them on this day and they would not then defend themselves and that nothing could then hinder but they must all perish without fighting This speech persuaded them And this rule continues among us to this day that if there be a necessity we may fight on Sabbath days So Mattathias got a great army about him and overthrew their idol altars and slew those that broke the laws even all that he could get under his power for many of them were dispersed among the nations round about them for fear of him He also commanded that those boys which were not yet circumcised should be circumcised now and he drove those away that were appointed to hinder such their circumcision 170 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS BookXJI 3 But when he had ruled one year and was fallen into a dis temper he called for his sons and set them round about him and said  O my sons I am going the way of all the earth and I recommend to you my resolution and beseech you not to be negligent in keeping it but to be mindful of the desires of him who begat you and brought you up and to preserve the cus toms of your country and to recover your ancient form of gov ernment which is in danger of being overturned and not to be carried away with those that either by their own inclina tion or out of necessity betray it but to become such sons as are worthy of me to be above all force and necessity and so to dispose your souls as to be ready when itshall be necessary to die for your laws as sensible of this by just reasoning that if God see that you are so disposed he will not overlook you but will have a great value for your virtue and will restore to you again what you have lost and will return to you that freedom in which you shall live quietly and enjoy your own customs Your bodies are mortal and subject to fate but they receive a sort of immortality by the remembrance of what actions they have done And I would have you so in love with this immortality that you may pursue after glory and that when you have undergone the greatest difficulties you may not scruple for such things to lose your lives 1 exhort you especially to agree one with another and in what excellency any one of you exceeds another to yield to him so far and by that means to reap the advantage of every one s own virtues Do you then esteem Simon as your father because he is a man of extraordinary prudence and to be governed by him in what counsels he gives you Take Maccabeus for the general of your army because of his courage and strength for he will avenge your nation and will bring ven geance on your enemies Admit among you the righteous and religious and augment their power 4 When Mattathias had thus discoursed to his sons and had prayed to God to be their assistant and to recover to the people their former constitution he died a little afterward and was buried at Modin all the people making great lamentation for him Whereupon his son Judas took upon him the administra tion of public affairs in the hundred forty and sixth year and thus by the ready assistance of his brethren and of others Judas cast their enemies out of the country and put those of their own country to death who had transgressed its laws and purified the land of all the pollutions that were in it Chap VII ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 171 CHAP VII How Judas overthrew the forces of Appollonius and Seron and killed the generals of their armies themselves and how when a little while afterward Lysias and Gorgias were beaten he went up to Jerusalem and purified the temple Â 1 VV HEN Appollonius the general of the Samaritan for ces heard this he took his army and made haste to go against Judas who met him and joined battle with him and beat him and slew many of his men and among them Appollonius himself their general whose sword being that which he hap pened to wear he seized upon and kept for himself but he wounded more than he slew and took a great deal of prey from the enemies camp and went his way But when Seron who was general of the army of Celesyria heard that many had join ed themselves to Judas and that he had about him an army suf ficient for fighting and for making war he determined to make an expedition against him as thinking it became him to endea vour to punish those that transgressed the king s injunctions He then got together an army as large as he was able and joined it to the runagate and wicked Jews and came against Judas He came as far as Bethhoron a village of Judea and there pitched his camp upon which Judas met him and when he intended to give him battle he saw that his soldiers were backward to fight because their number was small and because they wanted food for they were fasting he encouraged them and said to them that victory and conquest of enemies is not derived from the mul titude in armies but in the exercise of piety towards God and that they had the plainest instances in their forefathers who by their righteousness and exerting themselves on behalf of their own laws and their own children had frequently con  quered many ten thousands for innocence is the strongest ar my By this speech he induced his men to contemn the mul titude of the enemy and to fall upon Seron And upon joining battle with him he beat the Syrians and when their general fell among the rest they all run away with speed as thinking that to be their best way of escaping So he pursued them un to the plain and slew about eight hundred of the enemy but the rest escaped to the region which lay near to the sea 2 When king Antiochus heard of these things he was very angry at what had happened so he got together all his own ar ny with many mercenaries whom he had hired from the islands and took them with him and prepared to break into Judea about the beginning of the soring But when upon his muster VOL II Y 21 172 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XII ing his soldiers he perceived that his treasures were deficient and there was a want of money in them for all the taxes were not paid by reason of the seditions there had been among the nations he having been so magnanimous and so liberal that what he had was not sufficient for him he therefore resolved first to go into Persia and collect the taxes of that country Hereupon he left one whose name was Lysias who was in great repute with him governor of the kingdom as far as the bounds of Egypt and of the lower Asia and reaching from the river Eu phrates and committed to him a certain part of his forces and of his elephants and charged him to bring up his son Antiochus with all possible care until he came back and that he should conquer Judea and take its inhabitants for slaves and utterly destroy Jerusalem and abolish the whole nation And when king Antiochus had given these things in charge to Lysias he went into Persia and in the hundred and forty seventh year he passed over Euphrates and went to the superior provinces 3 Upon this Lysias chose Ptolemy the son of Dorymenes and Nicanor and Gorgias very potent men among the king s friends and delivered to them forty thousand foot soldiers and seven thousand horsemen and sent them against Judea who came as far as the city Emmaus and pitched their camp in the plain country There came also to them auxiliaries out of Syria and the country round about as also many of the runagate Jews And besides these came some merchants to buy those that should be carried captives having bonds with them to bind those that should be made prisoners with that silver and gold which they were to pay for their price And when Judas saw their camp and how numerous their enemies were he persuaded his own sbldiers to be of good courage and exhorted them to place their hopes of victory in God and to make supplication to him accord ing to the custom of their country clothed in sackcloth and to show what was their usual habit of supplication in the greatest dangers and thereby to prevail with God to grant you the vic tory over your enemies So he set them in their ancient order of battle used by their forefathers under their captains of thou sands and other officers and dismissed such as were newly mar ried as well as those that had newly gained possessions that they might not fight in a cowardly manner out of an inordinate love of life in order to enjoy those blessings When he had thus dis posed his soldiers he encouraged them to fight by the following speech which he made to them O my fellow soldiers no other tune remains more opportune than the present for cou rage and contempt of dangers for if you now fight manfully you may recover your liberty which as it is a tiiing of itself agreeable to all men so it proves to be to us much more Gimp VII ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 173 desirable by its affording us the liberty of worshipping God Since therefore you are in such circumstances at present that you must either recover that liberty and so regain a happy and blessed way of living which is that according to our laws and customs of our country or to submit to the most op probrious sufferings nor will any seed of your nation remain if you be beat in this battle Fight therefore manfully and suppose that you must die though you do not fight But be lieve that besides such glorious rewards as those of the liber ty of your country of your laws of your religion you shall then obtain everlasting glory Prepare yourselves therefore and put yourselves into such an agreeable posture that you may be ready to fight with the enemy as soon as it is day to morrow morning 4 And this was the speech which Judas made to encourage them But when the enemy sent Gorgias with five thousand foot and one thousand horse that he might fall upon Judas by night and had for that purpose certain of the runagate Jews as guides the son of Mattathias perceived it and resolved to fall upon those enemies that were in their camp now their forces were divided When they had therefore supped in good time and had left many fires in their camp he marched all night to those enemies that were at Emmaus so that when Gorgias found no enemy in their camp but suspected that they were re tired and had hidden themselves among the mountains he resol ved to go and seek them wheresoever they were But about break of day Judas appeared to those enemies that were at Em maus with only three thousand men and those ill armed by rea son of their poverty and when he saw the enemy very well and skilfully fortified in their camp he encouraged the Jews and told them that they ought to fight though it were with their naked bodies for that God had sometimes of old given such men strength and that against such as were more in number and were armed also out of regard to their great courage So he commanded the trumpeters to sound for the battle and by thus falling upon the enemies when they did not expect it and thereby astonishing and disturbing their minds he slew many of those that resisted him and went on pursuing the rest as f r as Gadara and the plains of Idumea andAshdod and Jamnia and of these there fell about three thousand Yet did Judas ex hort his soldiers not to be too desirous of the spoils for that still they must have a contest and a battle with Gorgias and the for ces that were with him but that when they had once overcome them then they might securely plunder the camp because they were the only enemies remaining and they expected no others just as he was speaking to his soldiers Gorgias men look 174 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XII ed down into that army which they left in their camp and saw that it was overthrown and the camp burnt for the smoke that arose from it showed them even when they were a great way off what had happened When therefore those that were with Gorgias understood that things were in this posture and per ceived that those that were with Judas were ready to fight them they also were affrighted and put to flight but then Judas as though he had already beaten Gorgias soldiers without fighting returned and seized on the spoils He took a great quantity of gold and silver and purple and blue and then returned home with joy and singing hymns to God for their good success for this victory greatly contributed to the recovery of their liberty 5 Hereupon Lysias was confounded at the defeat of the ar my which he had sent and the next year he got together sixty thousand chosen men He also took five thousand horsemen and fell upon Judea and he went up to the hill country of Beth sur a village of Judea and pitched his camp there where Judas met him with ten thousand men and when he saw the great number of his enemies he prayed to God that he would assist him and joined battle with the first of the enemy that appeared and beat them and slew about five thousand of them and thereby became terrible to the rest of them Nay indeed Lysias observing the great spirit of the Jews how they were prepared to die rather than lose their liberty and being afraid of their desperate way of fighting as if it were real strength he took the rest of the army back with him and returned to Antioch where he listed foreigners into the service and prepared to fall upon Judea with a greater army 6 When therefore the generals of Antiochus armies had been beaten so often Judas assembled the people together and told them That  after these many victories which God had given them they ought to go up to Jerusalem and purify the temple and offer the appointed sacrifices But as soon as he with the whole multitude was come to Jerusalem and found the temple deserted and its gates burnt down and plants grow ing in the temple of their own accord on account of its deser tion he and those that were with him began to lament and were quite confounded at the sight of the temple so he chose out some of his soldiers and gave them order to fight against those guards that were in the citadel until he should have puri fied the temple When therefore he had carefully purged it and had brought in new vessels the candlestick the table of shew bread and the altar of incense which were made of gold he hung up the vails at the gates and added doors to them He also took down the altar of burnt offering and built a new one of stones that he gathered together and not of such as were Chap VIII ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 175 hewn with iron tools So on the five and twentieth day of the month Casleu which the Macedonians call Apelleus they lighted the lamps that were on the candlestick and offered incense upon the altar of incense and laid the loaves upon the table of shew bread and offered burnt offerings upon the new altar of burnt offering Now it so fell out that these things were done on the very same day on which their divine worship had fallen off and was reduced to a profane and common use after three years time for so it was that the temple was made desolate by Antiochus and so continued for three years This desolation happened to the temple in the hundred forty and fifth year on the twenty fifth day of the month Apelleus and on the hundred fifty and third Olympiad but it was dedicated anew on the same day the twenty fifth of the month Apelleus on the hun dred and forty eight year and on the hundred and fifty fourth Olympiad And this declaration came to pass according to the prophecy of Daniel which was given four hundred and eight years before for he declared that the Macedonians would dis solve that worship for some time 7 Now Judas celebrated the festival of the restoration of the sacrifices of the temple for eight days and omitted no sort of pleasures thereon but he feasted them upon very rich and splen did sacrifices and he honoured God and delighted them by hymns and psalms Nay they were so very glad at the revival of their customs when after a long time of intermission they unexpectedly had regained the freedom of their worship that they made it a law for their posterity that they should keep a festival on account of the restoration of their temple worship for eight days And from that time to this we celebrate this festival and call it Lights I suppose the reason was because this liberty beyond our hopes appeared to us and that thence was the name given to the festival Judas also rebuilt the walls round about the city and reared towers of great height against the incursions of enemies and set guards therein He also fortified the city Bethshura that it might serve as a citadel against any distresses that might come from our enemies CHAP VIII Haw Judas subdued the nations round about and how Simon beat the people of Tyre and Ptolemais  and how Judas overcame Timotheus and forced him to jfty away and did many other things after Joseph and Azarias had been beaten  1 THEN these things were over the nations round about the Jews were very uneasy at the revival of their power 176 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Bouk XII and rose up together and destroyed many of them as gaining advantage over them by laying snares for them and making se cret conspiracies against them Judas made perpetual expedi tions against these men and endeavoured to restrain them from those incursions and to prevent the mischiefs they did to the Jews So he fell upon the Idumeans the posterity of Esau at Acrabattene and slew a great many of them and took their spoils He also shut up the sons of Bean that laid wait for the Jews and he sat down about them and besieged them and burnt their towers and destroyed the men that were in them Af ter this he went thence in haste against the Ammonites who had a great and a numerous army of which Timotheus was the commander And when he had subdued them he seized on the city Jazer and took their wives and their children captives and burnt the city and then returned into Judea But when the neighbouring nations understood that he was returned they got together in great numbers in the land of Gilead and came against those Jews that were at their borders who then fled to the garrison of Dametha and sent to Judas to inform him that Timotheus was endeavouring to take the place whither they were fled And as these epistles were reading there came other messengers out of Galilee who informed him that the inhabitants of Ptolemais and of Tyre and Sidon and strangers of Galilee were gotten together 2 Accordingly Judas upon considering what was fit to be done with relation to the necessity both these cases required gave order that Simon his brother should take three thousand chosen men and go to the assistance of the Jews in Galilee whilst he and another of his brothers Jonathan made haste into the land of Gilead with eight thousand soldiers And he left Jo seph the son of Zacharias and Azarius to be over the rest of the forces and charged them to keep Judea very carefully and to fight no battles with any persons whomsoever until his re turn Accordingly Simon went into Galilee and fought the enemy and put them to flight and pursued them to the very gates of Ptolemais and slew about three thousand of them and took the spoils of those that were slain and those Jews whom they had made captives with their baggage and then returned home 3 Now as for Judas Maccabeus and his brother Jonathan they passed over the river Jordan and when they had gone three days journey they light upon the Nabateans who came to meet them peaceably and who told them how the affairs of those in the land of Gilead stood and how many of them were in distress and driven into garrisons and into the cities of Ga lilee and exhorted him to make haste to go against the foreign Chap VIII ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 177 ers and to endeavour to save his own countrymen out of their hands To this exhortation Judas hearkened and returned into the wilderness and in the first place fell upon the inhabitants ot Bosor and took the city and beat the inhabitants and destroyed all the males and all that were able to fight and burnt the city Nor did he stop even when night came on but he journeyed in it to the garrison where the Jews happened to be then shut up and where Timotheus lay round the place with his army and Judas came upon the city in the morning and when he found that the enemy were making an assault upon the walls and that some of them brought ladders on which they might get upon those walls and that others brought engines to batter them he bid the trumpeter to sound his trumpet and he encouraged his soldiers cheerfully to undergo dangers for the sake of their brethren and kindred he also parted his army into three bo dies and fell upon the backs of their enemies But when Ti motheus men perceived that it was Maccabeus that was upon them of both whose courage and good success in war they had formerly had sufficient experience they were put to flight but Judas followed them with his army and slew about eight thou sand of them He then turned aside to a city of the foreigners called Mails and took it and slew all the males and burnt the city itself He then removed from thence and overthrew Cas peom and Bosor and many other cities of the land of Gilead 4 But not long after this Timotheus prepared a great army and took many others as auxiliaries and induced some of the Arabians by the promise of rewards to go with him in this expedition and came with his army beyond the brook over against the city Raphon And he encouraged his soldiers if it came to a battle with the Jews to fight courageously and to hinder their passing over the brook for he said to them before hand That if they come over it we shall be beaten And when Judas heard that Timotheus prepared himself to fight he took all his own army and went in haste against Timotheus his enemy and when he had passed over the brook he fell upon his enemies and some of them met him whom he slew and others of them he so terrified that he compelled them to throw down their arms and fly and some of them escaped but some of them fled to what was called the temple at Carnaim and hoped thereby to preserve themselves but Judas took the city and slew them and burnt the temple and so used several ways of destroying his enemies 5 When he had done this he gathered the Jews together with their children and wives and the substance that belonged to them and was going to bring them back into Judea but as soon as he was come to a certain city whose name was Ephron 178 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XIt that lay upon the road and as it was not possible for him to go any other way so he was not willing to go back again he then sent to the inhabitants and desired that they would open their gates and permit them to go on their way through the city for they had stopped up the gates with stones and cut off their pas sage through it And when the inhabitants of Ephron would not agree to this proposal he encouraged those that were with him and encompassed the city round and besieged it and lying round it by day and night took the city and slew every male in it and burnt it all down and so obtained a way through it and the multitude of those that were slain was so great that they went over the dead bodies So they came over Jordan and ar rived at the great plain over against which is situate the city Bethshan which is called by the Greeks  Scythopolis And going away hastily from thence they came into Judea singing psalms and hymns as they went andindulging such tokens of mirth as are usual in triumphs upon victory They also offered thank offerings both for their good success and for the preservation of their army for f not one of the Jews was slain in these battles 6 But as to Joseph the son of Zacharias and Azarias whom Judas left generals of the rest of the forces at the same time when in Galilee fighting against the people of Ptolemais and Judas himself and his brother Jonathan were in the land of Gi lead did these men also affect the glory of being courageous ge nerals in war in order whereto they took the army that was under their command and came to Jamnia There Gorgias the general of the forces of Jamnia met them and upon joining bat tle with him they lost  two thousand of their army and fled away and were pursued to the very borders of Judea And this misfortune befell them by their disobedience to what injunctions Judas had given them Not to fight with any one before his return For besides the rest of Judas sagacious counsels one  The reason why Betbsban was called Scythopolis is well known from Hero dotus B I p 105 and Syncellus p 214 that the Scythians when they overran Asia in the days of Josiah seized on this city and kept it as long as they continued in Asia from which time it retained the name of Scythopolis or the city of the Scy thians f This roost providential preservation of all the religious Jews in this expedition which was according to the will of God is observable often among God s people the Jews and somewhat very like it in the changes of the four monarchies which were also providential See Prideaux at the years 331 333 and 334  Here is another great instance of providence that when even at the very time that Simon and Judas and Jonathan were so miraculously preserved and blessed in the just defence of their laws and religion these other generals of the Jews who went to fight for honour in a vain glorious way and without any commission from God or the family he had raised up to deliver them were miserably disappoiutcd and defeated See 1 Maccab v 61 62 Chnp IX ANTIQUITIES OF THE JF W8 179 may well wonder at this concerning the misfortune that befell the forces commanded by Joseph and Azarias which he under stood would happen if they broke any of the injunctions he had given them But Judas and his brethren did not leave off fight ing with the Idumeans but pressed upon them on all sides and took from them the city of Hebron and demolished all its forti fications and set all its towers on fire and burnt the country of the foreigners and the city Marissa They came also to Ash dod and took it and laid it waste and took away a great deal of the spoils and prey that were in it and returned to Judea CHAP IX Concerning the death of Antiochus Epiphanes How Antiochus Eupator fought against Judas and besieged him in the temple and afterwards made peace with him and departed Of Alci mus and Onias Â 1 ABOUT this time it was that king Antiochus as he was going over the upper countries heard that there was a very rich city in Persia called Etymais  and therein a very rich temple of Diana and that it was full of all sorts of donations dedicated to it as also weapons and breastplates which upon inquiry he found had been left there by Alexander the son of Philip king of Macedonia And being incited by these motives he went in haste to Elymais and assaulted it and besieged it But as those that were in it were not terrified at his assault nor at his siege but opposed him very courageously he was beaten off his hopes for they drove him away from the city and went out and pursued after him insomuch that he fled away as far as Babylon and lost a great many of his army And when he was grieving for this disappointment some persons told him of the defeat of his commanders whom he had left behind him to fight against Judea and what strength the Jews had already gotten When this concern about these affairs was added to the former he was confounded and by the anxiety he was in fell into a distemper which as it lasted a great while and as his pains increased upon him so he at length perceived he should die in a little time so he called his friends to him and told them thathisdistemperwas severe upon him and confessed with al that this calamity was sent upon him for the miseries he had brought upon the Jewish nation while he plundered their tem ple and contemned their God and when he had said this he gave up the ghost Whence one may wonder at Polybius of Megalopolis who though otherwise a good man yet saith That  Antiochus died because he had a purpose to plunder VOL n z 21 180 ANTIQUITIES Ol THE JKWS Book XII the temple of Diana in Persia for the  purposing to do a thing but not actually doing it is not worthy of punishment But if Polybius could think that Antiochus thus lost his life on that account it is much more probable that this king died on account of his sacrilegious plundering of the temple at Jeru salem But we will not contend about this matter with those who may think that the cause assigned by this Polybius of Megalopolis is nearer the truth than that assigned by us 2 However Antiochus before he died called tor Philip who was one of his companions and made him the guardian of his kingdom and gave him his diadem and his garment and his ring and charged him to carry them and deliver them to his son Antiochus and desired him to take care of his educa tion and to preserve the kingdom for him f This Antiochus died in the hundred forty and ninth year But it was Lysias that declared his death to the multitude and appointed his son Antiochus to be king of whom at present he had the care and called him Eupator 3 At this time it was that the garrison in the citadel at Jeru salem with the Jewish runagates did a great deal of harm to the Jews for the soldiers that were in that garrison rushed out upon the sudden and destroyed such as were going up to the temple in order to offer their sacrifices for this citadel adjoined to and overlooked the temple When these misfortunes had often hap pened to them Judas resolved to destroy that garrison where upon he got all the people together and vigorously besieged those that were in the citadel This was in the hundred and fiftieth year of the dominion of the Seleucidae So he made en gines of war and erected bulwarks and very zealously pressed on to take the citadel But there were not a few of the runa gates who were in the place that went out by night into the country and got together some other wicked men like them selves and went to Antiochus the king and desired of him That he would not suffer them to be neglected under the great hardships that lay upon them from those of their own  Since St Paul a Pharisee confesses that he had not known concvpitcence 01 tesircs to be sinful had not the tenth commandment said Thou shalt not covet Rom vii 7 the case seems to have been much the same with our Josephus who was of the same sect that he had not a deep sense of the greatness of any sins that proceeded no farther than the intention However since Joaepbus speaks here pro perly uf the punishment of death which is Dot inflicted by any law either of God or man for the bare intention his words need not to be strained to mean that sins in tended but not executed were no sins at all  No wonder that Josephus here describes Antiochus Eupator as young and wanting tuition when he came to the crown since Appian informs us Syriae p 177 that he was then but nine years old IX ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 181 nation and this because their sufferings were occasioned on his father s account while they left the religious worship of their fathers and preferred that which he had commanded them to follow that there was danger lest the citadel and those appointed to garrison it by the king should be taken by Judas and those that were with him unless he would send them succours When Antiochus who was but a child heard this he was angry and sent for his captains and his friends and gave order that they should get an army of mercenaries together with such men also of his own kingdom as were of any age fit for war Accordingly an army was col lected of about a hundred thousand footmen and twenty thou sand horsemen and thirty two elephants 4 So the king took his army and marched hastily out of Antioch with Lysias who had the command of the whole and came to Idumea and thence went up to the city Bethsura a city that was strong and not to be taken without great difficulty be set about this city and besieged it And while the inhabitants of Bethsura courageously opposed him and sallied out upon him and burnt his engines of war a great deal of time was spent in the siege But when Judas heard of the king s coming he raised the siege of the citadel and met the king and pitched his camp in certain straits at a place called Bethzachariah at the distance of seventy furlongs from the enemy but the king soon drew his forces from Bethsura and brought them to those straits And as soon as it was day he put his men in battle array and made his elephants follow one another through the narrow passes because they could not be set sideways by one another Now round about every elephant there were a thousand footmen and five hundred horsemen The elephants also had high towers upon their backs and archers in them And he also made the rest of his army to go up the mountains and put his friends before the rest and gave orders for the army to shout aloud and so he attacked the enemy He also exposed to sight their golden and brazen shields so that a glorious splendour was sent from them and when they shouted the mountains echoed again When Judas saw this he was not terrified but received we enemy with great courage and slew about six hundred of the first ranks But when his brother Eleazar whom they called Auran saw the tallest of the elephants armed with royal breast plates and supposed that the king was upon him he at tacked him with great quickness and bravery He also slew Many of those that were about the elephant and scattered the rest and then went under the belly of the elephant and smote torn and slew him so the elephant fell upon Eleazar and by iiis weight crushed him to death And thus did this man come 182 ANTICJUITJES or THE JEWS Book XII to his end when he had first courageously destroyed many of his enemies 5 But Judas seeing the strength of the enemy retired to Je rusalem and prepared to endure a siege As for Antiochus he sent part of his army to Bethsura to besiege it and with the rest of his army he came against Jerusalem but the inhabitants of Bethsura were terrified at his strength and seeing that their provisions grew scarce they delivered themselves up on the se curity of oaths that they should suffer no hard treatment from the king And when Antiochus had thus taken the city he did them no other harm than sending them out naked He also placed a garrison of his own in the city But as for the temple of Jerusalem he lay at its siege a long time while they within bravely defended it for what engines soever the king set against them they set other engines again to oppose them But then their provisions failed them what fruits of the ground they had laid up were spent and the land being not ploughed that year continued unsowed because it was the seventh year on which by our laws we are obliged to let it lie uncultivated And withal so many of the besieged ran away for want of necessaries that but a few only were left in the temple 6 And these happened to be the circumstances of such as were besieged in the temple But then because Lysias the general of the army and Antiochus the king were informed that Philip was coming upon them out of Persia and was en deavouring to get the management of public affairs to himself they came into these sentiments to leave the siege and to make haste to go again to Philip yet did they resolve not to let this be known to the soldiers nor to the officers But the king com manded Lysias to speak openly to their soldiers and the officers without saying a word about the business of Philip and to in timate to them that the siege would be very long that the place was very strong that they were already in want of pro visions that many affairs of the kingdom wanted regulation and that it was much better to make a league with the besieged and to become friends to their whole nation by permitting them to observe the laws of their fathers while they broke out into this war only because they were deprived of them and so to de part home When Lysias had discoursed thus to them both the army and the officers were pleased with this resolution 7 Accordingly the king sent to Judas and to those that were besieged with them and promised to give them peace and to permit them to make use of and live according to the laws of their fathers And they gladly received his proposals and when they had gained security upon oath for their perform ance they went out of the temple But when Antiochus came Chap X ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 1 S3 into it and saw how strong the place was he broke his oaths and ordered his army that was there to pluck down the walls to the ground and when he had so done he returned to An tioch he also carried with him Onias the high priest who was also called Menelaus for Lysias advised the king to slay Mene laus if he would have the Jews be quiet and cause him no farther disturbance for that this man was the origin of all the mischief the Jews had done them by persuading his father to compel the Jews to leave the religion of their fathers So the king sent Menelaus to Berea a city of Syria and there had him put to death when he had been high priest ten years He had been a wicked and an impious man and in order to get the go vernment to himself had compelled his nation to transgress their own laws After the death of Menelaus Alcimus who was also called Jacimus was made high priest But when king An tiochus found that Philip had already possessed himself of the government he made war against him and subdued him and took him and slew him Now as to Onias the son of the high priest who as we before informed you was left a child when his father died when he saw that the king had slain his uncle Menelaus and given the high priesthood to Alcimus who was not of the high priest stock but as induced by Lysias to translate that dignity from this family to another house he fled to Ptole my king of Egypt and when he found he was in great esteem with him and with his wife Cleopatra he desired and obtained a place in the Nomus of Heliopolis wherein he built a temple like to that at Jerusalem of which therefore we shall hereafter give an account in a place more proper for it CHAP X How Bacchides the general of Demetrius army made an expe dition against Judea and returned without success and haw Nicanor was sent a little afterward against Judas andperish ed together with his army  as also concerning the death of Al cimus and the succession of Judas Â 1 ABOUT the same time Demetrius the son of Seleucus fled away from Rome and took Tripoli a city of Syria and set the diadem on his own head He also gathered certain mercenary soldiers together and entered into his kingdom and was joyfully received by all who delivered themselves up to him And when they had taken Antiochus the king and Lysias they brought them to him alive both which were immediately put to death by the command of Demetrius when Antiochus had reigned two years as we have already elsewhere related But there were now many of the wicked Jewish runagates that came 184 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XII together to him and with them Alcimus the high priest who accused the whole nation and particularly Judas and his breth ren and said That  they had slain all his friends and that those in his kingdom that were of his party and waited for his return were by them put to death that these men had ejected them out of their own country and caused them to be sojourners in a foreign land and they desired that he would send some one of his own friends and know from him what mischief Judas party had done 2 At this Demetrius was very angry and stnt Bacchides a friend of Antiochus Epiphanes  a good man and one that had been entrusted with all Mesopotamia and gave him an army and committed Alcimus the high priest to his care and gave him charge to slay Judas and those that were with him So Bacchides made haste and went out of Antioch with his army and when he was come into Judea he sent to Judas and his breth ren to discourse with him about a league of friendship and peace for he had a mind to take him by treachery But Judas did not give credit to him for he saw that he came with so great an army as men do not bring when they come to make peace but to make war However some of the people acqui esced in that Bacchides caused to be proclaimed and supposing they should undergo no considerable harm from Alcimus who was their countryman they went over to them and when they had received oaths from both of them that neither they them selves nor those of the same sentiments should come to any harm they entrusted themselves with them But Bacchides troubled himself not about the oaths he had taken and slew threescore of them although by not keeping his faith with these that first went over he deterred all the rest who had intentions to go over to him from doing it But as he was gone out of Jerusalem and was at the village called Bethzetha he sent out and caught many of the deserters and some of the people also and slew them all and enjoined all that lived in the country to submit to AJcimus So he left him there with some part of the army that he might have wherewith to keep the country in obedience and returned to Antioch to king Demetrius 3 But Alcimus was desirous to have the dominion more firm ly assured to him and understanding that if he could bring it about that the multitude should be his friends he should govern  It is no way probable that Josephus would call Bacchides that bitter and bloody enemy of the Jews as our present copies have it a good man or kind and gentle What the author of the first book of Maccabees whom Josephus here follows in stead of that character says of him is that he was a great man in the kingdom and faitltful to his ting which was very probably Josephus meaning also Chap X ANTIQUITIES Of THE JEWS 185 with greater security he spake kind words to them all and dis coursed to each of them after an agreeable and pleasant manner by which means he quickly had a great body of men and an army about him although the greater part of them were of the wicked and the deserters With these whom he used as his servants and soldiers he went all over the country and slew all that he could find of Judas party But when Judas saw that Alcimus was already become great and had destroyed many of the good and holy men of the country he also went all over the country and destroyed those that were of the other s party But when Alcimus saw that he was not able to oppose Judas nor was equal to him in strength he resolved to apply himself to king Demetrius for his assistance so he came to Antioch and irritated him against Judas and accused him alleging that he had undergone a great many miseries by his means and that he would do more mischief unless he were prevented and brought to punishment which must be done by sending a powerful force against him 4 So Demetrius being already of opinion that it would be a thing pernicious to his own affairs to overlook Judas now he was becoming so great sent against him Nicanor the most kind and most faithful of all his friends for he it was who fled away with him from the city of Rome He also gave him as many forces as he thought sufficient for him to conquer Judas withal and bid him not to spare the nation at all When Nicanor was come to Jerusalem he did not resolve to fight Judas immediately but judged it better to get him into his power by treachery so he sent him a message of peace and said there was no manner of necessity for them to fight and hazard themselves and that he would give him his oath that he would do him no harm for that he only came with some friends in order to let him know what king Demetrius intentions were and what opin ion he had of their nation When Nicanor had delivered this message Judas and his brethren complied with him and sus pecting no deceit they gave him assurances of friendship and re ceived Nicanor and his army  but while he was saluting Judas and they were talking together he gave a certain signal to his own soldiers upon which they were to seize upon Judas but he per ceived the treachery and ran back to his own soldiers and fled away with them So upon this discovery of his purpose and of the snares laid for Judas Nicanor determined to make open war with him and gathered his army together and prepared for fighting him and upon joining battle with him at a certain vil lage called Capharsalama he  beat Judas and forced him to fly to that citadel which was at Jerusalem  Joscphus copies must havÂ bÂ Â n corrupted when they her give victory to Ni 186 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XII 5 And when Nicanor came down from the citadel unto the temple some of the priests and elders met him and saluted him and showed him the sacrifices which they said they of fered to God for the king upon which he blasphemed and threatened them that unless the people would deliver up Judas to him upon his return he would pull down their temple And when he had thus threatened them he departed from Je rusalem But the priests fell into tears out of grief of what he had said and besought God to deliver them from their ene mies But now for Nicanor when he was gone out of Je rusalem and was at a certain village called Bethhoron he there pitched his camp another army out of Syria having joined him And Judas pitched his camp at Adasa another village which was thirty furlongs distant from Bethhoron having no more than one thousand soldiers And when he had encour aged them not to be dismayed at the multitude of their enemies nor to regard how many they were against whom they were go ing to fight but to consider who they themselves were and for what great rewards they hazarded themselves and to attack the enemy courageously he led them out to fight and joining bat tle with Nicanor which proved to be a severe one he overcame the enemy and slew many of them and at last Nicanor himself as he was fighting gloriously fell Upon whose fall the army did not stay but when they had lost their general they were put to flight and threw down their arms Judas also pursued them and slew them and gave notice by the sound of the trumpets to the neighbouring villages that he had conquered the enemy which when the inhabitants heard they put on their armour hastily and met their enemies in the face as they were running away and slew them insomuch that not one of them escaped out of this battle and were in number nine thousand This victory happened to fall on the thirteenth day of that month which by the Jews is called Adar and the Macedonians Dystrus and the Jews thereon celebrate this victory every year and esteem it as a festival day After which the Jewish nation were for a while free from wars and enjoyed peace but afterward they returned into their former state of wars and hazards 6 But now as the high priest Alcimus was resolving to pull down the wall of the sanctuary which had been there of old time cnnor contrary to the words following which imply that he who was beaten fled in to he citadel which for certain belonged to the city of David or to Mount Zion and was in the possession of Nicanor s garrison and not of Judas As also it is contrary to the express words of Josephus original author 1 Mac nib vii 32 who says that Nicanor lost about 500O men and fled to the city of David Chap X ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 187 and had been built by the holy prophets  he was smitten sud denly by God and fell dqwn This stroke made him fall down speechless upon the ground and undergoing torments for many days he at length died when he had been high priest four years And when he was dead the people bestowed the high priesthood on Judas who hearing of the power f of the Romans and that they had conquered in war Galatia and Iberia and Carthage and Lybia and that besides these they had subdued Greece and their kings Perseus and Philip and Antiochus the Great also he resolved to eater into a league of friendship with them He therefore sent to Rome some of his friends Eupolemus the son of John and Jason the son of Eleazar and by them desired the Romans that they would assist them and be their friends and would write to Demetrius that he would not fight against the Jews So the senate received the ambassadors that came from Judas to Rome and discoursed with them about the errand on which they came and then granted them a league of assistance They also made a decree concerning it and sent a copy of it into Judea It was also laid up in the capitol and engraven in brass The decree itself was this The decree of the senate concerning a league of assistance and friendship with the na tion of the Jews It shall not be lawful for any that are sub ject to the Romans to make war with the nation of the Jews nor to assist those that do so either by sending them corn or ships or money and if any attack be made upon the Jews the Romans shall assist them as far as they are able and again if any attack be made upon the Romans the Jews shall assist them And if the Jews had o mind to add to or to take away any thing from this league of assistance that shall be done with the common consent of the Romans And what soever addition shall thus be made it shall be of force This decree was written by Eupolemus the son of John and by Ja son the son of Eleazar  when Judas was high priest of the na Â This account of the miserable death of Alcimus or Jaclmus the wicked high priest the first that was not of the family of the high priests and made by a vile heathen Lysias before the death of Judas and of Judas succession to him as a high priest both here and at the conclusion of this book directly contradicts 1 Maccab ix 34â 57 which places his death after the death of Judas and says not a syllable of the high priesthood of Judas  How well the Koman histories agree to this Bccouot of me conquests an powerful condition of the Romans at this time see the notes in Havercamp s edi tion only that the number of the senators of Rome was then just 32P is I think only known from 1 Maccab viii 15 J This subscription is wanting 1 Maccab viii 17 19 and must be the words of Josephus who by mistake thought as we have just now seen that Judas was at this time high priest and accordingly then reckoned his brother Jonathan to be the general of the army which yet he seems not to have been till after the death of Judas VOL II A j 2t 188 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XII don and Simon his brother was general of the army And this was the first league that the Romans made with the Jews and was managed after this manner CHAP XI  That Bacchides was again sent out agaqist Judas  and how Judas Jell as he was courageously Jighting Â 1 XJUT when Demetrius was informed of the death of Ni canor and of the destruction of the army that was with him he sent Bacchides again with an army into Judea who marched out of Antioch and came into Judea and pitched his camp at Arbela a city of Galilee and having besieged and taken those that were there in caves for many of the people fled into such places he removed and made all the haste he could to Jerusa lem And when he had learned that Judas pitched his camp at a certain village whose name was Bethzetho he led his army against him they were twenty thousand footmen and two thousand horsemen Now Judas had no more soldiers than  one thousand When these saw the multitude of Bacchides men they were afraid and left their camp and fled all away excepting eight hundred Now when Judas was deserted by his own sol diers and the enemy pressed upon him and gave him no time to Â ather his army together he was disposed to fight with Bacchi es army though he had but eight hundred men with him so he exhorted these men to undergo the danger courageously and encouraged them to attack the enemy And when they said they were not a body sufficient to fight so great an army and advised that they should retire now and save themselves and that when he had gathered his own men together then he should fall upon the enemy afterwards his answer was this Let not the sun ever see such a thing that I should show my back to the ene my and although this be the time that will bring me to my end and I must die in this battle I will rather stand to it cou rageously and bear whatsoever comes upon me than by now running away bring reproach upon my former great actions  or tarnish their glory This was the speech he made to those that remained with him whereby he encouraged them to attack the enemy 2 But Bacchides drew his army out of their camp and put  That this copy of Josephus as he wrote it had here not 100O but 3000 with 1 Maccab ix 5 is very plain because though the main part ran away at first even in Josephus as welt as in 1 Maccab ix 6 yet as there so here 8OO are said to have remained with Judas which would be absurd if the whole number had been no mote than 1000 Chap XI  ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 189 them in array for the battle He set the horsemen on both the wings and the light soldiers and the archers he placed before the whole army but he was himself on the right wing And when he had thus put his army in order of battle and was going to join battle with the enemy he commanded the trumpeter to give a signal of battle and the army to make a shout and to fall on the enemy And when Judas had done the same he joined battle with them and as both sides fought valiantly and the battle continued till sunset Judas saw that Bacchides and the strongest part of the army was in the right wing and thereupon took the most courageous men with him and ran upon that part of the army and fell upon those that were there and broke their ranks and drove them into the middle and forced them to run away and pursued them as far as a mountain called Aza but when those of the left wing saw that the right wing was put to flight they encompassed Judas and pursued him and came be hind him and took him into the middle of their army so being not able to fly but encompassed round about with enemies he stood still and he and those that were with him fought and when he had slain a great many of those that came against him he at last was himself wounded and fell and gave up the ghost and died in a way like to his former famous actions When Judas was dead those that were with him had no one whom they could regard as their commander but when they saw themselves deprived of such a general they fled But Si mon and Jonathan Judas brethren received his dead body by a treaty from the enemy and carried it to the village of Modin where their father had been buried and there buried him while the multitude lamented him many days and performed the usual solemn rites of a funeral to him And this was the end that Judas came to He had been a man of valour and a great war rior and mindful of the commands of his father Mattathias and had undergone all difficulties both in doing and suffering for the liberty of his countrymen And when his charactei was so excellent while he was alive he left behind him a glo rious reputation and memorial by gaining freedom for his na tion and delivering them from slavery under the Macedonians And when he had retained the high priesthood three years he died 190 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS BookXIIL BOOK XIII CONTAINING THE INTERVAL oi EIGHTY TWO YEAH FROM THE DEATH OF JUDAS MACCABEES TO THE DEATH OF QUEEN ALEXANDRA CHAP I Hem Jonathan took the government after his brother Judas and hchsi he together with his brother Simon imaged siar against Baechides Â 1 BY what means the nation of the Jews recovered their freedom when they had been brought into slavery by the Ma cedonians and what struggles and how great battles Judas the feneral of their army rail through till he was slain as he was ghting for them hath been related in the foregoing book but after he was dead all the wicked and those that transgressed the laws of their forefathers sprang up again in Judea and grew upon them and distressed them on every side A famine also assisted their wickedness and afflicted the country till not a few who by reason of their want of necessaries and because they were not able to bear up the miseries that both the famine and their enemies brought upon them deserted their country and went to the Macedonians And now Bacchides gathered those Jews together who had apostatized from the accustomed way of living of their forefathers and chose to live like their neighbours and committed the care of the country to them who also caught the friends of Judas and those of his party and delivered them up to Bacchides who when he had in the first place tortured and tormented them at his pleasure he by that means at length killed them And when this calamity of the Jews was become so great as they had never had expe rience of the like since their return out of Babylon those that remained of the companions of Judas seeing that the nation was ready to be destroyed after a miserable manner came to his brother Jonathan and desired him that he would imitate hiÂ brother and that care which he took of his countrymen for whose liberty in general he died also and that he would not permit the nation to be without a governor especially in those destructive circumstances wherein it now was And when Jon Chap I ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 191 athan said that he was ready to die for them and was indeed esteemed no way inferior to his brother he was appointed to be the general of the Jewish army 2 When Bacchides heard this he was afraid that Jonathan might be very troublesome to the king and the Macedonians as Judas had been before him he sought how he might slay him by treachery But this invention of his was not unknown to Jona than nor to his brother Simon but when these two were ap prized of it they took all their companions and presently fled into that wilderness which was nearest to the city and when they were come to a lake called Asphar they abode there But when Bacchides was sensible that they were in a low state and were in that place he hasted to fall upon them with all his for ces and pitching his camp beyond Jordan he recruited his ar my But when Jonathan knew that Bacchides was coming upon him he sent his brother John who was also called Gaddis to the Nabatean Arabs that he might lodge his baggage with them until the battle with Bacchides should be over for they were the Jews friends And the sons of Ambri laid an ambush for John from the city Medaba and seized upon him and upon those that were with him and plundered all that they had with them  They also slew John and all his companions However they were sufficiently punished for what they now did by John s brethren as we shall relate presently 3 But when Bacchides knew that Jonathan had pitched his camp among the lakes of Jordan he observed when their Sab bath day came and then assaulted him as supposing that he would not fight because of the law for resting on that day but he exhorted his companions to fight and told them that their lives were at stake since they were encompassed by the river and by their enemies and had no way to escape for that their enemies pressed upon them before and the river was behind them So after he had prayed to God to give them the victory he joined battle with the enemy of whom he overthrew many and as he saw Bacchides coming up boldly to him he stretched out his right hand to smite him but the other foreseeing and avoiding the stroke Jonathan with his companions leaped into the river and swam over it and by that means escaped beyond Jordan while the enemy did not pass over that river but Bac chides returned presently to the citadel at Jerusalem having lost about two thousand of his army He also fortified many cities of Judea whose walls had been demolished Jericho and Em maus and Bethoron and Bethel and Tirana and Pharatho and Tekoa and Gazara and built towers in every one of these cities and encompassed them with strong walls that were very large also and put garrisons into them that they might issue 192 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XIII out of them and do mischief to the Jews He also fortified the citadel at Jerusalem more than all the rest Moreover he took the sons of the principal Jews as pledges and shut them up in the citadel and in that manner guarded it 4 About the same time one came to Jonathan and to his brother Simon and told them that the sons of Ambri were celebrating a marriage and bringing the bride from the city Gabatha who was the daughter of one of the illustrious men among the Arabians and that the damsel was to be conducted with pomp and splendour and much riches So Jonathan and Simon thinking this appeared to be the fittest time for them to avenge the death of their brother and that they had forces suf ficient for receiving satisfaction from them for his death they made haste to Medaba and lay in wait among the mountains for the coming of their enemies and as soon as they saw them con ducting the virgin and her bridegroom and such a great com pany of their friends with them as was to be expected at this wedding they sallied out of their ambush and slew them all and took their ornaments and all the prey that then followed them and so returned and received this satisfaction for their brother John from the sons of Ambri for as well those sons themselves as their friends and wives and children that fol lowed them perished being in number about four hundred 5 However Simon and Jonathan returned to the lakes of the river and abode there But Bacchides when he had secur ed all Judea with his garrisons returned to the king and then it was that the affairs of Judea were quiet for two years But when the deserters and the wicked saw that Jonathan and those that were with him lived in the country very quietly by rea son of the peace they sent to king Demetrius and excited him to send Bacchides to seize upon Jonathan which they said was to be done without any trouble and in one night s time and that if they fell upon them before they were aware they might slay them all So the king sent Bacchides who when he was come into Judea wrote to all his friends both Jews and aux iliaries that they should seize upon Jonathan and bring him to him and when upon all their endeavours they were not able to seize upon Jonathan for he was sensible of the snares they laid for him and very carefully guarded against them Bacchides was angry at these deserters as having imposed upon him and upon the king and slew fifty of their leaders Whereupon Jona than with his brother and those that were with them retired to Bethagla a village that lay in the wilderness out of his fear of Bacchides He also built towers on it and encompassed it with walls and took care that it should be safely guarded Upon the hearing of which Bacchidw ed his own army along with Chap II ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 193 him and besides took his Jewish auxiliaries and came against Jonathan and made an assault upon his fortifications and be sieged him many days but Jonathan did not abate of his cour age at the zeal Bacchides used in the siege but courageously opposed him And while he left his brother Simon in the city to fight with Bacchides he went privately out himself into the country and got a great body of men together of his own party and fell upon Bacchides camp in the night time and destroyed a great many of them His brother Simon knew also of this his falling upon them because he perceived that the enemies were slain by him so he sallied out upon them and burnt the engines which the Macedonians used and made a great slaugh ter of them And when Bacchides saw himself encompassed with enemies and some of them before and some behind him he fell into despair and trouble of mind as confounded at the unexpected ill success of this siege However he vented his displeasure at these misfortunes upon those deserters who sent for him from the king as having deluded him So he had a mind to finish this siege after a decent manner if it were possi ble for him so to do and then to return home 6 When Jonathan understood these his intentions he sent am bassadors to him about a league of friendship and mutual assist ance and that they might restore those they had taken captive on both sides So Bacchides thought this a pretty decent way of retiring home and made a league of friendship with Jona than when they sware that they would not any more make war one against another Accordingly he restored the captives and took his own men with him and returned to the king of An tioch and after this his departure he never came into Judea again Then did Jonathan take the opportunity of this quiet state of things and went and lived in the city Michmash and there governed the multitude and punished the wicked and ungodly and by that means pu rged the nation of them CHAP II How Alexander Bala in his war with Demetrius granted Jo nathan many advantages and appointed him to be high priest and persuaded him to assist him although Demetrius promised him greater advantages on the other side Concerning the death of Demetrius Â 1 Now in the hundred and sixtieth year it fell out that Alexander the  son of Antiochus Epiphanes came up into  This Alexander Bala who certainly pretended to be the son of Antiochus Epiphanes and was owned for such by the Jews and Romans and many others 194 iNTiyuiTiEs OF THE JEWS Book XIII Syria and took Ptolemais the soldiers within having betray ed it to him for they were at enmity with Demetrius on ac count of his insolence and difficulty of access for he shut him self up in a palace of his that had four towers which he had built himself not far from Antioch and admitted nobody He was withal slothful and negligent about the public affairs where by the hatred of his subjects was the more kindled against him as we have elsewhere already related When therefore Deme trius heard tkat Alexander was in Jftolemais he took his whole army and led it against him he also sent ambassadors to Jona than about a league of mutual assistance and friendship for he resolved to be beforehand witii Alexander lest the other should treat with him first and gain assistance from him And this he did out of the fear he had lest Jonathan should remember how ill Demetrius had formerly treated him and should join with him in this war against him He therefore gave orders that Jonathan should be allowed to raise an army and should get ar mour made and should receive back those hostages of the Jewish nation whom Bacchides had shut up in the citadel of Jerusalem When this good fortune had befallen Jonathan by the concession of Demetrius he came to Jerusalem and read tne kmg s letter in the audience of the people and of those that kept the citadel When these were read these wicked men and deserters who were in the citadel were greatly afraid upon the king s per mission to Jonathan to raise an army and to receive back the hostages So he delivered every one of them to his own pa rents And thus did Jonathan make his abode at Jerusalem renewing the city to a better state and reforming the buildings as he pleased for he gave orders that the walls of the city should be rebuilt with square stones that it might be more se cure from their enemies And when those that kept the garri sons that were in Judea saw this they all left them and fled to Antioch excepting those that were in the city of Bethsura and those that were in the citadel of Jerusalem for the greater part of these was of the wicked Jews and deserters and on that ac count these did not deliver up their garrisons 2 When Alexander knew what promises Demetrius had yet is by several historians deemed to be a counterfeit and of no family at all is however by Josephus believed to have been the real son of that Antiochus and by him always spoken of accordingly And truly since the original cotemporary and authentic author of the first book of Maccab ch x 1 calls him by his father s name Epiphanes and says he was the son of Antiochus I suppose the other writers who are all much later are not to be followed against such evidence though perhaps Epiphanes might have him by a woman of no family The king of Egypt also Philometer soon gave him his daughter in marriage which he would hardly have done had he believed him to be a counterfeit and of so very mean a birth as the later historians pretend Chap II ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 195 made Jonathan and withal knew his courage and what great things he had done when he fought the Macedonians and be sides what hardships he had undergone by the means of Deme trius and of Bacchides the general of Demetrius army he told his friends That  he could not at present find any one else that might afford him better assistance than Jonathan who was both courageous against his enemies and had a particular hatred against Demetrius as having both suffered many hard things from him and acted many hard things against him If therefore they were of opinion that they should make him their friend against Demetrius it was more for their advan tage to invite him to assist them now than at another time It being therefore determined by him and his friends to send to Jonathan he wrote to him this epistle King Alexander to his brother Jonathan sendeth greeting We have long ago heard of thy courage and thy fidelity and for that reason have sent to thee to make with thee a league of friendship and mutual assistance We therefore do ordain thee this day  the high priest of the Jews and that thou beest called my friend I have also sent thee as presents a purple robe and a golden crown and desire that now thou art by us honoured thou wilt in like manner respect us also 3 When Jonathan had received this letter he  put on the pontifical robe at the time of the feast of tabernacles four years after the death of his brother Judas for at that time no high priest had been made So he raised great forces and had abun dance of armour got ready This greatly grieved Demetrius when he heard of it and made him blame himself for his slow ness that he had not prevented Alexander and got the good will of Jonathan but had given him time so to do However he also himself wrote a letter to Jonathan and to the people the contents whereof are these King Demetrius to Jonathan and to the nation of the Jews sendeth greeting Since you have preserved your friendship for us and when you have been tempted by our enemies you have not joined yourselves to them I both commend you for this your fidelity and ex hort you to continue in the same disposition for which you  shall be repaid and receive rewards from us for I will free  Since Jonathan plainly did not put on the pontifical robes till seven or eight years after the death of his brother Judas or not till the feast of tabernacles in the I60th of the Seleucidae 1 Maccab x 21 Fetitus emendation seems here to de serve consideration who instead of after four years since the death of his brother Judas would have us read and therefore after eight years since the death of his bro ther Judas This would tolerably well agree with the death of the Maccabees and with Josephus own exact chronology at the end of the twentieth book of these An tiquities which the present text cannot be made to do VOL

and the half of the fruits of the trees I relinquish my part 01 them from this day And as to the poll money which ought to be given me for every head of the inhabitants of Judea and of the three toparchies that adjoin to Judea Samaria and Galilee and Perea that I relinquish to you for this time and for all time to come I will also that the city of Jerusalem be holy and inviolable and free from the tythe and from the taxes unto its utmost bounds  And I so far recede from my title to the citadel as to permit Jonathan your high priest to possess it that he may place such a garrison in it as he ap proves of for fidelity and good will to himself that they may keep it for us I also make free all those Jews who have been made captives and slaves in my kingdom I also give order that the

fortified town that would be convenient for the Jewish country to have very strong let it be so built at my expenses 4 This was what Demetrius promised and granted to the Jews by this letter But king Alexander raised a great army of mercenary soldiers and of those that deserted to him out of Syria and made an expedition against Demetrius And when it was come to a battle the left wing of Demetrius put those who opposed them to flight and pursued them a great way and slew many of them and spoiled their camp but the right wing where Demetrius happened to be was beaten and as for all the rest they ran away but Demetrius fought courageously and slew a great many of the enemy but as he was in the pur suit of the rest his horse carried him into a deep bog where it was hard to get out and there it happened that upon his horse s falling down he could not escape being killed for  when his enemies saw what had befallen him they returned back and en compassed Demetrius round and they all threw their darts at him but he being now on foot fought bravely but at length he received so many wounds that he was not able to bear up any longer but fell And this is the end that Demetrius came to when he had reigned  eleven years as we have elsewhere related CHAP III The friendship that was between Onias and Ptolemy Philometer and how Onias built a temple in Egypt like to that at Jerusa lem Â 1 DUT then the son of Onias the high priest who was of the same name with his father and who fled to king Ptolemy who was called Philometer lived now at Alexandria as we have said already When this Onias saw that Judea was op pressed by the Macedonians and their kings out of a desire to purchase to himself a memorial and eternal fame he resolved to send to king Ptolemy and queen Cleopatra to ask leave of  Since the rest of the historians now extant give this Demetrius 13 years and Josephus only 11 years Dean Frideaux does not amiss in ascribing to him the mean number 12 198 ANTIQUITIES OF THK JEWS Book XIII them that he might build a temple in Egypt like to that at Je rusalem and might ordain Levites and priests out of their own stock The chief reason why he was desirous so to do was that he relied upon the prophet Isaiah who lived above six hundred years before and foretold that there certainly was to be a temple built to Almighty God in Egypt by a man that was a Jew Onias was elevated with this prediction and wrote the following epistle to Ptolemy and Cleopatra Having done many and great things for you in the affairs of the war by the assistance of God and that in Celesyria and Phenicia I came at length with the Jews to Leontopolis and to other places of your nation where I found that the greatest part of your people had temples in an improper manner and that on this account they bare ill will one against another which happens to the Egyptians by reason of the multitude of their temples and the difference of opinions about divine worship Now I found a very fit place in a castle that hath its name from the country Diana this place is full of materials of several sorts and replenished with sacred animals I desire therefore that you will grant me leave to purge this holy place which be longs to no master and is fallen down and to build there a temple to Almighty God after the pattern of that in Jerusa lem and of the same dimensions that may be for the benefit of thyself and thy wife and children that those Jews which dwell in Egypt may have a place whither they may come and meet together in mutual harmony one with another and be subservient to thy advantages for the prophet Isaiah fore told that  there should be an altar in Egypt to the Lord God  It seems to me contrary to the opinion of Josephus and of the moderns both Jews and Christians that this prophecy of Isaiah xix 19 c In that day there shall be an altar to the Lord in the midst of the land of Egypt Sec directly foretold the building of this temple of Onias in Egypt and was a sufficient warrant to the Jews for building it and for worshipping the true God the God of Israel therein See Authent Rec vol II p 755 That God seems to have soon better accepted of the sacri6ces and prayers here offered him than those at Jerusalem see the note on ch x sect 7 And truly the marks of Jewish corruption or interpolation in this text in order to discourage their people from approving of the worship of God here are very strong and highly deserve our consideration and correction The foregoing verse in Isaiah runs thus in our common copies Tn that day shall Jive cities in the land of Efy it the Hebrew language shall be full of Jews whose sacred books were in Hebrew and swear to the Lord of hosts One for the first shall be called the city of destruction Isa xs 18 A strange name city of destruction 1 upon so joyful an occasion and a name never heard of in the land of Egypt or perhaps in any other nation The old reading was evidently the city of the sun or Heliopolis  and Onkelos in effect and Symmachus with the Arabic version entirely confess that to be the true reading The Septuagint also though they have the text dis guised in the common copies and call it Asedek the city of righteousness yet in Chap III ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 199 And many other such things did he prophesy relating to that place 2 And this was what Onias wrote to king Ptolemy Now any one may observe his piety and that of his sister and wife Cleopatra s by that epistle which they wrote in answer to it for they laid the blame and the transgression of the law upon the head of Onias And this was their reply King Ptolemy and queen Cleopatra to Onias send greeting We have read thy petition wherein thou desirest leave to be given thee to purge that temple which is fallen down at Leontopolis in the Nomus of Heliopolis and which is named from the country Buhastis on which account we cannot but wonder that it should be pleasing to God to have a temple erected in a place so unclean and so full of sacred animals But since thou sayest that Isaiah the prophet foretold this long ago we give thee leave to do it if it may be done according to vour law and so that we may not appear to have at all of fended God herein 3 So Onias took the place and built a temple and an altar to God like indeed to that in Jerusalem but smaller and poor er  I do not think it proper for me now to describe its dimen sions or its vessels which have been already described in my seventh book of the wars of the Jews However Onias found other Jews like to himself together with priests and Levites that there performed divine service But we have said enough about this temple 4 Now it came to pass that the Alexandrian Jews and those Samaritans who paid their worship to the temple that was built in the days of Alexander at mount Gerizzim did now make a sedition one against another and disputed about their temples before Ptolemy himself the Jews saying that according to the laws of Moses the temple was to be built at Jerusalem and the Samaritans saying that it was to be built at Gerizzim two or three other copies the Hebrew word itself for the sun Coheres or Thares is preserved And since Onias insists with the king and queen that Isaiah s prophecy contained many other predictions relating to this place besides the words by him recited it is highly probable that these were especially meant by him and that one main reason why he applied this prediction to himself and to his prefecture of He liopolis which Dean Prideaux well proves was in that part of Egypt and why he chose to build in that prefecture of Heliopolis though otherwise an improper place was this that the same authority that he had for building this temple in Egypt the very same he had for building it in his own prefecture of Heliopolis also which he desired to do and which he did accordingly Dean Frideaux has much ado to avoid seeing this corruption of the Hebrew but it being in support of his own opin ion about this temple be durst not see it and indeed he reasons here in the most ivcviU and injudicious manner possible See him at the year 149 iiOO ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XI11 They desired therefore the king to sit with his friends and hear the debates about these matters and punish those with death who were baffled Now Sabbeus and Theodosius managed the argument for the Samaritans and Andronicus the son of Mes salamus for the people of Jerusalem and they took an oath by God and the king to make their demonstrations according to the law and they desired of Ptolemy that whomsoever he should find that transgressed what they had sworn to he would put him to death Accordingly the king took several of his friends into the council and sat down in order to hear what the pleaders said Now the Jews that were at Alexandria were in great concern for those men whose lot it was to contend for the temple at Jerusalem for they took it very ill that any should take away the reputation of that temple which was so ancient and so celebrated all over the habitable earth Now when Sab beus and Theodosius had given leave to Andronicus to speak first he began to demonstrate out of the law and out of the successions of the high priests how they every one in succession from his father had received that dignity and ruled over the temple and how all the kings of Asia had honoured that temple with their donations and with the most splendid gifts dedicated thereto But as for that at Gerizzim he made no account of it nor regarded it as if it had never had ateing By this speech and other arguments Andronicus persuaded the king to  deter mine that the temple at Jerusalem was built according to the laws of Moses and to put Sabbeus and Theodosius to death And these were the events that befell the Jews at Alexandria in the days of Ptolemy Philometer  A very unfair disputation this while the Jewish disputant knowing that he could not properly prove out of the Pentateuch that the place which the Lord their Cod shall choose t place his name there so often referred to in the book of Deuter onomy was Jerusalem any more than Gerizzim that being not determined till the days of David Autiq B VII ch xiii Â 4 vol I proves only what the Samaritans did not deny that the temple at Jerusalem was much more ancient and much more celebrated and honoured than that at Gerizzim which was nothing to the present purpose The whole evidence by the very oaths of both parties being we see ob liged to be confined to the law of Moses or to the Pentateuch alone However worldly policy and interest and the multitude prevailing the court gave sentence as usual on the stronger side and poor Sabbeus and Theodosius the Samaritan dis putants were martyred and this so far as appears without any direct hearing at all which is like the usual practice of such political courts about matters of religion Our copies say hat the body of the Jews were in a great concern about those men in the plural who were to dispute for their temple at Jerusalem whereas it seems here they had but one disputant Andronicus by name perhaps more were prepar ed to speak on the Jews side but the first having answered to his name and msr come the Samaritans there was no necessity for any other defender of the Jerusa lem temple Chap IV ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 201 CHAP IV Hffti Alexander honoured Jonathan after an extraordinary man ner and how Demetrius the son of Demetrius overcame Alex ander and made a league of friendship with Jonathan Â 1 DEMETRIUS being thus slain in battle as we have above related Alexander took the kingdom of Syria and wrote to Ptolemy Philometer and desired his daughter in mar riage and said it was but just that he should be joined in af finity to one that had now received the principality of his fore fathers and had been promoted to it by God s providence and had conquered Demetrius and that was on other accounts not unworthy of being related to him Ptolemy received this pro posal of marriage gladly and wrote him an answer saluting him on account of his having received the principality of his forefathers and promising him that he would give him his daughter in marriage and assured him that he was coming to meet him at Ptolemais and desired that he would there meet him for that he would accompany her from Egypt so far and would there marry his child to him When Ptolemy had written thus he came suddenly to Ptolemais and brought his cousin Cleopatra along with him and as he found Alexander there before him as he desired him to come he gave him his child in marriage and for her portion gave her as much silver and gold as became such a king to give 2 When the wedding was over Alexander wrote to Jona than the high priest and desired him to come to Ptolemais So when he came to these kings and had made them mag nificent presents he was honoured by them both Alexan der compelled him also to put off his own garment and to take a purple garment and made him sit with him in his throne and commanded his captains that they should go with him into the middle of the city and proclaim that it was not permitted to any one to speak against him or to give him any disturbance And when the captains had thus done those that were prepared to accuse Jonathan and who bore him ill will when they saw the honour that was done him by procla mation and that by the king s order ran away and were afraid lest some mischief should befall them Nay king Alexander was so very kind to Jonathan that he set him down as the principal of his friends 3 But then upon the hundred and sixty fifth year Deme trius the sen of Demetrius came from Crete with a great number of mercenary soldiers which Lasthenes the Cretian 202 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XIII brought him and sailed to Cilicia This thing cast Alexander into great concern and disorder when he heard it so he made haste immediately out of Phenicia and came to Antioch that he might put matters in a safe posture there before Demetrius should come He also left  Apollonius Daus governor of Ce lesyria who coming to Jamnia with a great army sent to Jona than the high priest and told him That it was not right that he alone should live at rest and with authority and not be subject to the king and this thing had made him a reproach among all men that he had not yet made him subject to the king Do not thou therefore deceive thyself and sit still among the mountains and pretend to have forces with thee but if thou hast any dependance on thy strength come down into the plain and let our armies be compared together and the event of the battle will demonstrate which of us is the most courageous However take notice that the most va  liant men of every city are in my army and that these are the very men vrho have always beaten thy progenitors but let us have the battle in such a place of the country where we may fight with weapons and not with stones and where there may be no place whither those that are beaten may fly 4 With this Jonathan was irritated and choosing himself out ten thousand of his soldiers he went out of Jerusalem in haste with his brother Simon and came to Joppa and pitched his camp on the outside of the city because the people of Joppa had shut their gates against him for they had a garrison in the city put there by Apollonius but when Jonathan was pre paring to besiege them they were afraid he would take them by force and so they opened the gates to him But Apollonius when he heard that Joppa was taken by Jonathan took three thousand horsemen and eight thousand footmen and came to Ashdod and removing thence he made his journey silently and slowly and going up to Joppa he made as if he was retiring from the place and so drew Jonathan into the plain as valuing himself highly upon his horsemen and having his hopes of vic tory principally in them However Jonathan sallied out and pursued Apollonius to Ashdod but as soon as Apollonius per ceived that his enemy was in the plain he came back and gave him battle but Apollonius had laid a thousand horsemen in am bush in a valley that they might not be seen by their enemies as  Of tlic several Ajiollonu about these ages see Dean Prideaux at tlic year 148 This Apollonius Daus was by his account the son of that Apollonius who had been made governor of Celesyria and Phenicia by Scleucus Philopator and was himself a confident of his son Demetrius the father and restored to his father s government by him but afterwards revolted from him to Alexander but not to Demetrius the son as he supposes Chap IV ANTIQUITIES OF THt JEWS 203 behind them which when Jonathan perceived he was under no consternation but ordering his army to stand in a square bat tle array he gave them a charge to fall on the enemy on both sides and set them to face those that attacked them both before and behind And while the fight lasted till the evening he gave part of his forces to his brother Simon and ordered him to attack the enemies but for himself he charged those that were with them to cover themselves with their armour and receive the darts of the horsemen who did as they were commanded so that the enemies horsemen while they threw their darts till they had no more left did them no harm for the darts that were thrown did not enter into their bodies being thrown upon the shields that were united and conjoined together the closeness of which easily overcame the forces of the darts and they flew about without any effect But when the enemy grew remiss in throwing their darts from morning till late at night Simon perceived their weariness and fell upon the body of men before him and because his soldiers showed great alacrity he put the enemy to flight and when the horsemen saw that the footmen ran away neither did they stay themselves but they being very weary by the duration of the fight till the evening and their hope from the footmen being quite gone they basely ran away and in great confusion also till they were separated one from another and scattered over all the plain Upon which Jonathan pursued them as far as Ashdod and slew a great many of them and compelled the rest in despair of escaping to fly to the tem ple of Dagon which was at Ashdod but Jonathan took the city on the first onset and burnt it and the villages about it nor did he abstain from the temple of Dagon itself and burnt it al so and destroyed those that had fled to it Now the entire mul titude of the enemies that fell in the battle and were consumed in the temple were eight thousand When Jonathan therefore had overcome so great an army he removed from Ashdod and came to Askelon and when he had pitched his camp without the city the people of Askelon came out and met him bringing him hospitable presents and honouring him so he accepted of their kind intentions and returning thence to Jerusalem with a great deal of prey which he brought thence when he conquered his enemies but when Alexander heard that Apollonius the general of his army was beaten he pretended to be glad of it because he had fought with Jonathan his friend and ally against his directions Accordingly he sent to Jonathan and gave testimony to his worth and gave him honorary  rewards as a  Dr Hudson here observes that the Phenicians and Romans used to reward such as had deserved well of them by presenting to them a golden button See chap v sect 4 VOL II C C 21 204 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XIII golden button which it is the custom to give the king s kins men and allowed him Ekron and its toparchy for his own inheritance 5 About this time it was that king Ptolemy who was call ed Philometer led an army part by the sea and part by land and came to Syria to the assistance of Alexander who was his son in law and accordingly all the cities received him willingly as Alexander had commanded them to do and conducted him as far as Ashdod where they all made loud complaints about the temple of Dagon which was burnt and accused Jona than of having laid it waste and destroyed the country adjoin ing with fire and slain a great number of them Ptolemy heard these accusations but said nothing Jonathan also went to meet Ptolemy as far as Joppa and obtained from him hospitable pre sents and those glorious in their kinds with all the marks of honour And when he had conducted him as far as the river called Eleutherus he returned again to Jerusalem 6 But as Ptolemy was at Ptolemais he was very near to a most unexpected destruction for a treacherous design was laid for his life by Alexander by the means of Ammonius who was his friend and as the treachery was very plain Ptolemy wrote to Alexander and required of him that he should bring Ammo nius to condign punishment informing him what snares had been laid for him by Ammonius and desiring thathe might be accord ingly punished for it But when Alexander did not comply with his demands he perceived that it was he himself who laid the design and was very angry at him Alexander had also formerly been in very ill terms with the people of Antioch for they had suffered very much by his means yet did Ammonius at length undergo the punishment his insolent crimes had deserv ed for he was killed in an opprobrious manner like a woman while he endeavoured to conceal himself in a feminine habit as we have elsewhere related 7 Hereupon Ptolemy blamed himself for having given his daughter in marriage to Alexander and for the league he had made with him to assist him against Demetrius so he dissolved his relation to him and took his daughter away from him and immediately sent to Demetrius and offered to make a league of mutual assistance and friendship with him and agreed with him to give him his daughter in marriage and to restore him to the principality of his fathers Demetrius was well pleased with this embassage and accepted of his assistance and of the marriage of his daughter But Ptolemy had still one more hard task to do and that was to persuade the people of Antioch to receive Dervetrihsj because they were greatly displeased at him on Chap IV ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 205 account of the injuries his father Demetrius had done them yet did he bring this about for as the people of Antioch hated Alexander on Ammonius account as we have showed already they were easily prevailed with to cast him out of Antioch who thus expelled out of Antioch came into Cilicia Ptolemy came then to Antioch and was made king by its inhabitants and by the army so that he was forced to put on two diadems the one of Asia the other of Egypt but being naturally a good and a righteous man and not desirous of what belonged to others and besides these dispositions being also a wise man in reasoning about futurities he determined to avoid the envy of the Romans so he called the people of Antioch together to an assembly and persuaded them to receive Demetrius and assured them that he would not be mindful of what they did to his father in case he should now be obliged by them and he undertook that he would himself be a good monitor and governor to him and promised that he would not permit him to attempt any bad actions but that for his own part he was contented with the kingdom of Egypt By which discourse he persuaded the people of Antioch to receive Demetrius 8 But now Alexander made haste with a numerous and great army and came out of Cilicia into Syria and burnt the country belonging to Antioch and pillaged it whereupon Ptolemy and his son in law Demetrius brought their army against him for he had already given him his daughter in marriage and beat Alexander and put him to flight and accordingly he fled into Arabia Now it happened in the time of battle that Ptolemy s horse upon hearing the noise of an elephant cast him ofi his back and threw him on the ground upon the sight of which accident his enemies fell upon him and gave him many wounds upon his head and brought him into danger of death for when his guards caught him up he was so very ill that for four days time he was not able either to understand or to speak How ever Zabdiel a prince among the Arabians cut off Alexander s head and sent it to Ptolemy who recovering of his wounds and returning to his understanding on the fifth day heard at once a most agreeable hearing and saw a most agreeable sight which were the death and the head of Alexander yet a little after this his joy for the death of Alexander with which he was so greatly satisfied he also departed this life Now Alexander who was called Balas reigned over Asia five years as we have elsewhere related 9 But when Demetrius who was styled  Nicator had taken the kingdom he was so wicked as to treat Ptolemy s sol  This name Demetrius Nicator or Demetrius the amfueror is so written on 206 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XIII diers very hardly neither remembering the league of mutual as sistance that was between them nor that he was his son in law and kinsman by Cleopatra s marriage to him so the soldiers fled from his wicked treatment to Alexandria but Demetrius kept his elephants But Jonathan the high priest levied an army out of all Judea and attacked the citadel at Jerusalem and besieged it it was held by a garrison of Macedonians and by some of those wicked men who had deserted the customs of their forefathers These men at first despised the attempts of Jonathan for taking the place as depending on its strength but some of those wicked men went out by night and came to De metrius and informed him that the citadel was besieged who was irritated with what he heard and took his army and came from Antioch against Jonathan And when he was at An tioch he wrote to him and commanded him to come to him quickly to Ptolemais upon which Jonathan did not in termit the siege of the citadel but took with him the elders of the people and the priests and carried with him gold and silver and garments and a great number of presents of friendship and came to Demetrius and presented him with them and thereby pacified the king s anger So he was honoured by him and re ceived from him the confirmation of his high priesthood as he had possessed it by the grants of the kings his predecessors And when the Jewish deserters accused him Demetrius was so far from giving credit to them that when he petitioned him that he would demand no more than three hundred talents for the tribute of all Judea and the three toparchies of Samaria and Perea and Galilee he complied with the proposal and gave him a letter confirming all those grants whose contents were as follows King Demetrius to Jonathan his brother and to the nation of the Jews sendeth greeting We have sent you a copy of that epistle which we have written to Lasthenes our kinsman that you may know its contents King Demetrius to Lasthenes our lather sendeth greeting I have determined to return thanks and to show favour to the nation of the Jews which hath ob served the rules ofjusticeinourconcerns Accordingly I remit to them the three prefectures Apherimo and Lydda and Ra matha which have been added to Judea out of Samaria with their appurtenances As also what the kings my predecessors received from those that offered sacrifices in Jerusalem and what are due from the fruits of the earth and of the trees and what else belongs to us with the salt pits and the crowns that used to be presented to us Nor shall they be compelled his coins still extant as Hudson and Spanheim inform us the latter of whom gives us here the entire inscription Xing Demetrius the God Philatklphus Nicator Chap V ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 207 to pay any of these taxes from this time to all futurity Take care therefore that a copy of this epistle be taken and given to Jonathan and be set up in an eminent place of their holy temple And these were the contents of this writing And now when Demetrius saw that there was peace every where and that there was no danger nor fear of war he dis banded the greatest part of his army and diminished their pay and even retained in pay no others but such foreigners as came up with him from Crete and from the other islands How ever this procured him ill will and hatred from the soldiers on whom he bestowed nothing from this time while the kings before him used to pay them in time of peace as they did be fore that they might have their good will and that they might be very ready to undergo the difficulties of war if any occasion should require it CHAP V How Trypho after he had beaten Demetrius delivered the king dom to Antiochus the son of Alexander and gained Jonathan for his assistant And concerning the actions and embassies of Jonathan Â 1 JN ow there was a certain commander of Alexander s forces an Apenemian by birth whose name was Diodotus and was also called Trypho took notice of the ill will the soldiers bare to Demetrius and went to Malchus the Arabian who brought up Antiochus the son of Alexander and told him what ill will the army bare Demetrius and persuaded him to give him Antiochus because he would make him king and recover to him the kingdom of his father Malchus at the first opposed him in this attempt because he could not believe him but when Trypho lay hard at him for a long time he over persuaded him to comply with Trypho s intentions and entreaties And this was the state Trypho was now in 2 But Jonathan the high priest being desirous to get clear of those that were in the citadel at Jerusalem and of the Jew ish deserters and wicked men as well as of those in all the gar risons in the country sent presents and ambassadors to Deme trius and entreated him to take away his soldiers out of the strong holds of Judea Demetrius made answer That after the war which he was now deeply engaged in was over he would not only grant him that but greater things than that also and he desired he would send him some assistance and informed him that his army had deserted him So Jonathan chose out three thousand of his soldiers and sent them to Demetrius 208 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XIII 3 Now the people of Antioch hated Demetrius both on ac count of what mischief he had himself done them and because they were his enemies also on account of his father Demetrius who had greatly abused them so they watched some opportu nity which they might lay hold on to fall upon him And when they were informed of the assistance that was coming to Demetrius from Jonathan and considered at the same time that he would raise a numerous army unless they prevented him and seized upon him they took their weapons immediately and encompassed his palace in the way of a siege and seizing upon all the ways of getting out they sought to subdue their king And when he saw that the people of Antioch were become his bitter enemies and that they were thus in arms he took the mercenary soldiers which he had with him and those Jews who were sent by Jonathan and assaulted the Antiochians but he was overpowered by them for they were many ten thou sands and was beaten But when the Jews saw that the An tiochians were superior they went up to the top of the palace and shot at them from thence and because they were so re mote from them by their height that they suffered nothing on their side but did great execution on the others as fighting from such an elevation they drove them out of the adjoining houses and immediately set them on fire whereupon the flames spread itself over the whole city and burnt it all down This hap pened by reason of the closeness of the houses and because they were generally built of wood so the Antiochians when they were not able to help themselves nor to stop the fire were put to flight And as the Jews leaped from the top of one house to the top of another and pursued them after that manner it thence happened that the pursuit was so very surprising But when the king saw that the Antiochians were very busy in saving their children and their wives and so did not fight any longer he fell upon them in the narrow passages and fought them and slew a great many of them till at last they were forced to throw down their arms and to deliver themselves up to Demetrius So he forgave them this their jnsolent beha viour and put an end to the sedition and when he had given rewards to the Jews out of the rich spoils he had gotten and had returned them thanks as the cause of his victory he sent them away to Jerusalem to Jonathan with an ample testimony of the assistance they had afforded him Yet did he prove an ill man to Jonathan afterward and broke the promises he had made and he threatened that he would make war upon him unless he would pay all that tribute which the Jewish nation owed to the first kings of Syria And this he had done if Trypho had not hindered him and diverted his preparations Chap V ANTIQUITIES OK THE JEWS i 09 against Jonathan to a concern for his own preservation  for he now returned out of Arabia into Syria with the child Antio chus for he was in age but a youth and put the diadem on his head And as the whole forces that had left Demetrius be cause they had no pay came to his assistance he made war upon Demetrius and joining battle with him overcame him in the fight and took from him both his elephants and the city Antioch 4 Demetrius upon this defeat retired into Cilicia but the child Antiochus sent ambassadors and an epistle to Jonathan and made him his friend and confederate and confirmed to him the high priesthood and yielded up to him the four prefectures which had been added to Judea Moreover he sent him vessels and cups of gold and a purple garment and gave him leave to use them He also presented him with a golden button and styled him one of his principal friends and appointed his bro ther Simon to be the general over the forces from the ladder of Tyre unto Egypt So Jonathan was so well pleased with these grants made him by Antiochus that he sent ambassadors to him and to Trypho and professed himself to be their friend and confederate and said he would join with him in a war against Demetrius informing him that he had made no proper returns for the kindnesses he had done him for that when he had received many marks of kindness from him when he stood in great need of them he for such good turns had requited him with further injuries 5 So Antiochus gave Jonathan leave to raise himself a nu merous army out of Syria and Phenicia and to make war against Demetrius generals whereupon he went in haste to the seve ral cities which received him splendidly indeed but put no forces into his hands And when he was come from thence to Askelon the inhabitants of Askelon came and brought him pre sents and met him in a splendid manner He exhorted them and every one of the cities of Celesyria to forsake Demetrius and to join with Antiochus and in assisting him to endeavour to punish Demetrius for what offences he had been guilty of against themselves and told them there were many reasons for that their procedure if they had a mind so to do And when he had persuaded those cities to promise their assistance to Antio chus he came to Gaza in order to induce them also to be friends to Antiochus but he found the inhabitants of Gaza much more alienated from him than he expected for they had shut their gates against him and although they had deserted Demetrius they had not resolved to join themselves to Antiochus This provoked Jonathan to besiege them and to harass their country for as he set a part of his army round about Gaza itself so with the rest he overran their land and spoiled it and burnt what 210 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XIII was in it When the inhabitants of Gaza saw themselves in this state of affliction and that no assistance came to them from De metrius that what distressed them was at hand but what should profit them was still at a great distance and it was uncertain whether it would come at all or not they thought it would be prudent conduct to leave off any longer continuance with him and to cultivate friendship with the other so they sent to Jona than and professed they would be his friends and afford him assistance for such is the temper of men that before they have had the trial of great afflictions they do not understand what is for their advantage but when they find themselves under such afflictions they then change their minds and what it had been better for them to have done before they had been at all dam aged they choose to do but not till after they have suffered such damages However he made a league of friendship with them and took from them hostages for their performance of it and sent these hostages to Jerusalem while he went himself over all the country as far as Damascus 6 But when he heard that the generals of Demetrius forces were come to the city Kadesh with a numerous army the place lies between the land of the Tyrians and Galilee for they supposed they should hereby draw him out of Syria in order to preserve Galilee and that he would not overlook the Gali leans who were his own people when war was made upon them he went to meet them having left Simon in Judea who raised as great an army as he was able out of the country and then sat down before Bethsura and besieged it that being the strong est place in all Judea and a garrison of Demetrius kept it as we have already related But as Simon was raising banks and bringing his engines of war against Bethsura and was very earnest about the siege of it the garrison was afraid lest the place should be taken of Simon by force and they put to the sword so they sent to Simon and desired the security of his oath that they should come to no harm from him and that they would leave the place and go away to Demetrius Ac cordingly he gave them his oath and ejected them out of the city and he put therein a garrison of his own 7 But Jonathan removed out of Galilee and from the wa ters which are called Gennesar for there he was before en camped and came into the plain that is called Asor without knowing that the enemy was there When therefore Deme trius men knew a day beforehand that Jonathan was coming against them they laid an ambush in the mountain who were to assault him on the sudden while they themselves met him with an army in the plain which army when Jonathan saw ready to engage him he also got ready his own soldiers for the Chap V ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 211 battle as well as he was able but those that were laid in am bush by Demetrius generals being behind them the Jews were afraid lest they should be caught in the midst between two bo dies and perish so they ran away in haste and indeed all the rest left Jonathan but a few there were in number about fifty who staid with him and with them Mattathias the son of Ab salom and Judas the son of Chapseus who were commanders of the whole army These marched boldly and like men des perate against the enemy and so pushed them that by their courage they daunted them and with their weapons in their hands they put them to flight And when those soldiers of Jo nathan that had retired saw the enemy giving way they got together after their flight and pursued them with great vio lence and this did they as far as Kadesh where the camp of the enemy lay 8 Jonathan having thus gotten a glorious victory and slain two thousand of the enemy returned to Jerusalem So when he saw that all his affairs prospered according to his mind by the providence of God he sent ambassadors to the Romans being desirous of renewing that friendship which their nation had with them formerly He enjoined the same ambassadors that as they came back they should go to the Spartans and put them in mind of their friendship and kindred So when the ambas sadors came to Rome they went into their senate and said what they were commanded by Jonathan the high priest to say how he had sent them to confirm their friendship The senate then confirmed what had been formerly decreed concerning their friendship with the Jews and gave them letters to carry to all the kings of Asia and Europe and to the governors of the cities that they might safely conduct them to their own country Accordingly as they returned they came to Sparta and deliver ed the epistle which they had received of Jonathan to them a copy of which here follows  Jonathan the high priest of the Jewish nation and the senate and body of the people of the Jews to the cphori and senate and people of the Lacedemo nians send greeting If you be well and both your public and private affairs be agreeable to your mind it is accordisg to our wishes We are well also When in former times an epistle was brought to Onias who was then our high priest from Areus who at that time was your king by Demoteles concerning the kindred that was between us and you a copy of which is here subjoined we both joyfully received the epistle and were well pleased with Demoteles and Areus al though we did not need such a demonstration because  we  This clause is otherwise rendered in the 6rst book of Maccabees xii 9 tor that we have the holy books of scripture in our hands to comfort us The Hebrew VOL II D D 21 212 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XIII were satisfied about it from the sacred writings yet did not we think fit first to begin the claim of this relation to you lest we should seem too early in taking to ourselves the glory which is now given us by you It is a long time since this relation of ours to you hath been renewed and when we upon holy and festival days offer sacrifices to God we pray to him for your preservation and victory As to ourselves although we have had many wars that have compassed us around by reason of the covetousness of our neighbours yet did we not determine to be troublesome either to you or to others that were related to us but since we have now over come our enemies and have occasion to send Numenius the son of Antiochus and Antipater the son of Jason who are both honourable men belonging to our senate to the Romans we gave them this epistle to you also that they might renew that friendship which is between us You will therefore do well yourselves to write to us and send us an account of what you stand in need of from us since we are in all things dis posed to act according to your desires So the Lacedemo nians received the ambassadors kindly and made a decree for friendship and mutual assistance and sent it to them 9 At this time there were three sects among the Jews who had different opinions concerning human actions the one was called the sect of the Pharisees another the sect of the Sadducees and the other the sect of the Essens Now for the  Pharisees original being lost we cannot certainly judge which was the truest version only the coherence favours Josephus But if this were the Jews1 meaning that they were satisfied out of their Bible that the Jews and Lacedemonians were of kin that part of their Bible is now lost for we find no such assertion in our present copies  Those that suppose Josephus to contradict himself in his three several accounts of the notions of the Pharisees this here and that earlier one which is the largest of the War B II chap viii sect 14 vol III and the latter Antiq B XVIII chap i sect 3 vol III as if he sometimes said they introduced an absolute fatality and denied all freedom of human actions is almost wholly groundless he ever as the very learned Casaubon here truly observes asserting ihat the Pharisees were be tween the Essens and Sadducees and did so far ascribe all to fate or divine provi dence as was consistent with the freedom of human actions However their per plexed way of talking about fate or providence as overruling all things made it commonly thought they were willing to excuse their sins by ascribing them to fate as in the Apostolical Constitutions B VI chap vi Perhaps under the same gen eral name some difference of opinions in this point might be propagated as is very common in all parties especially in points of metaphysical subtilty However our Josephus who in his bean was a great admirer of the piety of the Essens was yet in practice a Pharisee as he himself informs us in his own life sect 2 vol 111 And bis account of this doctrine of the Pharisees is for certain agreeable to his own opinion who ever both fully allowed the freedom of human actions and yet strongly believed the powerful interposition of divine providence See concerning this mat ter a remarkable clause Antiq B XVI chap xi sect 7 Chap V ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 218 they say that some actions but not all are the work of fate and some of them are in our own power and that they are liable to fate but are not caused by fate But the sect of the Essens affirm that fate governs all things and that nothing befalls men but what is according to its determination And for the Saddu cees they take away fate and say there is no such thing and that the events of human affairs are not at its disposal but they suppose that all our actions are in our own power so that we are ourselves the causes of what is good and receive what is evil from our own folly However I have given a more exact ac count of these opinions in the second book of the Jewish war 10 But now the generals of Demetrius being willing to re cover the defeat they had had gathered a greater army together than they had before and came against Jonathan but as soon as he was informed of their coming he went suddenly to meet them to the country of Hamoth for he resolved to give them no opportunity of coming into Judea so he pitched his camp at fifty furlongs distant from the enemy and sent out spies to take a view of their camp and after what manner they were encamp ed When his spies had given him full information and had seized upon some of them by night who told him the enemy would soon attack him he thus apprized beforehand provided for his security and placed watchmen beyond his camp and kept all his forces armed all night and he gave them a charge to be of good courage and to have their minds prepared to fight in the night time if they should be obliged to do so lest their enemies designs should seem concealed from them But when Demetrius commanders were informed that Jonathan knew what they mtended their counsels were disordered and it alarm ed them to find that the enemy had discovered those their in tentions nor did they expect to overcome them any other way now they had failed in the snares they had laid for them for should they hazard an open battle they did not think they should be a match for Jonathan s army so they resolved to fly and having lighted many fires that when the enemy saw them they might suppose they were there still they retired But when Jonathan came to give them battle in the morning in their camp and found it deserted and understood they were fled he pursued them yet he could not overtake them for they had already passed over the river Eleutherus and were out of danger So when Jonathan was returned thence he went into Arabia and fought against the Nabateans and drove away a great deal of their prey and took many captives and came to Damascus and there sold of that he had taken About the same time it was that Simon his brother went over all Judea and Palestine as far as Askelon and fortified the strong holds and when he 214 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XIII had made them very strong both in the edifices erected and in the garrisons placed in them he came to Joppa and when he had taken it he brought a great garrison into it for he heard that the people of Joppa were disposed to deliver up the city to Demetrius generals 11 When Simon and Jonathan had finished these affairs they returned to Jerusalem where Jonathan gathered all the people together and took counsel to restore the walls of Jerusalem and to rebuild the wall that encompassed the temple which had been thrown down and to make the places adjoining stronger by very high towers and besides that to build another wall in the midst of the city in order to exclude the market place from the gar rison which was in the citadel and by that means to hinder them from any plenty of provisions and moreover to make the for tresses that were in the country much stronger and more defen sible than they were before And when these things were ap proved of by the multitude as rightly proposed Jonathan him self took care of the building that belonged to the city and sent Simon away to make the fortresses in the country more secure than formerly But Demetrius passed over Euphrates and came into Mesopotamia as desirous to retain that country still as well as Babylon and when he should have obtained the do minion of his upper provinces to lay a foundation for recover ing his entire kingdom for those Greeks and Macedonians who dwelt there frequently sent ambassadors to him and promised that if he would come to them they would deliver themselves up to him and assist him in fighting against  Arsaces the king of the Parthians So he was elevated with these hopes and came hastily to them as having resolved that if he had once overthrown the Parthians and gotten an army of his own he would make war against Trypho and eject him out of Syria and the people of that country received him with great alacrity So he raised forces with which he fought against Arsaces and lost all his army and was himself taken alive as we have else where related  This king who was of the famous race of Arsaces is both here and 1 Mac Jtiv 2 called by the family name Arsaces but Appion says his proper name was Phrates He is here also called by Joscplius the king of the Far hums as the Greeks used to call them but by the elder author of the first Maccabees the king af the Persians and Males according to the language of the eastern nations See ftuthent Rec part II p 1108 Chap VI ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 215 CHAP VI HffiD Jonathan was slain by treachery and how thereupon the Jews made Simon their general and high priest what coura geous actions also he performed especially against Trypho 6 1 Now when Trypho knew what had befallen Deme trius he was no longer firm to Antiochus but contrived by subtilty to kill him and then take possession of his kingdom but the fear that he was in of Jonathan was an obstacle to this his design for Jonathan was a friend to Antiochus for which cause he resolved first to take Jonathan out of the way and then to set about his design relating to Antiochus but he judging it best to take him off by deceit and treachery came from Antioch to Bethshan which by the Greeks is called Scythopolis at which place Jonathan met him with forty thousand chosen men for he thought that he came to fight him but when he perceived that Jonathan was ready to fight he attempted to gain him by pre sents and kind treatment and gave order to his captains to obey him and by these means was desirous to give assurance of his good will and to take away all suspicions out of his mind that so he might make him careless and inconsiderate and might take him when he was unguarded He also advised him to dismiss his army because there was no occasion for bringing it with him when there was no war but all was in peace However he desired him to retain a few about him and go with him to Ptolemais for that he would deliver the city up to him and would bring all the fortresses that were in the country under his dominion and he told him that he came with those very designs 2 Yet did not Jonathan suspect any thing at all by this his management but believed that Trypho gave him this advice out of kindness and with a sincere design Accordingly he dismissed his army and retained no more than three thousand of them with him and left two thousand in Galilee and he himself with one thousand came with Trypho to Ptolemais But when the people of Ptolemais had shut their gates as it had been com manded by Trypho to do he took Jonathan alive and slew all that were with him He also sent soldiers against those two thousand that were left in Galilee in order to destroy them but those men having heard the report of what had happened to Jo nathan they prevented the execution and before those that were sent by Trypho came they covered themselves with their ar mour and went away out of the country Now when those that were sent against them saw that they were ready to fight for their lives they gave them no disturbance but returned back to Trypho 216 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JKWS Book XIII 3 But when the people of Jerusalem heard that Jonathan was taken and that the soldiers who were with him were destroyed they deplored his sad fate and there was earnest inquiry made about him by every body and a great and just fear fell upon them and made them sad lest now they were deprived of the courage and conduct of Jonathan the nations about them should bear them ill will and as they were before quiet on account ot Jonathan they should now rise up against them and by making war with them should force them into the utmost dangers And indeed what they suspected really befell them for when those na tions heard of the death of Jonathan they began to make war with the Jews as now destitute of a governor and Trypho him self got an army together and had an intention to go up to Judea and make war against its inhabitants But when Simon saw that the people of Jerusalem were terrified at the circumstances they were in he desired to make a speech to them and thereby to render them more resolute in opposing Trypho when he should come against them He then called the people together into the temple and thence began thus to encourage them O my coun trymen you are not ignorant that our father myself and my brethren have ventured to hazard our lives and that willingly for the recovery of your liberty since I have therefore such plenty of examples before me and we of our family have de termined with ourselves to die for our laws and our divine worship there shall no terror be so great as to banish this re solution from our souls nor to introduce in its place a love of life and a contempt of glory Do you therefore follow me with alacrity whithersoever I shall lead you as not destitute of such a captain as is willing to suffer and to do the great est things for you for neither am I better than my brethren that I should be sparing of my own life nor so far worse than they as to avoid and refuse what they thought the most honour able of all things I mean to undergo death for your laws and for that worship of God which is peculiar to you I will there fore give such proper demonstrations as will show that I am their own brother and I am so bold as to expect that I shall avenge their blood upon our enemies and deliver you all with your wives and children from the injuries they intend against you and with God s assistance to preserve your temple from destruction by them for I see that these nations have you in contempt as being without a governor and that they thence are encouraged to make war against you 4 By this speech of Simon s he inspired the multitude with courage and as they had been before dispirited through fear they were now raised to a good hope of better things insomuch that the whole multitude of the people cried out all at once that Simon Chap VI ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 217 should be their leader and that instead of Judas and Jonathan his brethren he should have the government over them and they promised that they would readily obey him in whatsoever he should command them So he got together immediately all his own soldiers that were fit for war and made haste in rebuilding the walls of the city and strengthening them by very high and strong towers and sent a friend of his one Jonathan the son of Absalom to Joppa and gave him orders to eject the inhabitants out of the city for he was afraid lest they should deliver up the city to Trypho but he himself stayed to secure Jerusalem 5 But Trypho removed from Ptolemais with a great army and came into Judea and brought Jonathan with him in bonds Simon also met him with his army at the city Adida which is upon a hill and beneath it lie the plains of Judea And when Trypho knew that Simon was by the Jews made their governor he sent to him and would have imposed upon him by deceit and treachery and desired him if he would have his brother Jonathan released that he would send him a hundred talents of silver and two of Jonathan s sons as hostages that when he shall be released he may not make Judea revolt from the king for that at pre sent he was kept in bonds on account of the money he had bor rowed of the king and now owed it to him But Simon was aware of the craft of Trypho and although he knew that if he gave him the money he should lose it and that Trypho would not set his brother free and withal should deliver the sons of Jonathan to the enemy yet because he was afraid that he should have a calumny raised against him among the multitude as the cause of his brother s death if he neither gave the money nor sent Jonathan s sons he gathered his army together and told them what offers Trypho had made and added this that the offers were ensnaring and treacherous and yet that it was more eligible to send the money and Jonathan s sons than to be liable to the imputation of not complying with Trypho s offers and thereby refusing to save his brother Accordingly Simon sent the sons of Jonathan and the money but when Trypho had re ceived them he did not keep his promise nor set Jonathan free but took his army and went about all the country and resolved to go afterward to Jerusalem by the way of Idumea while Si mon went over against him with his army and all along pitch ed his own camp over against his 6 But when those that were in the citadel had sent to Try pho and besought him to make haste and come to them and to send them provisions he prepared his cavalry as though he would be at Jerusalem that very night but so great a quantity of snow fell in the night that it covered the roads and made them so deep that there was no passing especially for the cavalry This 218 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS BlX k XIII hindered him from coming to Jerusalem whereupon Trypho removed thence and came into Celesyria and falling vehement ly upon the land of Gilead he slew Jonathan there and when he had given order for his burial he returned himself to Anti och However Simon sent some to the city Basea to bring away his brother s bones and buried them in their own city Modin and all the people made great lamentation over him Simon also erected a very large monument for his father and his brethren of white and polished stone and raised it a great height and so as to be seen a long way off and made cloisters about it and set up pillars which were of one stone a piece a work it was wonderful to see Moreover he built seven pyramids also for his parents and his brethren one for each of them which were made very surprising both for their largeness and beauty and which have been preserved to this day and we know that it was Simon who bestowed so much zeal about the burial of Jonathan and the building of these monuments for his relations Now Jonathan died when he had been high priest  four years and had been also the governor of his nation And these were the circumstances that concerned his death 7 But Simon who was made high priest by the multitude on the very first year of his high priesthood set his people free from their slavery under the Macedonians and permitted them to pay tribute to them no longer which liberty and freedom from tribute they obtained after a f hundred and seventy years of the kingdom of the Assyrians which was after Seleucus who  There is some error in the copies here when no more than four years are as cribed to the high priesthood of Jonathan We know by Josephus last Jewish chronology Antiq B XX chap x vol III that there was an interval of seven years between the death of Alcimus or Jacimus the last high priest and the real priesthood of Jonathan to whom yet those seven years seem here to be ascribed as a p irt of them were to Judas before Antiq B XII chap 3t sect 6 vol II Now since besides these seven years interregnum in the pontificate we are told Antiq B XX chap z that Jonathan s real high priesthood lasted seven years more these two seven years will make up fourteen years which I suppose was Josephus own number in this place instead of the four in our present copies  These 17O years of the Assyrians mean no more as Josephus explains himself here than from the sera of Seleucus which as it is known to have began on the 312th year before the Christian a ra from its spring in the first book of Maccabees and from its autumn in the second book of Maccabees so did it not begin at Baby lon till the next spring on the 311th year See Prid at the year 312 And it is truly observed by Dr Hudson on this place that the Syrians and Assyrians are sometimes confounded in ancient authors according to the words of Justin the epitomizer of Trogus Pompeius who says That the Assyrians were afterwards called Syrians B I ch xi See Of the War B V ch ix sect 4 vol IV where the Philistines themselves at the very south limit of Syria in its utmost extent an called Assyrians by Josephus as Spanheim observes Chap VII ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 219 was called Nicator got the dominion over Syria Now the af fection of the multitude towards Simon was so great that in their contracts one with another and in the public records they wrote In the first year of Simon the benefactor and ethnarch of the Jews for under him they were very happy and over came the enemies that were round about them for Simon over threw the city Gazara and Joppa and Jamnia Pie also took the citadel of Jerusalem by siege and cast it down to the ground that it might not be any more a place of refuge to their enemies when they took it to do them a mischief as it had been till now And when he had done this he thought it their best way and most for their advantage to level the very mountain itself upon which the citadel happened to stand that so the temple might be higher than it And indeed when he had called the mul titude to an assembly he persuaded them to have it so demolish ed and this by putting them in mind what miseries they had suffered by its garrison and the Jewish deserters and what miseries they might hereafter suffer in case any foreigner should obtain the kingdom and put a garrison into that citadel This speech induced the multitude to a compliance because he ex horted them to do nothing but what was for their own good so they all set themselves to the work and levelled the moun tain and in that work spent both day and night without any intermission which cost him three whole years before it was re moved and brought to an entire level with the plain of the rest of the city After which the temple was the highest of all the buildings now the citadel as well as the mountain whereon it stood were demolished And these actions were thus perform ed under Simon CHAP VII HoiÂ

followed and faithfully abridged as far as the 50th verse of the twelfth chapter seems there to have ended What few things there are afterward common to both might probably be learned by him from some other more imperfect records However we must exactly observe here what the re maining part of that book of the Maccabeus informs us of and what Josephus would never have omitted had his copy contained so much that this Simon the Great the Maccabee made a league with Amiochus Soter the son of Demetrius Soter and bro ther of the other Demetrius who was now a captive in Parthia that upon his corr i

years though he gave it out that he died under the hands of the surgeons He then sent his friends and those that were most intimate with him to the soldiers and promised that he would give them a great deal of money if they would make him king He intimated to them that Demetrius was made a captive by the Parthians and that De metrius brother Antiochus if he came to be king would do them a great deal of mischief in way of revenge for their re volting from his brother So the soldiers in expectation of the wealth they should get by bestowing the kingdom on Trypho made him their ruler However when Trypho had gained the management of affairs he demonstrated his disposition to be wicked for while he was a private person he cultivated a fa miliarity with the multitude and pretended to great modera tion and so drew them on artfully to whatsoever he pleased but when he had once taken the kingdom he laid aside any farther dissimulation and was true Trypho which behaviour made his enemies superior to him for the soldiery hated him and revolted from him to Cleopatra the wife of Demetrius who was then shut up in Seleucia with her children But as Antiochus the brother of Demetrius who was called Soter to the crown about the 140th year before the Christian sera he granted great pri vileges to the Jewish nation and to Simon their high priest and ethnarch which privileges Simon seems to have taken of his own accord about three years before In particular he gave him leave to coin money for his country with his own stamp and as concerning Jerusalem and the sanctuary that they should be free or as the vulgar Latin hath it holy and free 1 Maccab xv 6 7 which I take to be the true reading as being the very words of his father s concession offered to Jonathan several years before ch x 31 and Antiq B XIII ch ii sect 5 vol II Now what makes this date and these grants greatly remarkable is the state of the remaining genuine shekels of the Jews with Samaritan characters w iicb seem to have been most of them at least coined in the four first years of this Simon the Asamonean and having upon them these words on one side Jerusalem the holy and on the re verse In the year of freedom 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 which shekels therefore are origmal monuments of these times and undeniable marks of the truth of the history in these chapters though it be in a great measure omitted by Josephus See Essay on the Old Test p 157 158 The reason why I rather suppose that his copy of the Mac cabees wanted these chapters than that his own copies are here imperfect is this that all their contents are not here omitted though much the greatest part be  How Trypho killed this Antiochus the epitome of Livy informs us chap 55 viz that he corrupted his physicians or surgeons who falsely

is evident from his coins which Spanheim assures us bear this inscription Xing Antiochut the God Epiphanes the Victorious Chap VII ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 221 was not admitted by any of the cities on account of Trypho Cleopatra sent to him and invited him to marry her and to take the kingdom The reasons why she made this invitation were these That her friends persuaded her to it and that she was afraid for herself in case some of the people of Seleucia should deliver up the city to Trypho 2 As Antiochus was now come to Seleucia and his forces increased every day he marched to fight Trypho and having beaten him in the battle he ejected him out of thellpper Syria into Phenicia and pursued him thither and besieged him in Dora which was a fortress hard to be taken whither he had fled He also sent ambassadors to Simon the Jewish high priest about a league of friendship and mutual assistance who readily accepted of the invitation and sent to Antiochus great sums of money and provisions for those that besieged Dora and there by supplied them very plentifully so that for a little while he was looked upon as one of his most intimate friends but still Trypho fled from Dora to Apamia where he was taken during the siege and put to death when he had reigned three years 3 However Antiochus forgot the kind assistance that Simon had afforded him in his necessity by reason of his covetous and wicked disposition and committed an army of soldiers to his friend Cendebeus and sent him at once to ravage Judea and to seize Simon When Simon heard of Antiochus breaking his league with him although he were now in years yet pro voked with the unjust treatment he had met with from Antio chus and taking a resolution brisker than his age could well bear he went like a young man to act as general of his army He also sent his sons before among the most hardy of his sol diers and he himself marched on with his army another way and laid many of his men in ambushes in the narrow vallevsi between the mountains nor did he fail of success in any one of his attempts but was too hard for his enemies in every one of them So he led the rest of his life in peace and did also him self make a league with the Romans 4 Now he was the ruler of the Jews in all eight years but at a feast came to his end It was caused by the treachery of his son in law Ptolemy who caught also his wife and two of his sons and kept them in bonds He also sent some to kill John the third son whose name was Hyrcanus  but the young man perceiving them coming he  avoided the danger he  Here Josephus begins to follow and to

from them and made haste into the city Jerusalem as relying on the good will of the multitude because of the bene fits they had received from his father and because of the ha tred the same multitude bare to Ptolemy so that when Ptolemy was endeavouring to enter the city by another gate they drove him away as having already admitted of Hyrcanus CHAP VIII Hyrcanus receives the high priesthood and ejects Ptolemy out of the country Antiochus makes war against Hyrcanus and af terwards makes a league with him Â 1 So Ptolemy retired to one of the fortresses that was above Jericho which was called Dagon but Hyrcanus having taken the priesthood that had been his father s before and in the first place propitiated God by sacrifices he then made an expedition against Ptolenyy and when he made his at tacks upon the place in other points he was too hard for him but was rendered weaker than he by the commiseration he had for his mother and brethren and by that only for Ptolemy brought them upon the wall and tormented them in the sight of all and threatened that he would throw them down headlong unless Hyrcanus would leave off the siege And as he thought that so far as he relaxed as to the siege and taking of the place so much favour did he show to those that were dearest to him by preventing their misery his zeal about it was cooled How ever his mother spread out her hands and begged of him that he would not grow remiss on her account but indulge his in dignation so much the more and that he would do his utmost to take the place quickly in order to get their enemy under his power and then to avenge upon him what he had done to these that were dearest to himself for that death would be to her sweet though with torment if that enemy of theirs might but be brought to punishment for his wicked dealings to them Now when his mother said so he resolved to take the fortress immediately but when he saw her beaten and torn to pieces his courage failed him and he could not but sympathize with what his mother suffered and was thereby overcome And as the siege was drawn out into length by this means that year on which the Jews use to rest came on for the Jews observe this rest every seventh year as they do every seventh day so that Â nd to be now utterly lost See Sixtus Senensis account of it of its many Hebraisms and its great agreement with Josephus abridgment in the

to Zeno who was called Cotylas who was then the tyrant of the city of Philadelphia 2 But Antiochus being very uneasy at the miseries that Simon had brought upon him he invaded Judea in the fourth year of his reign and the first year of the principality of Hyr canus in f the hundred and sixty second Olympiad And when he had burnt the country he shut up Hyrcanus in the city which he encompassed round with seveii encampments but did nothing at the first because of the strength of the walls and because of the valour of the besieged although they were once in want of water which yet they were delivered from by a large shower of rain which fell at the  setting of the Pleiades How ever about the north part of the wall where it happened the city was upon a level with the outward ground the king raised a hundred towers of three stories high and placed bodies of soldiers upon them and as he made his attacks every day he cut a double ditch deep and broad and confined the inhabitants within it as within a wall but the besieged contrived to make frequent sallies out and if the enemy were not any where upon their guard they fell upon them and did them a great deal of mischief and if they perceived them they then retired into the city with ease But because Hyrcanus discerned the inconvenience of so great a number of men in the city while the provisions were the sooner spent by them and yet as is natural to suppose  Hence we learn that in the days of this excellent high priest John Hyrcanus the observation of the Sabbatic year as Josephus supposed required a rest from war as did that of the weekly Sabbath from work I mean this unless in the case of ne cessity when the Jews were attacked by their enemies in which case indeed and in which alone they then allowed defensive fighting to be lawful even on the Sabbath day as we see in several places of Josephus Antiq B XII chap vi Â 2 B XIII chap I Â 2 vol II Of the War B I chap vii Â 2 vol III But then it must be noted that this rest from war no way appears in the first book of Maccabees chap xvi but the direct contrary though indeed the Jews in the days of Antiochus Epiphanes did not venture upon fighting on the Sabbath day even in the defence of their own lives till the Asainonians or Maccabees decreed so to do 1 Mac ii 32â 41 Antiq B XII chap vii sec 2  f Josephus copies both Greek and Latin have here a gross mistake when they say that this first year of John Hyrcanus which we have just now seen to have been a Sabbatic year was in the 162d Olympiad whereas it was for certain the second year of the 161st See the like before B XII chap vi sect 6 J This heliacal setting of the Pleiades or seven stars was in the days of Hyrcanus and Josephus early in the spring about February the time of the latter rain in Judea and this so far as I remember is the only astronomical character of time be sides one eclipse of the moon in the reign of Herod that we meet with in all Jose phus the Jews being little accustomed to astronomical observations any farther than far the uses of their kalendar and utterly forbidden those astrological uses which the heathens commonly made of them 224 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XIII those great numbers did nothing he separated the useless part and excluded them out of the city and retained that part only which were in the flower of their age and fit for war How ever Antiochus would not let those that were excluded go away who therefore wandering about between the walls and consum ing away by famine died miserably but when the feast of ta bernacles was at hand those that were within commiserated their condition and received them in again And when Hyrcanus sent to Antiochus and desired there might be a truce for seven days because of the festival he gave way to his piety towards God and made that truce accordingly and besides that he sent in a magnificent sacrifice bulls with their  horns gilded with all sorts of sweet spices and with cups of gold and silver So those that were at the gates received the sacrifices from those that brought them and led them to the temple Antiochus the meanwhile feasting his army which was a quite different con duct from Antiochus Epiphanes who when he had taken the city he offered swine upon the altar and sprinkled the temple with the broth of their flesh in order to violate the laws of the Jews and the religion they derived from their forefathers for which reason our nation made war with him and would never be reconciled to him but for this Antiochus all men called him Antiochus the Pious for the great zeal he had about re ligion 3 Accordingly Hyrcanus took this moderation of his kindly and when he understood how religious he was towards the Deity he sent an embassage to him and desired that he would restore the settlements they received from their forefathers So he rejected the counsel of those that f would have him utterly destroy the nation by reason of their way of living which was to others unsociable and did not regard what they said But being persuaded that all they did was out of a religious mind he answered the ambassadors That if the besieged would deliver up their arms and pay tribute for Joppa and the other cities which bordered upon Judea and admit a garrison of his on these terms he would make war against them no longer But the Jews although they were content with the other conditions did not agree to admit the garrison because they could not as sociate with other people nor converse with them yet were they willing instead of the admission of the garrison to give him  Dr Hudson tells us here that this custom of gilding the horns of those oxen that were to be sacrificed is a known thing both in the poets and orators f Thiii account in Josephus that the present Antiochus was persuaded though in vain not to make peace with the Jews but to cut them off utterly is fully confirm ed by Diodorus Siculus in I hotius extracts out of his 34th Book Chap IX ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 225 hostages and five hundred talents of silver of which they paid down three hundred and sent the hostages immediately which king Antiochus accepted One of those hostages was Hyr canus brother but still he broke down the fortifications that encompassed the city and upon these conditions Antiochus broke up the siege and departed 4 But Hyrcanus opened the sepulchre of David who excel led all other kings in riches and took out of it three thousand talents He was also the first of the Jews that relying on this wealth maintained foreign troops There was also a league of friendship and mutual assistance made between them Upon which Hyrcanus admitted him into the city and furnished him with whatsoever his army wanted in great plenty and with great generosity and marched along with him when he made an expedition against the Parthians of which Nicolaus of Damas cus is a witness for us who in his history writes thus  When Antiochus had erected a trophy at the river Lycus upon his conquest of Indates the general of the Parthians he stayed there two days It was at the desire of Hyrcanus the Jew be cause it was such a festival derived to them from their fore fathers whereon the law of the Jews did not allow them to travel And truly he did not speak falsely in saying so for that festival which we call Pentecost did then fall out to be the next day to the Sabbath nor is it  lawful for us to jour ney either on the Sabbath day or on a festival day But when Antiochus joined battle with Arsaces the king of Parthia he lost a great part of his army and was himself slain and his brother Demetrius succeeded in the kingdom of Syria by the permission of Arsaces who freed hinvfrom his captivity at the same time that Antiochus attacked Parthia as we have formerly related elsewhere CHAP IX How after the death of Antiochus Hyrcanus made an expedi tion against Syria and made a league with the Romans Con cerning the death of king Demetrius and Alexander  1 JJUT when

neigh bouring places and besides these Shechem and Gerizzim and the nation of the Cutheans who dwelt at the temple which A lexander permitted Sanballat the general of his army to build for the sake of Manasseh who was son in law to Jaddua the high priest as we have formerly related which temple was now deserted two hundred years after it was built Hyrcanus took also Dora and Marissa cities of Idume a and subdued all the Idumeans and permitted them to stay in that country if they would circumcise their genitals and make use of the laws of the Jews and they were so desirous of living in the country of their forefathers that they  submitted to the use of circum cision and of the rest of the Jewish ways of living at which time therefore this befell them that they were hereaiter no other than Jews 2 But Hyrcanus the high priest was desirous to renew that league of friendship they had with the Romans Accordingly he sent an embassage to them and when the senate had received their epistle they made a league of friendship with them after the manner following  Fanius the son of Marcus the pretor gathered the senate together on the eighth day before the ides of February in the senate house when Lucius Manlius the son of Lucius of the Mentine tribe and Caius Sempronius the son of Caius of the Falernian tribe were present The  This account of the Idumeans addmitting circumcision and the entire Jew ish law from this time or from the days of Hyrcanus is confirmed by their entire history afterward See Antiq B XIV ch viii sec I B XV ch vii sec 9 vol II Of the War B II ch iii sec 1 vol III B IV ch iv sec 5 vol IV This in the opinion of Josephus made them proselytes of justice or entire Jews as here and elsewhere Antiq B XIV ch viii sec 1 However Antigonus the enemy of Herod though Herod were derived from such a proselyte of justice for several generations will allow him to be no more than a half Jew B XIV ch xv Â 2 But still take out of Dean Prideaux at the year 129 the words of Ammonias a gram rnarian which fully confirms this account of the Idumeans in Josephus  The Jews says he are such by nature and from the beginning whilst the Idumeans were not Jews from the beginning but Phenicians and Syrians but being afterward subdued by the Jews and compelled to be circumcised and to unite into one na tion and be subject to the same laws they were called Jews Dio also says as the Dean there quotes him from book XXXVI p 37 That country is called Judea and the people Jews and this name is given also to as many others as embrace their religion though of other nations But then upon what foundation so good a governor as Hyrcanus took upon him to compel those Idu means either to become Jews or to leave the country deserves great considera tion I suppose it was because they had long ago been driven out of the land of Edom and seized on and possessed the tribe of Simeon and all the southern parts of the tribe of Judah which was the peculiar inheritance of the worship pers of the true God without idolatry as the reader may learn from Reland Palestine part I p 154 305 and from Prideaux at thejears 140 and 165 Chap IX ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 221 occasion was that the ambassadors sent by the  people of the Jews Simon the son of Dositheus and Apollonius the son of Alexander and Diodorus the son of Jason who were good and virtuous men had somewhat to propose about that league of friendship and mutual assistance which subsisted be tween them and the Romans and about other public affairs who desired that Joppa and the havens and Gazara and the springs of Jordan and the several other cities and countries of theirs which Antiochus had taken from them in the war contrary to the decree of the senate might be restored to them and that it might not be lawful for the king s troops to pass through their country and the countries of those that are subject to them And that what attempts Antiochus had made during that war without the decree of the senate might be made void and that they would send ambassadors who should take care that restitution be made them of what An tiochus had taken from them and that they should make an estimate of the country that had been laid waste in the war and that they would grant them letters of protection to the kings and free people in order to their quiet return home It was therefore decreed as to those points to renew their league of friendship and mutual assistance with these good men and who were sent by a good and a friendly people But that as to the letters desired their answer was that the senate would consult about that matter when their own affairs would give them leave and that they would endeavour for the time to come that no like injury should be done them and that their pretor Fanius should give them money out of the public treasury to bear their expenses home And thus did Fanius dismiss the Jewish ambassadors and gave them money out of the public treasury and gave the decree of the senate to those that were to conduct them and take care that they should return home in safety 3 And thus stood the affairs of Hyrcanus the high priest But as for king Demetrius who had a mind to make war against Hyrcanus there was no opportunity nor room for it while both the Syrians and the soldiers bare ill will to him because he was an ill man But when they had sent ambassadors to Ptolemy who was called Physcon that he would send them one of the fa mily at Seleucus in order to take the kingdom and he had sent them Alexander who was called Zebina with an army and there had been a battle between them Demetrius was beaten in the fight and fled to Cleopatra his wife to Ptolemais but his wife  In this decree of the Roman Senate it seems that these ambassadors were sent from the people of the Jews as well as from their prince or high priest John Hyrcauus vor iI F r 21 228 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS BookXill would not receive him He went thence to Tyre and was there caught and when he had suffered much from his enemies before his death he was slain by them So Alexander took the king dom and made a league with Hyrcanus who yet when he af terward fought with Antiochus the son of Demetrius who was called Grypus was also beaten in the fight and slain CHAP X How upon the quarrel between Antiochus Grypus and Antiochus Cyzicenus about the kingdom Hyrcanus took Samaria and utterly demolished it  and how Hyrcanus joined himself to the sect of the Sadducees and left that of the Pharisees Â 1 VHEN Antiochus had taken the kingdom he was a fraid to make war against Judea because he heard that his bro ther by the same mother who was also called Antiochus was raising an army against him out cf Cyzicum so he staid in his own land and resolved to prepare himself for the attack he ex pected from his brother who was called Cyzicenus because he had been brought up in that city He was the son of Antiochus that was called Soter who died in Parthia He was the bro ther of Demetrius the father of Grypus for it had so happened that one and the same Cleopatra was married to two who were brethren as we have related elsewhere But Antiochus Cyzi cenus coming into Syria continued many years at war with his brother Now Hyrcanus lived all this while in peace for after the death of Antiochus he  revolted from the Macedonians nor did he any longer pay them the least regard either as their subject or their friend but his affairs were in a very improving and flourishing condition in the times of Alexander Zebina and especially under these brethren for the war which they had with one another gave Hyrcanus the opportunity of enjoying himself in Judea quietly insomuch that he got an immense quantity of money However when Antiochus Cyzicenus dis tressed his land he then openly showed what he meant And when he saw that Antiochus was destitute of Egyptian auxiliaries and that both he and his brother were in an ill condition in the struggles they had with one another he despised them both 2 So he made an expedition against Samaria which was a very strong city of whose present name Sebaste and its re building by Herod we shall speak at a proper time but he made  Dean Prideaux lakes notice at the year 130 that Justin in agreement with Josephus says The power of the Jews was now grown so great that after this Antiochus they woutd not bear any Macedonian king over them and that they Se t up a government of their own and infested Syria with groat wars Chap X ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 229 his attack against it and besieged it with a great deal of pains for he was greatly displeased with the Samaritans for the injuries they had done to the people of Merissa a colony of the Jews and confederate with them and this in compliance to the kings of Syria When he had therefore drawn a ditch and built a double wall round the city which were fourscore furlongs long he set his sons Antigonus and Aristobulus over the siege which brought the Samaritans to that great distress by famine that they were forced to eat what used not to be eaten and to call for An tiochus Cyzicenus to help them who came readily to their assist ance but was beaten by Aristobulus and when he was pursued as far as Scythopolis by the two brethren he got away So they returned to Samaria and shut them again within the wall till they were forced to send for the same Antiochus a second time to help them who procured about six thousand men from Pto lemy Lathyrus which were sent them without his mother s consent who had then in a manner turned him out of his go vernment With these Egyptians Antiochus did at first over run and ravage the country of Hyrcanus after the manner of a robber for he durst not meet him in the face to fight with him as not having an army sufficient for that purpose but only from this supposal that by thus harassing his land he should force Hyrcanus to raise the siege of Samaria but because he fell in to snares and lost many of his soldiers therein he went away to Tripoli and committed the prosecution of the war against the Jews to Callimander and Epicrates 3 But as to Callimander he attacked the enemy too rashly and was put to flight and destroyed immediately and as to E picrates he was such a lover of money that he openly betrayed Scythopolis and other places near it to the Jews but was not able to make them raise the siege of Samaria And when Hyr canus had taken that city which was not done till after a year s siege he was not contented with doing that only but he demo lished it entirely and brought rivulets to it to drown it for he dug such hollows as might let the water run under it nay he took away the very marks that there had ever been such a city there Now a very surprising thing is related of this high priest Hyrcanus how God came to discourse with him for they say that on the very same day on which his sons fought with An tiochus Cyzicenus he was alone in the temple as high priest of fering incense and heard a voice that  his sons had just then overcome Antiochus And this he openly declared before all the multitude upon his coming out of the temple and it ac cordingly proved true and in this posture were the affairs of Hyrcanus 230 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XIII 4 Now it happened at this time that not only those Jews who were at Jerusalem and in Judea were in prosperity but also those of them that were at Alexandria and in Egypt and Cyprus for Cleopatra the queen was at variance with her son Ptolemy who was called Lathyrus and appointed for her generals Chel cias and Ananias the sons of that Onias who built the temple in the prefecture of Heliopolis like to that at Jerusalem as we have elsewhere related Cleopatra intrusted these men with her army and did nothing without their advice as Strabo of Capadocia attests when he saith thus  Now the greater part both those that came to Cyprus with us and those that were sent afterward thither revolted to Ptolemy immediately only those that were called Onias party being Jews continued faithful because their countrymen Chelcias and Ananias were in chief favour with the queen These are the words of Strabo 5 However this prosperous state of affairs moved the Jews to envy Hyrcanus but they that were the worst disposed to him were the  Pharisees who were one of the sects of the Jews as we have informed you already These have so great a power over the multitude that when they say any thing against the king or against the high priest they are presently believed Now Hyrcanus was a disciple of theirs and greatly beloved by them And when he once invited them to a feast and entertained them very kindly when he saw them in a good humour he be gan to say to them that they knew he was desirous to be a righteous man and to do all things whereby he might please God which was the profession of the Pharisees also How ever he desired if they observed him offending in any point and going out of the right way they would call him back and correct him On which occasion they attested to his being entirely virtuous with which commendation he was well pleas ed But still there was one of his guests there whose name was  The original of the Sadducees as a considerable party among the Jews being contained in this and the two following sections take Oean Frideaux s note upon this their first public appearance which I suppose to be true Hyrcanus says he went over to the party of the Sadducees that is by embracing the doctrine against the tradition of the elders added to the written law and made of equal authority with it but not their doctrine against the resurrection and a future state for this cannot be supposed of so good and righteous a man as John Hyrcanus is said to be It is most probable that at this time the Sadducees had gone no farther in the doctrines of that sect than to deny all the unwritten traditions which the Pharisees were so fond of for Josephus mentions no other difference at this  time between them neither doth he say that Hyrcanus went over to the Saddu cees in any other particular than in the abolishing of all the traditionary con stitutions of the Pharisees which our Saviour condemned as well as they â At the year 108 Chap X ANTIQUITIES OK THE JEWS 231  Eleazar a man of an ill temper and delighting in seditious practices This man said since thou desirest to know the truth if thou wilt be righteous in earnest lay down the high priesthood and content thyself with the civil government of the people And when he desired to know for what cause he ought to lay down the high priesthood the other replied We have heard it from old men that thy mother had been a captive under the reign of Antiochus Epiphanes This story was false and Hyrcanus was provoked against him and all the Pharisees had a very great indignation against him 6 Now there was one Jonathan a very great friend of Hyr canus but of the sect of the Sadducees whose notions are quite contrary to those of the Pharisees He told Hyrcanus that Eleazar had cast such a reproach upon him according to the common sentiments of all the Pharisees and that this would be made manifest if he would but ask them the question what punishment they thought this man deserved for that he might depend upon it that the reproach was not laid on him with their approbation if they were for punishing him as his crime de served So the Pharisees made answer that  he deserved stripes and bonds but that it did not seem right to punish re proaches with death And indeed the Pharisees even upon other occasions are not apt to be severe in punishments At this gentle sentence Hyrcanus was very angry and thought that this man reproached him by their approbation It was this Jona than who chiefly irritated him and influenced him so far that he made him leave the party of the Pharisees and abolish the decrees they had imposed on the people and to punish those that observed them From this source arose that hatred which he and his sons met with from the multitude but of these matters we shall speak hereafter What I would now explain is this that the Pharisees have delivered to the people a great many ob servances by succession from their fathers which are not writ ten in the laws of Moses and for that reason it is that the Sad ducees reject them and say that we are to esteem those observ ances to be obligatory which are in the written word but are not to observe what are derived from the tradition of our fore fathers And concerning these things it is that great disputes and differences have arisen among them while the Sadducees are able to persuade none but the rich and have not the populace obsequious to them but the Pharisees have the multitude on  This slander that arose from a Pharisee has been preserved by their successors the Rabbins to these later ages for Dr Hudson assures us that David Gantz in bis Chronology S pr p 77 in Vorstius version relates that

the second book of Jewish affairs 7 But when Hyrcanus had put an end to this sedition he after that lived happily and administered the government in the best manner for thirty one years and then  died leaving behind him five sons He was esteemed by God worthy of the three greatest privileges the government of his nation the dignity of the high priesthood and prophecy for God was with him and enabled him to know futurities and to foretell this in particular that as to his two eldest sons he foretold that they would not long continue in the government of public af fairs whose unhappy catastrophe will be worth our description that we may thence learn how very much they were inferior to their father s happiness CHAP XI Hem Aristobulus when he had taken the government first of all put a diadem on his head and was most barbarously cruel to his mother and his brethren and how after he had slain Antigonus he himself died Â 1 Now when their father Hyrcanus was dead the eldest son Aristobulus intending to change the government into a kingdom for so he resolved to do first of all put a diadem  Here ends the high priesthood and the life of this excellent person John Hyrcanus and together with him the holy theocracy or divine government of the Jewish nation and its concomitant oracle by Prim Now follows the profane and tyrannical Jewish monarchy first of the Assamonians or Maccabees and then of Herod the Great the Idumean till the coming of the Messiah See the note on Antiq B III chap viii sect 9 Hear Strabo s testimony on this occasion B XVI page 761 762 Those says he that succeeded Moses continued for some time in earnest both in righteous actions and in piety but after a while there were others that took upon them the high priesthood at first superstitious and afterwards tyrannical persons Such a prophet was Moses and those that suc ceeded him beginning in a way not to be blamed but changing for the worse And when it openly appeared that the government was become tyrannical Alex ander was the first that set up himself for a king instead of a priest and his sons were Hyrcanus and Aristobulus All in agreement with Josephus excepting this that Srabo omits the first king Aristobulus whose reign being but a single year seems haidly to have come to his knowledge Nor indeed does Aristobulus the son of Alexander pretend that the name of long was taken before his father Alexander took it himself Antiq B XIV chap iii sect 2 See also chap xii sect 1 which favour Strabo also And indeed if we may judge from the very different characters of the Egyptian Jews under high priests and of the Palestine Jews under kings in the two next centuries we may well suppose that the divine Shechinah was removed into Egypt and that the worshippers at the temple of Onias were better men than those at the temple of Jersualem Chap XI ANTIQUITIES OF THti JEWS 2SS on his head four hundred eighty and one years and three months after the people had been delivered from the Babylonish slavery and were returned to their own country again This Aristobulus loved his next brother Antigonus and treated him as his equal but the others he held in bonds He also cast his mother into prison because she disputed the government with him for Hyrcanus had left her to be mistress of all He also proceeded to that degree of barbarity as to kill her in prison with hunger nay he was alienated from his brother Antigo nus by calumnies and added him to the rest whom he slew yet he seemed to have an affection for him and made him above the rest a partner with him in the kingdom Those calumnies he at first did not give credit to partly because he loved him and so did not give heed to what was said against him and partly because he thought the reproaches were derived from the envy of the relaters But when Antigonus was once returned from the army and that feast was then at hand when they make ta bernacles to the honour of God it happened that Aristobulus was fallen sick and that Antigonus went up most splendidly adorned and with his soldiers about him in their armour to the temple to celebrate the feast and to put up many prayers for the recovery of his brother when some wicked persons who had a great mind to raise a difference between the breth ren made use of this opportunity of the pompous appearance of Antigonus and of the great actions which he had done and went to the king and spitefully aggravated the pompous show of his at the feast and pretended that all these circumstances were not like those of a private person that these actions were indications of an affectation of royal authority and that his coming with a strong body of men must be with an intention to kill him and that his way of reasoning was this that it was a silly thing in him while it was in his power to reign himself to look upon it as a great favour that he was honoured with a lower dignity by his brother 2 Aristobulus yielded to these imputations but took c re both that his brother should not suspect him and that he him self might not run the hazard of his own safety so he ordered his guards to lie in a certain place that was underground and dark he himself then lying sick in the tower which was called Antonia and he commanded them that in case Antigonus came in to him unarmed they should not touch any body but if armed they should kill him yet did he send to Antigonus and desired that he would come unarmed But the queen and those that joined with her in the plot against Antigonus per suaded the messenger to tell him the direct contrary How his brother had heard that he had made himself a fine suit of armour 234  ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XIII for war and desired him to come to him in that armour that he might see how fine it was So Antigonus suspecting no treach ery but depending on the good will of his brother came to Aristobulus armed as he used to be with his entire armour in order to show it to him but when he was come at a place which was called Strato s Tower where the passage happened to be exceeding dark the guards slew him which death of his demonstrates that nothing is stronger than envy and calumny and that nothing does more certainly divide the good will and natural affections of men than those passions But here one may take occasion to wonder at one Judas who was of the sect of tlie Essens and who never missed the truth in his predictions for this man when he saw Antigonus passing by the temple cried out to his companions and friends who abode with him as his  scholars in order to learn the art of foretelling things to come That it was good for him to die now since he had spoken falsely about Antigonus who is still alive and I see him passing by although he had foretold he should die at the place called Strato s Tower that very day while yet the place is six hundred furlongs off where he had foretold he should be slain and still this day is a great part of it already past so that he was in danger of proving a false prophet As he was saying this and that in a melancholy mood the news came that Antigonus was slain in a place under ground which itself was called also Strato s Tower or of the same name with that Cesarea which is seated at the sea This event put the prophet into a great disorder 3 But Aristobulus repented immediately of this slaughter of his brother on which account his disease increased upon him and he was disturbed in his mind upon the guilt of such wick edness insomuch that his entrails were corrupted by his intol erable pain and he vomited blood at which time one of the servants that attended upon him and was carrying his blood away did by divine providence as I cannot but suppose slip down and shed part of his blood at the very place where there were spots of Antigonus blood there slain still remaining and when there was a cry made by the spectators as if the ser vant had on purpose shed the blood on that place Aristobulus heard it and inquired what the matter was And as they did not answer him he was the more earnest to know what it  Hence we learn that the Essens pretended to have rules whereby men might foreteli things to come and that this Judas the Essen taught those rules to his scholars but whether their pretences were of an astrological or magical nature which yet in such religious Jews who were utterly forbidden such ans is no way probable or to any Bath Col spoken of by the latter Rabbins or otherwise I can not tell See of the War B II chap viii sect 12 vol III Chap XII ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 235 was it being natural to men to suspect that what is thus con cealed is very bad so upon his threatening and forcing them by terrors to speak they at length told him the truth where upon he shed many tears in that disorder of mind which arose from his consciousness of what he had done and gave a deep groan and said I am not therefore I perceive to be con cealed from God in the impious and horrid crimes I have been guilty of but a sudden punishment is coming upon me for the shedding the blood of my relations And now O thou most impudent body of mine how long wilt thou re tain a soul that ought to die in order to appease the ghosts of my brother and my mother Why dost thou not give it all up at once And why do I deliver up my blood drop by drop to those whom I have so wickedly murdered In say ing which last words he died having reigned a year He was called a lover of the Grecians and had conferred many benefits on his own country and made war against Iturea and added a great part of it to Judea and compelled the inhabitants if they would continue in that country to be circumcised and to live according to the Jewish laws He was naturally a man of can dour and of great modesty as Strabo bears witness in the name of Timagenes who says thus This man was a person of candour and very serviceable to the Jews for he added a country to them and obtained a part of the nation of the Itu reans for them and bound them to them by the bond of the circumcision of their genitals CHAP XII Hew Alexander when he had taken the government made an expedition against Ptolemais and then raised the siege out of fear of Ptolemy Lathyrus and how Ptolemy made war against him because he had sent to Cleopatra to persuade her to make war against Ptolemy and yet pretended to be in friendship with him when he beat the Jews in the battle 1 VV HEN Aristobulus was dead his wife Salome who by the Greeks was called Alexandra let his brethren out of prison for Aristobulus had kept them in bonds as we have said already and made Alexander Janneus king who was the supe rior in age and in moderation This child happened to be hated by his father as soon as he was born and could never be permitted to come into his father s sight till he died The oc casion of which hatred is thus reported When Hyrcanus chiefly loved the two eldest of his sons Anjigonus and Aristobulus God appeared to him in his sleep of whom he inquired which VOL n oc 23 2S6 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XIII of his sons should be his successor Upon God s representing to him the countenance of Alexander he was grieved that he was to be the heir of all his goods and suffered him to be brought up in  Galilee However God did not deceive Hyr canus for after the death of Aristobulus he certainly took the kingdom and one of his brethren who affected the kingdom he slew and the other who chose to live a private and quiet life he had in esteem 2 When Alexander Janneus had settled the government in the manner that he judged best he made an expedition against Ptolemais and having overcome the men in battle he shut them up in the city and sat round about it and besieged it for of the maritime cities there remained only Ptolemais and Gaza to be conquered besides Strato s Tower and Dora which were held by the tyrant Zoilus Now while Antiochus Phih meter and Antiochus who was called Cyzicenus were making war one against another and destroying one another s armies the people of Ptolemais could have no assistance from them but when they were distressed with this siege Zoilus who possessed Strato s Tower and Dora and maintained a legion of soldiers and on occasion of the contest between the kings affected tyran ny himself came and brought some small assistance to the peo ple of Ptolemais nor indeed had the kings such a friendship for them as that they should hope for any advantage from them Both these kings were in the case of wrestlers who rinding themselves deficient in strength and yet being ashamed to yield put off the fight by laziness and by lying still as long as they could The only hope they had remaining was from the king of Egypt and from Ptolemy Lathyrus who now held Cyprus and who came to Cyprus when he was driven from the govern ment of Egypt by Cleopatra his mother So the people of Pto lemais sent to this Ptolemy Lathyrus and desired him to come as a confederate to deliver them now they were in such dan ger out of the hands of Alexander And as the ambassadors gave him hopes that if he would pass over into Syria he would have the people of Gaza on the side of those of Ptolemnis as also they said that Zoilus and besides these the Sidonians and many others would assist them so he was elevated at this and got his fleet ready as soon as possible 3 But in this interval Demenetus one that was of abilities  The reason why Hyrcanus suffered not this son of his whom he did not love to come to Judta but ordered him to be brought up in Galilee is su gesifd V ur Hudson that Galilee was not esteemed so happy and well cultivated a country as Judea Matt xxvi 73 John vii 52 Acts ii 7 although another obvious iva nr occurs also that he was farther out of his sight in Galilee than be would have been in Judea Chap XII ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 237 to persuade men to do as he would have them and a leader of the populace made those of Ptolemais change their opinions and said to them That  it was better to run the hazard of be ing subject to the Jews than to admit of evident slavery by delivering themselves up to a master and besides that to have not only a war at present but to expect a much greater war from Egypt for that Cleopatra would not overlook an army raised by Ptolemy for himself out of the neighbourhood but would come against them with a great army of her own and this because she was labouring to eject her son out of Cy prus also that as for Ptolemy if he fail of his hopes he can still retire to Cyprus but that they will be left in the greatest danger possible Now Ptolemy although he had heard of the change that was made in the people of Ptolemais yet did he still go on with his voyage and came to the country called Sy camine and there set his army on shore This army of his in the whole horse and foot together were about thirty thousand with which he marched near to Ptolemais and there pitched his camp But when the people of Ptolemais neither received his ambassadors nor would hear what they had to say he was un  der a very great concern 4 But when Zoilus and the people of Gaza came to him and desired his assistance because their country was laid waste by the Jews and by Alexander Alexander raised the seige for fear of Ptolemy And when he had drawn off his army into his own country he used a stratagem afterwards by privately inviting Cleopatra to come against Ptolemy but publicly pretending to desire a league of friendship and mutual assistance with him and promising to give him four hundred talents of silver he desired that by way of requital he would take off Zoilus the tyrant and give his country to the Jews And then indeed Ptolemy with pleasure made such a league of friendship with Alexander and subdued Zoilus but when he afterward heard that he had privily sent to Cleopatra his mother he broke the league with him which yet he had confirmed with an oath and fell upon him and besieged Ptolemais because it would not receive him However leaving his generals with some part of his forces to go on with the siege he went himself immediately with the rest to lay Judea waste  and when Alexander understood this to be Ptolemy s intention he also got together about fifty thousand soldiers out of his own country nay  as some writers have  From these and otjier occasional expressions dropped by Josephus we may learn that where the sacred books of the Jews were deficient he had several other histories then extant but now most of them lost which he faithfully followed in his own history â Nor indeed have we any other records of those times relating to Judea that can be compared to these accounts of Josej hus though when we do meet with authen tic fragments of such original records they do almost always confirm his history 238 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XIII said eighty thousand He then took his army and went to meet Ptolemy but Ptolemy fell upon Assochis a city of Ga lilee and took it by force on the sabbath day and there he took about ten thousand slaves and a great deal of other prey 5 He then tried to take Sepphoris which was a city not far from that which was destroyed but lost many of his men yet did he then go to fight with Alexander which Alexander met him at the river Jordan near a certain place called Sappoth not far from the river Jordan and pitched his camp near to the enemy He had however eight thousand in the first rank which he stiled Hecatontomachi having shields of brass Those in the first rank of Ptolemy s soldiers also had shields covered with brass but Ptolemy s soldiers in other respects were in ferior to those of Alexander and therefore were more fearful of running hazards but Philostephanus the camp master put great courage into them and ordered them to pass the river which was between their camps Nor did Alexander think fit to hinder their passage over it for he thought that if the ene my had once gotten the river on their back that he should the easier take them prisoners when they could not flee out of he battle In the beginning of which the acts on both sides with their hands and with their alacrity were alike and a great slaughter was made by both the armies but Alexander was su perior till Philostephanus opportunely brought up the auxili aries to help those that were giving way but as there were no auxiliaries to afford help to that part of the Jews that gave way it fell out that they fled and those near them did not assist them but fled along with them However Ptolemy s soldiers acted quite otherwise for they followed the Jews and killed them till at length those that slew them pursued after them when they had made them all run away and slew them so long that their weapons of iron were blunted and their hands quite tired with the slaughter for the report was that thirty thousand men were then slain Timagenes says they were fifty thousand As for the rest they were part of them taken captives and the other part ran away to their own country 6 After this victory Ptolemy overran all the country and when night came on he abode in certain villages of Judea which when he found full of women and children he commanded his soldiers to strangle them and to cut them in pieces and then to cast them into boiling caldrons and then to devour their limbs as sacrifices This commandment was given that such as fled from the battle and came to them might suppose their enemies were cannibals and eat men s flesh and might on that account be still more terrified at them upon such a sight And both Strabo and Nicholaus of Damascus affirm that they used Chap XIII ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 239 these people after this manner as I have already related Ptolemy also took Ptolemais by force as we have declared elsewhere CHAP XIII How Alexander upon the league of mutual defence which Cleo patra had agreed with him made an expedition against Cele syria and utterly overthrew the city of Gaza  and how he slew many ten thousands of Jews that rebelled against him Also concerning Antiochus Grypus Seleucus Antiochus Cyzicenus and Antiochus Pius and others Â 1 W HEN Cleopatra saw that her son was grown great and laid Judea waste without disturbance and had gotten the eity of Gaza under his power she resolved no longer to overlook what he did when he was almost at her gates and she concluded that now he was so much stronger than before he would be very desirous of the dominion over the Egyptians but she immediately marched against him with a fleet at sea and an army of foot on land and made Chelsias and Ananias the Jews generals of her whole army while she sent the greatest part of her riches her grand children and her testament to the people of  Cos Cleopatra also ordered her son Alexander to sail with a great fleet to Phenicia and when that country had revolted she came to Ptolemais and because the people of Pto lemais did not receive her she besieged the city but Ptolemy went out of Syria and made haste into Egypt supposing that he should find it destitute of an army and soon take it though he failed of his hopes At this time Chelcias one of Cleopatra s generals happened to die in Celesyria as he was in pursuit of Ptolemy 2 When Cleopatra heard of her son s attempt and that his Egyptian expedition did not succeed according to his expecta tions she sent thither part of her army and drove him out of that country so when he was returried out of Egypt again he abode during the winter at Gaza in which time Cleopatra took the garrison that was in Ptolemais by siege as well as the city and when Alexander came to her he gave her presents and such marks of respect as were but proper since under the miseries he endured by Ptolemy he had no other refuge but her  The city or island Cos is not that remote island in the Egean Sea famous for the birth of the great Hippocrates but a city or island of the same name adjoining to Kgypt mentioned both by Stephanus and Ptolemy as Dr Hudson informs us Of which Cos and the treasures there laid up by Cleopatra and the Jews see Antiq B XIV ch vii Â 2 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS BookXIII Now there were some of her friends who persuaded her to seize Alexander and to overrun and take possession of the country and not to sit still and see such a multitude of brave Jews sub ject to one man But Ananias counsel was contrary to theirs who said that she would do an unjust action if she deprived a man that was her ally of that authority which belonged to him and this a man who is related to us for said he I would not have thee ignorant of this that what injustice thou dost to him will make all us that are Jews to be thy enemies This desire of Ananias Cleopatra complied with and did no injury to Alexander but made a league of mutual assistance with him at Scythopolis a city of Celesyria 3 So when Alexander was delivered from the fear he was in of Ptolemy he presently made an expedition against Celesyria He also took Gadara after a siege often months He took also Amathus a very strong fortress belonging to the inhabitants above Jordan where Theodorus the son of Zeno had his chief treasure and what he esteemed most precious This Zeno fell unexpectedly upon the Jews and slew ten thousand of them and seized upon Alexander s baggage Yet did not this misfortune terrify Alexander but he made an expedition upon the maritime parts of the country Raphia and Anthedon the name of which king Herod afterwards changed to Agrippias and took even that by force but when Alexander saw that Ptolemy was retired from Gaza to Cyprus and his mother Cleopatra was returned to Egypt he grew angry at the people of Gaza because they had invited Ptolemy to assist them and besieged their city and ra vaged their country But as Apollodotus the general of the army of Gaza fell upon the camp of the Jews by night with two thousand foreign and ten thousand of his own forces while the night lasted those of Gaza prevailed because the enemy was made to believe that it was Ptolemy who attacked them but when day was come on and that mistake was corrected and the Jews knew the truth of the matter they came back again and fell upon those of Gaza and slew of them about a thousand but as those of Gaza stoutly resisted them and would not yield for ci ther their want of any thing nor for the great multitude that were slain for they would rather suffer any hardship whatever than come under the power of their enemies Aretus king of the Arabians a person then very illustrious encouraged them to go on with alacrity and promised them that he would come to their assistance but it happened that before he came Apollodotus was slain for his brother Lysimachus envying him for the great reputation he had gained among the citizens slew him and got the army together and delivered up the city to Alexander who when he came in at first lay quiet and afterward set his army Chap XIII ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 241 upon the inhabitants of Gaza and gave them leave to punish them so some went one way and some went another and slew the inhabitants of Gaza yet were not they of cowardly hearts but opposed those that came to slay them and slew as many of the Jews and some of them when they saw themselves de serted burnt their own houses that the enemy might get none of their spoils nay some of them with their own hands slew their children and their wives having no other way but this of avoiding slavery for them but the senators who were in all five hundred fled to Apollo s temple for this attack happened to be made as they were sitting whom Alexander slew and when he had utterly overthrown their city he returned to Je rusalem having spent a year in that siege 4c About this very time  Antiochus who was called Gry pus died His death was caused by Heracleon s treachery when he had lived forty five years and had reigned f twenty nine His son Seleucus succeeded him in his kingdom and made war with Antiochus his father s brother who was called Antiochus Cyzicenus and beat him and took him prisoner and slew him But after a while  Antiochus the son of Cyzicenus who was called Pius came to Aradus and put the diadem on his own head and made war with Seleucus and beat him and drove him out of all Syria But when he fled out of Syria he came to Mop suestia again and levied money upon them but the people of Mopsuestia had indignation at what he did and burnt down his palace and slew him together with his friends But when Antiochus the son of Cyzicenus was king of Syria Â Antiochus the brother of Seleucus made war upon him and was overcome and destroyed he and his army After him his brother Philip put on the diadem and reigned over some part of Syria but Ptolemy Lathyrus sent for his fourth brother De metrius who was called Eucerus from Cnidus and made him king of Damascus Both these brothers did Antiochus vehe mently oppose but presently died for when he was come as an auxiliary to Laodice  queen of the Gileadites when she was  This account of the death of Antiochus Grypus is confirmed by Appian Syriac p 152 here cited by Spanheim f Porphyry says that this Antiochui Grypus reigned but 26 years as Dr Hudson observes  The copies of Josepbus both Greek and Latin have here so grossly false a reading Antiochus and Antoninus or Antanms Plus for Antiochus J ius that the editors are forced to correct the text from the other historians who all agree that this king s name was nothing more than Antiochus Pius Â These two brothers Antiochus and Philippus are called twins by Porphyry the fourth brother was king of Damascus Both which are the observations of Spanheim  This Laodicea was a c ty of Gilead beyond Jordan However Porphyry 2 2 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XIII making war against the Parthians and as he was fighting cour ageously he tell while Demetrius and Philip governed Syria as hath been elsewhere related 5 As to Alexander his own people were seditious against him for at a festival which was then celebrated when he stood upon the altar and was going to sacrifice the nation rose upon him and pelted him with citrons which they then had in their hands because the law of the Jews required that at the feast of tabernacles every one should have branches of the palm tree and citron tree which thing we have elsewhere related They also reviled him as  derived from a captive and so unworthy of his dignity and of sacrificing At this he was in a rage and slew of them about six thousand He also built a parti tion wall of wood round the altar and the temple as far as that partition within which it was only lawful for the priests to enter and by this means he obstructed the multitude from coming at him He also maintained foreigners of Pisidiae and Cilicia for as to the Syrians he was at war with them and so made no use of them He also overcame the Arabians such as the Moabites and Gileadites and made them bring tribute Moreover he demolished Amathus while f Theodorus durst not fight with him but as he had joined battle with Obedas king of the Arabians and fell into an ambush in the places that were rugged and difficult to be travelled over he was thrown down into a deep valley by the multitude of the camels at Ga dara a village of Gilead and hardly escaped with his life From thence he fled to Jerusalem where besides his other ill success the nation insulted him and he fought against them for six years and slew no fewer than fifty thousand of them And when he desired that they would desist from their ill will to him they hated him so much the more on account of what had already happened and when he had asked them what he ought to do they all cried out that he ought to kill himself They also sent to Demetrius Eucerus and desired him to make a league of mutual defence with them says that this Antiochus Pius did rot die in this battle but running away was drowned in the river Orontes Appian says that he was deprived of the kingdom of Syria by Tigraties but Porphyry makes this Loadice Queen of the Calamansâ All which is noted by Spanheim In such confusion of the latter historians we have no reason to prefer any of them before Josephus who had more original ones before him Â  This reproach upon Alexander that he was sprung from a captive seems only the repetition of the old Pharisaical calumny upon his father chap x sect v f This Theodorus was the son of Zeno and was in possession of Amathus as we learn from sect 3 foregoing Chap XIV ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS CHAP XIV Hole Demetrius Eucerus overcame Alexander and yet in a little time retired out of the country for fear of the Jews As also how Alexander slew many of the Jews and thereby got clear of his troubles Concerning the death of Demetrius Â 1 So Demetrius came with an army and took those that invited him and pitched his camp near the city Shechem  upon which Alexander with his six thousand two hundred mercena ries and about twenty thousand Jews who were of his party went against Demetrius who had three thousand horsemen and forty thousand footmen Now there were great endeavours used on both sides Demetrius trying to bring off the mercena ries that were with Alexander because they were Greeks and Alexander trying to bring off the Jews that were with Demetri us However when neither of them could persuade them so to do they came to a battle and Demetrius was the conqueror in which all Alexander s mercenaries were killed when they had given demonstration of their fidelity and courage A great number of Demetrius soldiers were slain also 2 Now as Alexander fled to the mountains six thousand of the Jews hereupon came together from Demetrius to him out of pity at the change of his fortune upon which Demetrius vas afraid and retired out of the country after which the Jews fought against Alexander and being beaten were slain in great numbers in the several battles which they had and when he had shut up the most powerful of them in the city Bethome he be sieged them therein and when he had taken the city and gotten the men into his power he brought them to Jerusalem and did one of the most barbarous actions in the world to them for as he was feasting with his concubines in the sight of all the city he ordered about eight hundred of them to be crucified and while they were living he ordered the throats of their children and wives to be cut before their eyes This was indeed by way of revenge for the injuries they had done him which punish ment yet was of an inhuman nature though we suppose that he had been ever so much distressed as indeed he had been by his wars with them for he had by their means come to the last degree of hazard both of his life and of his kingdom while they were not satisfied by themselves only to fight against him but introduced foreigners also for the same purpose nay at length they reduced him to that degree of necessity that he was forced to deliver back to the king of Arabia the land of Moab and Gilead which he had subdued and the places that were in them that they might not join with them in the war against him VOL II H H 23 244 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XIII as they had done ten thousand other things that tended to affront and reproach him However this barbarity seems to have been without any necessity on which account he bare the name of a Thraciun  among the Jews whereupon the soldiers that had fougkt against him being about eight thousand in number ran away by night and continued fugitives all the time that Alexan der lived who being now freed from any farther disturbance from them reigned the rest of his time in the utmost tranquillity 3 But when Demetrius was departed out of Judea he went to Berea and besieged his brother Philip having with him ten thousand footmen and a thousand horsemen However Strato the tyrant of Berea the confederate of Philip called in Zizon the ruler of the Arabian tribes and Mithridates Sinax the ru ler of the Parthians who coming with a great number offerees and besieging Demetrius in his encampment into which they had driven him with their arrows they compelled those that were with him by thirst to deliver up themselves So they took a great many spoils out of that country and Demetrius himself whom they sent to Mithridates who was then king of Parthia but as to those whom they took captives of the people of Anti och they restored them to the Antiochians without any reward Now Mithridates the king of Parthia had Demetrius in great honour till Demetrius ended his life by sickness So Philip presently after the fight was over came to Antioch and took it and reigned over Syria CHAP XV Hem Antiochus who leas called Dionysus and after him Aretas made expeditions into Judea  as also how Alexander took many cities and then returned to Jerusalem and after a sick ness of three years died and what counsel he gave to Alexandra Â 1 AFTER this Antiochus who was called f Dionysus and was Philip s brother aspired to the dominion and came to Damascus and got the power into his hands and there he reigned but as he was making war against the Arabians his brother Philip heard of it and came to Damascus where Mile sius who had been left

rewarded him as he ought to have done he be came suspected by him and so he was obliged to leave Damascus again for Melesius caught him marching out into the Hippo drome and shut him up in it and kept Damascus for Antiochus Eucerus who hearing how Philip s affairs stood came back out of Arabia He also came immediately and made an expedition against Judea with eight thousand armed footmen and eight hun dred horsemen So Alexander out of fear of his coming dug a deep ditch beginning at Chabarzaba which is now called An tipatris to the sea of Joppa on which part only his army could be brought against him He also raised a wall and erected wood en towers and intermediate redoubts for one hundred and fifty furlongs in length and there expected the coming of Antiochus but he soon burnt them all and made his army pass by that way into Arabia The Arabian king Aretas at first retreated but afterward appeared on the sudden with ten thousand horsemen Antiochus gave them the meeting and fought desperately and indeed when he had gotten the victory and was bringing some auxiliaries to that part of his army that was in distress he was slain When Antiochus was fallen his army fled to the village Cana where the greatest part of them perished by famine 2 After him  Aretas reigned over Celesyria being called to the government by those that held Damascus by reason of the hatred they bare to Ptolemy Menneus He also made thence an expedition against Judea and beat Alexander in battle near a place called Adida yet did he upon certain conditions agreed on between them retire out of Judea

of Regaba a fortress beyond Jordan But when his queen saw that he was ready to die and had no longei any hopes of surviving she came to him weeping and lamenting and bewailed herself and her sons on the desolate condition they should be left in and said to him  To whom dost thou thus leave me and my children who are destitute of all other sup ports and this when thou knowest how much ill will thy na tion bears thee But he gave her the following advice  That she need but follow what he would suggest to her in order to retain the kingdom securely with her children that she  should conceal his death from the soldiers till she should have taken that place after this she should go in triumph as upon a victory to Jerusalem and put some of her authority into the hands of the Pharisees for that they would commend her for the honour she had done them and would reconcile the na tion to her for he told her they had great authority among the Jews both to do hurt to such as they hated and to bring advan tages to those to whom they weie friendly disposed for that they are then believed best of all by the multitude when they speak any severe thing against others though it be only out of envy at them And he said that it was by their means that he had incurred the displeasure of the nation whom indeed he had in  We may here and elsewhere take notice that whatever countries or cities the Asamonians conquered from any of the neighbouring nations or whatever coun tries or cities they gained from them that had not belonged to them before they after the days of Hyrcanus compelled the inhabitants to leave their idolatry and entirely to receive the law of Moses as proselytes of justice or else banish them into other lands That excellent prince John Hyrcanus did it to the Idumeans

severely suffered by my means or whether in their anger they will offer any other injury to that body Promise them also that thou wilt do nothing without them in the affairs of the kingdom If thou dost but say this to them I shall have the honour of a more glorious funeral from them than thou couldst have made for me and when it is in their power to abuse my dead body they will do it no injury at all and thou wilt rule in safety So when he had given his wife this advice he died after he had reigned twenty seven years and lived fifty years within one CHAP XVI How Alexandra by gaining the good will of the Pharisees re tained the kingdom nine years and then having done many glo rious actions died Â 1 oo Alexandra when she had taken the fortress acted as her husband had suggested to her and spake to the Pharisees and put all things into their power both as to the dead body  It serins by this dying advice of Alexander Janneus to his wife that he had himself pursued the measures of his father Hyrcanus and taken part with the Sad ducees who kept close to the written law against the Pharisees who hud intro duced their own traditions  xvi Â 2 and that he now saw a political necessity of submitting to the Pharisees and their traditions hereafter if his widow and family minded to retain their monarchial government or tyranny over the Jewish nation Which sect yet thus supported were at least in great measure the ruin of the re ligion government and nation of the Jews and brought them into so wicked a state that the vengeance of God came upon them to their utter excision Just thus did Caiaphas politically advise the Jewish sanhedrim John xi 50 That it was expedi ent for them that one man should die for the people and that the whole nation perish not and this in consequence of their own political supposal ver 48 that If they let Jesus alone with his miracles all mm would believe on him and the Ramans would come and take away both their place and nation Which political cruciBxion of Je sus of Nazareth brought down the vengeance of God upon them and occasioned those very Romans of whom they seemed so much afraid that to prevent it they put him to death actually to come and take away both their place and nation within 38 years afterwards I heartily wish the politicians of Christendom would consider these and the like examples and no longer sacrifice all virtue and religion to their pernicious schemes of government to the bringing down the judgment of God upon themselves and the several nations entrusted to their care But this is a di gression I wish it were an unseasonable one also Josephus himself several times makes such digressions and I here venture to follow him See one of them at the conclusion of the very next chapter 248 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XIII and as to the affairs of the kingdom and thereby pacified their anger against Alexander and made them bear good will and friendship to him who then came among the multitude and made speeches to them and laid before them the actions of Alex ander and told them that they had lost a righteous king and by the commendation they gave him they brought them to grieve and to be in heaviness for him so that he had a funeral more splendid than had any of the kings before him Alexander left behind him two sons Hyrcanus and Aristobulus but com mitted the kingdom to Alexandra Now as to these two sons Hyrcanus was indeed unable to manage public affairs and de lighted rather in a quiet life but the younger Aristobulus was an active and a bold man and for this woman herself Alexandra she was loved by the multitude because she seemed displeased at the offences her husband had been guilty of 2 So she made Hyrcanus high priest because he was the elder but much more because he cared not to meddle with poli tics and permitted the Pharisees to do every thing to whom also she ordered the multitude to be obedient She also restored again those practices which the Pharisees had introduced ac cording to the traditions of their forefathers and which her father in law Hyrcanus had abrogated So she had indeed the name of the Regent but the Pharisees had the authority for it was they who restored such as had been banished and set such as were prisoners at liberty and to say all at once they differed in nothing from lords However the queen also took care of the affairs of the kingdom and got together a great body of mercenary soldiers and increased her own army to such a de gree that she became terrible to the neighbouring tyrants and took hostages of them And the country was entirely at peace excepting the Pharisees for they disturbed the queen and de sired that she should kill those who persuaded Alexander to slay the eight hundred men after which they cut the throat of one of them Diogenes and after him they did the same to several one after another till the men that were the most potent came into the palace and Aristobulus with them for he seemed to be displeased at what was done and it appeared openly that if he had an opportunity he would not permit his mother to go on so These put the queen in mind what great dangers they had gone through and great things they had done whereby they had demonstrated the firmness of their fidelity to their master insomuch that they had received the greatest marks of favour from him and they begged of her that she would not ut terly blast their hopes as it now happened that when they had escaped the hazards that arose from their open enemies they were to be cut off at home by their private enemies Chap XVI ANTigmTiES OF THE JEWS 249 like brute beasts without any help whatsoever They said also that if their adversaries would be satisfied with those that had been slain already they would take what had been done patiently on account of their natural love to their go vernors but if they must expect the same for the future also they implored of her a dismission from her service for they could not bear to think of attempting any method for their deliverance without her but would rather die willingly before the palace gate in case she would not forgive them And that it was a great shame both for themselves and for the queen that when they were neglected by her they should come under the lash of her husband s enemies for that Are tas the Arabian king and the monarchs would give any reward if they could get such men as foreign auxiliaries to whom their very names before their voices be heard may perhaps be terrible But if they could not obtain this their second request and if she had determined to prefer the Pha risees before them they still insisted that she would place them every one in her fortresses for if some fatal demon had a constant spite against Alexander s house they would be will ing to bear their part and to live in a private station there 3 As these men said thus and called upon Alexander s ghost for commiseration of those already slain and those in danger of it all the bystanders broke out into tears But Aristobulus chiefly made manifest what were his sentiments and used many reproachful expressions to his mother saying Nay indeed the case is this that they have been themselves the authors of their own calamities who have permitted a woman who against reason was mad with ambition to reign over them when there were sons in the flower of their age fitter for it So Alexandra not knowing what to do with any decency com mitted the fortresses to them all but Hyrcania and Alexan drium and Macherus where her principal treasures were After a little while also she sent her son Aristobulus with an army to Damascus against Ptolemy who was called Menneus who was such a bad neighbour to the city but he did nothing considerable there and so returned home 4 About this time news was brought that Tigranes the king of Armenia had made an irruption into Syria with  five hun dred thousand soldiers and was coming against Judea This news  The number of 500 000 or even 300 000 as one Greek copy with the Latin copies have it Tigranes army that came out of Armenia into Syria and Judea seems much too large We have had already several such extravagant numbers in Josephus present copies which are not to be at all ascribed to him Accordingly I incline to Dr Hudson s emendation here which supposes them but 40 000 250 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XIII as may well be supposed terrified the queen and the nation Ac cordingly they sent him many and very valuable presents as also ambassadors and that as he was besieging Ptolemais for Selene the queen the same that was also called Cleopatra ruled then over Syria who had persuaded the inhabitants to exclude Tigranes So the Jewish ambassadors interceded with him and entreated him that he would determine nothing that was severe about their queen or nation He commended them for the re spects they paid him at so great a distance and gave them good hopes of his favour But as soon as Ptolemais was taken news came to Tigranes that Lucullus in his pursuit of Mithridates could not light upon him who was fled into Tberia but was laying waste Armenia and besieging its cities Now when Tigranes knew this he returned home 5 After this when the queen was fallen into a dangerous distemper Aristobulus resolved to attempt the seizing of the government so he stole away secretly by night with only one of his servants and went to the fortresses wherein his friends that were such from the days of his father were settled for as he had been a great while displeased at his mother s conduct so he was now much more afraid lest upon her death their whole family should be under the power of the Pharisees for he saw the inability of his brother who was to succeed in the govern ment  nor was any one conscious of what he was doing but only his wife whom he left at Jerusalem with their children He first of all came to Agaba where was Galestes one of the potent men before mentioned and was received by him When it was day the queen perceived that Aristobulus was fled and for some time she supposed that his departure was not in order to make any innovation but when messengers came one after another with the news that he had secured the first place the second place and all the places for as soon as one had begun they all submitted to his disposal then it was that the queen and the nation were in the greatest disorder for they were aware that it would not be long ere Aristobulus would be able to settle himself firmly in the government What they were principally afraid of was this that he would inflict punishment upon them for the mad treatment his house had had from them So they resolved to take his wife and children into custody and keep them in the  fortress that was over the temple Now there was a mighty conflux of people that came to Aristobulus from  This fortress castle citadel or tower whither the wife and children of Aristo bulus were now sent and which overlooked the temple could be no other than what Hyrcanus I built Antiq B XVIII ch iv sect 3 vol III and Herod the Great rebuilt and called the Tower ofAntonia Antiq B XV ch xi sect 5 vol II Chap XVI ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 251 nil parts insomuch that he had a kind of royal attendants about him for in a little more than fifteen days he got twenty two strong places which gave him the opportunity of raising an ar my from Libanus and Trachonitis and the monarchs for men are easily led by the greater number and easily submit to them And besides this that by affording him their assistance when he could not expect it they as well as he should have the advan tages that would come by his being king because they had been the occasion of his gaining the kingdom Now the elders of the Jews and Hyrcanus with them went in unto the queen and desired That she would give them her sentiments about the present posture of affairs for that Aristobulus was in ef feet lord of almost all the kingdom by possessing of so many strong holds and that it was absurd for them to take any counsel by themselves how ill soever she were whilst she was alive and that the danger would be upon them in no long time But she  bid them do what they thought pro per to be done that they had many circumstances in their favour still remaining a nation in good heart an army and money in their several treasuries for that she had small con cern about public affairs now when the strength of her body already failed her 6 Now a little while after she had said this to them she died when she had reigned nine years and had in all lived seventy three A woman she was who showed no signs of the weakness of her sex for she was sagacious to the greatest degree in her ambition of governing and demonstrated by her doings at once that her mind was fit for action and that sometimes men them selves show the little understanding they have by the frequent mistakes they make in point of government for she always pre ferred the present to futurity and preferred the power of an im perious dominion above all things and in comparison of that had no regard to what was good or what was right However she brought the affairs of her house to such an unfortunate condition that she was the occasion of the taking away that authority from it and that in no long time afterward which she had obtained by a vast number of hazards and misfortunes and this out of a de sire of what does not belong to a woman and all by a compliance in her sentiments with those that bare ill will to their family and by leaving the administration destitute of a proper support of great men and indeed her management during her adminis tration while she was alive was such as filled the palace after her death with calamities and disturbance However although this had been her way of governing she preserved the nation in peace And this is the conclusion of the affairs of Alexandra VOL 41 II 33 252 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEVTS Book XIV BOOK XIV CONTAINING THE INTERVAL OF THIRTY TWO YEARS FROM THE DEATH OF QUEEN ALEXANDRA TO THE DEATH OF ANTIGONUS CHAP I The war between Aristobulus and Hyrcanus about the kingdom and how they made an agreement that Aristobulus should be king and Hyrcanus live a private life as also how Hyrcan us a little afterward was persuaded by Antipater to Jly to Aretas i O J Â 1 WE have related the affairs of Queen Alexandra and her death in the foregoing book and will now speak of what followed and was connected with those histories declaring before we proceed that we have nothing so much at heart as this they we may  omit no facts either through ignorance or laziness for we are upon the history and explication of such things as the greatest part are unacquainted withal because of their distance from our times and we aim to do it with a proper beauty of style so far as that is derived from proper words harmonically disposed and from such ornaments of speech also as may contribute to the pleasure of our readers that we may entertain the knowledge of what we write with some agreeable satisfaction and pleasure But the principal scope that authors ought to aim at above all the rest is to speak accurately and to speak truly for the satisfaction of those that are otherwise unacquainted with such transactions and obliged to believe what these writers inform them of 2 Hyrcanus then began his high priesthood on the third year of the hundred seventy seventh olympiad when Quintius Horten sius and Quintus Metellus who was called Metellus of Crete were consuls at Rome when presently Aristobulus began to make war against him and as it came to a battle with Hyrcan tis at Jericho many of the soldiers deserted him and went over to his brother upon which Hyrcanus fled into the citadel where Aristobulus wife and children were imprisoned by their mo ther as we have said already and attacked and overcame those  Reland takes notice here very justly how Joseplms declaration that it was his great concern not only to write an agreeable an accurate and a true history but also distinctly not to omit any thing of consequence either through ignorance or laziness implies that he could not consistently with that resolution omit the mention of so famous a person as Jesvs Christ Chap I ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 253 his adversaries that had fled thither and lay within the walls of the temple So when he had sent a message to his brother about agreeing the matters between them he laid aside his enmity to him on these conditions that Aristobulus should be king that he should live without intermeddling with public affairs and quietly enjoy the estate he had acquired When they had agreed upon these terms in the temple and had confirmed the agree ment with oaths and the giving one another their right hands and embracing one another in the sight of the whole multitude they departed the one Aristobulus to the palace and Hyrcan us as a private man to the former house of Aristobulus 3 But there was a certain friend of Hyrcanus an Idumean called Antipater who was very rich and in his nature an active and a seditious man who was at enmity with Aristobulus and had differences with him on account of his good will to Hyrcan us It is true that Nicolaus of Damascus says that Antipater was of the stock of the principal Jews who came out of Babylon into Judea but that assertion of his was to gratify Herod who was his son and who by certain revolutions of fortune came af terward to be king of the Jews whose history we shall give you in its proper place hereafter However this Antipater was at first called  Antipas and that was his father s name also oi whom they relate this that king Alexander and his wife made him general of all Idumea and that he made a league of friend ship with those Arabians and Gazites and Ascalonites that were of his own party and had by many and large presents made them his fast friends But now this younger Antipater was suspicious of the power of Aristobulus and was afraid of some mischief he might do him because of his hatred to him so he stirred up the most powerful of the Jews and talked against him to them privately and said that it was unjust to over look the conduct of Aristobulus who had gotten the government unrighteously and ejected his brother out of it who was the elder and ought to retain what belonged to him by preroga tive of his birth And the same speeches he perpetually made to Hyrcanus and told him that his own life would be in danger unless he guarded himself and got shut of Aristobu lus for he said that the friends of Aristobulus omitted no op portunity of advising him to kill him as being then and not be fore sure to retain his principality Hyrcanus gave no credit to these words of his as being of a gentle disposition and one that did not easily admit of calumnies against other men  That the famous Antipater s or Antipas father was also Antipater or 4ntipas which two may justly be esteemed one and the same name the former with a Greek or Gentile the latter with a Hebrew or Jewish termination Josephus here assures us though Eusebius indeed says it was Herod 254 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XIV This temper of his not disposing him to meddle with public affairs and want of spirit occasioned him to appear to specta tors to be degenerous and unmanly while Aristobulus was of a contrary temper an active man and one of a great and gener ous soul 4 Since therefore Antipater saw that Hyrcanus did not attend to what he said he never ceased day by day to charge feigned crimes upon Aristobulus and to calumniate him before him as if he had a mind to kill him and so by urging him perpetually he advised him and persuaded him to fly to Aretas the king of Arabia and promised that if he would comply with his ad vice he would also himself assist him and go with him When Hyrcanus heard this he said that it was for his advantage to fly away to Aretas Now Arabia is a country that borders upon Judea However Hyrcanus sent Antipater first to the king of Arabia in order to receive assurances from him that when he should come in the manner of a supplicant to him he would not deliver him up to his enemies So Antipater having received such assurances returned to Hyrcanus to Jerusalem A while afterward he took Hyrcanus and stole out of the city by night and went a great journey and came and brought him to the city called Petra where the palace of Aretas was and as he was a very familiar friend of that king s he persuaded him to bring buck Hyrcanus into Judea and his persuasion he continued every day without any intermission He also pro posed to make him presents on that account At length he pre vailed with Aretas in his suit Moreover Hyrcanus promised him that when he had been brought thither and had received his kingdom he would restore that country and those twelve cities which his father Alexander had taken from the Arabians which were these Medaba Naballo Libias Tharabasa Agala Athene Zoar Orone Marissa Rudda Lussa and Oruba CHAP II How Aretas and Hyrcanus made an expedition against Aristobu lus and besieged Jerusalem and houi Scaitrus the Roman ge neral raised the siege Concerning the death of Onias Â 1 A FTER these promises had been given to Aretas he made an expedition against Aristobulus with an army of fifty thousand horse and foot and beat him in the battle And when after that victory many went over to Hyrcanus as desert ers Aristobulus was left desolate and fled to Jerusalem upon which the king of Arabia took all his army and made an assault upon the temple and besieged Aristobulus therein the peo Chap II ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 255 pie still supporting Hyrcanus and assisting him in the siege while none but the priests continued with Aristobulus So Aretas united the forces of the Arabians and of the Jews together and pressed on the siege vigorously As this happened at the time when the feast of unleavened bread was celebrated which we call the passover the principal men among the Jews left the coun try and fled into Egypt Now there was one whose name was Onias a righteous man he was and beloved of God who in a certain drought had prayed to God to put an end to the intense heat and whose prayers God had heard and had sent them rain This man had hid himself because he saw that this sedition would last a great while However they brought him to the Jewish camp and desired that as by his prayers he had once put an end to the drought so he would in like manner make impre cations on Aristobulus and those of his faction And when upon his refusal and the excuses that he made he was still by the multitude compelled to speak he stood up in the midst of them and said O God the king of the whole world since those that stand now with me are thy people and those that are besieged are also thy priests I beseech thee that thou wilt neither hearken to the prayers of those against these nor bring to effect what these pray against those Whereupon such wick ed Jews as stood about him as soon as he had made this prayer stoned him to death 2 But God punished them immediately for this their barba rity and took vengeance of them for the murder of Onias in the manner following While the priests and Aristobulus were besieged it happened that the feast called the Passover was come at which it is our custom to offer a great number of sacrifices to God but those that were with Aristobulus wanted sacrifices and desired that their countrymen without would furnish them with such sacrifices and assured them they should have as much money for them as they should desire and when they required them to pay a thousand drachmae for each head of cattle Aristo bulus and the priests willingly undertook to pay for them ac cordingly and those within let down the money over the walls and gave it them But when the others had received it they did not deliver the sacrifices but arrived at that height of wick edness as to break the assurances they had given and to be guilty of impiety towards God by not furnishing those that wanted them with sacrifices And when the priests found they had been cheated and that the agreements they had made were violated they prayed to God that he would avenge them on their coun trymen Nor did he delay that their punishment but sent a strong and vehement storm of wind that destroyed the fruits of the whole country till a modius of wheat was then bought for eleven drachmas 256 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XIV 3 In the meantime Pompey sent Scaurus into Syria while he was himself in Armenia and making war with Tigranes But when Scaurus was come to Damascus and found that Lol lius and Metellus had newly taken the city he came himself hastily into Judea And when he was come thither ambassa dors came to him both from Aristobulus and Hyrcanus and both desired he would assist them And when both of them promised to give him money Aristobulus four hundred talents and Hyrcanus no less he accepted of Aristobulus promise for he was rich and had a great soul and desired to obtain nothing but what was moderate whereas the other was poor and te nacious and made incredible promises in hopes of greater ad vantages for it was not the same thing to take a city that was exceeding strong and powerful as it was to eject out of the country some fugitives with a greater number of Nabateans who were no very warlike people He therefore made an agree ment with Aristobulus for the reasons before mentioned and took his money and raised the siege and ordered Aretas to depart or else he should be declared an enemy to the Romans So Scaurus returned to Damascus again and Aristobulus with a great army made war with Aretas and Hyrcanus and fought them at a place called Pajnjron and beat them in the battle and slew about six thousand of the enemy with whom fell Phalion also the brother of Antipater CHAP III How Aristobulus and Hyrcanus came to Pompey in order to ar gue isoho ought to have the kingdom and how upon the flight of Aristobulus to the fortress Alexandrium Pompey led his army against him and ordered him to deliver up the fortresses whereof he was possessed 4 1 A LITTLE afterward Pompey came to Damascus and marched over Celesyria at which time their came ambassa dors to him from all Syria and Egypt and out of Judea also for Aristobulus had sent him a great present which was a  golden vine of the value of five hundred talents Now  Tliis golden vine or garden seen by Strabo at Rome lias its inscription here as if it were the gift of Alexander tlie father of Aristobulus and not of Aristobulus himself to whom yet Josephus ascribes it and in order to prove the truth of that part of his history introduces this testimony of Strabo s so that the ordinary copies seem to be here either erroneous or defective and the original reading seems to have been either jtrislobulvs instead of Aiexander with one Greek copy or else jlristnbu Itis the son of Alexander with the Latin copies which last seems to me the most pro bableâ For as to Archbishop Usher s conjectures that Alexander made it and de diratud it to Cod in the temple and that thence Aristolmlus took it and sent it to Chap III ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 257 Strabo of Cappadocia mentions this present in these words There came also an embassage out of Eygpt and a crown of the value of four thousand pieces of gold and out of Judea there came another whether you call it a vine or a garden They called the thing TERPULE The delight However we ourselves saw that present reposited at Rome in the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus with this inscription The gift of Alex ander the king of the Jews It was valued at five hundred talents and the report is that Aristobulus the governor of the Jews sent it 2 In a little time afterward came ambassadors again to him Antipater from Hyrcanus and Nicodemus from Aristobulus which last also accused such as had taken bribes first Gabinius and then Scaurus the one three hundred talents and the other four hundred by which procedure he made these two his ene mies besides those he had before And when Pompey had or dered those that had controversies one with another to come to him in the beginning of the spring he brought his army out of their winter quarters and marched into the country of Damas cus and as he went along he demolished the citadel that was at Apamia which Antiochus Cyzicenus had built and took cognizance of the country of Ptolemy Menneus a wicked man and not less so than Dionysius of Tripoli who had been be headed who was also his relation by marriage yet did he buy off the punishment of his crimes for a thousand talents witli which money Pompey paid the soldiers their wages He also conquered the place called Lysias of which Silas a Jew was tyrant And when he had passed over the cities of Helio polis and Chalcis and got over the mountain which is on the limit of Celesyria he came from Pella to Damascus and there it was that he heard the causes of the Jews and of their governors Hyrcanus and Aristobulus who were at difference one with another as also of the nation against them both which did not desire to be under kingly government because the form of government they received from their forefathers was that of subjection to the priests of that God whom they worshipped and they complained that though these two were the posterity of priests yet did they seek to change the government of their nation to another form in order to enslave them Hyrcanus complained that although he were the elder brother he was deprived of the prerogative of his birth by Pompey they are both very improbable and no way agreeable to Josephus who would hardly have avoided the recording both ihese uncommon points of history had he known any of them nor would either the Jewish naiion or even PompeJ himself then hare relished such a flagrant instance of sacrilege 2SS ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XIV Aristobulus and that he hath but a small part of the country under him Aristobulus having taken away the rest from him by force He also accused him that the incursions which had been made into their neighbours countries and the piracies that had been at sea were owing to him and that the nation would not have revolted unless Aristobulus had been a man given to vio lence and disorder and there were no fewer than a thousand Jews of the best esteem among them who confirmed this accu sation which confirmation was procured by Antipater But Aristobulus alleged against him that it was Hyrcanus own temper which was inactive and on that account contemptible which caused him to be deprived of the government and that for himself he was necessitated to take it upon him for fear lest it should be transferred to others And that as to his title of king it was no other than what his father had taken before him He also called for witnesses of what he said some per sons who were both young and insolent whose purple garments fine heads of hair and other ornaments were detested by the court and which they appeared in not as though they were to plead their cause in a court of justice but as if they were marching in a pompous procession 3 When Pompey had heard the causes of these two and had condemned Aristobulus for his violent procedure he then spake civilly to them and sent them away and told them that when he came again into their country he would settle all their affairs after he had first taken a view of the affairs of the Na bateans In the mean time he ordered them to be quiet and treated Aristobulus civilly lest he should make the nation re volt and hinder his return which yet Aristobulus did for without expecting any further determination which Pompey had promised them he went to the city Delius and thence marched into Judea 4 At this behaviour Pompey was angry and taking with him that army which he was leading against the Nabateans and the auxiliaries that came from Damascus and the other parts of Syria with the other Roman legions which he had with him he made an expedition against Aristobulus but as he passed by Pella and Scythopolis he came to Coreae which is the first en trance into Judea when one passes over the midland countries where he came to a most beautiful fortress that was built on the top of a mountain called Alexandrium whither Aristobulus had fled and thence Pompey sent his commands to him that he should come to him Accordingly at the persuasions of many that he would not make war with the Romans he came clown and when he had disputed with lu s brother about the right to the government he went up again to the citadel as Chap IV ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 259 Pompey gave him leave to do and this he did two or three times as flattering himself with the hopes of having the king dom granted him so that he still pretended he would obey Pom pey in whatsoever he commanded although at the same time he retired to his fortress that he might not depress himself too Ipw and that he might be prepared for a war in case it should prove as he feared that Pompey should transfer the government to Hyr canus But when Pompey enjoined Aristobulus to deliver up the fortresses he held and to send an injunction to their govern ors under his own hand for that purpose for they had been forbidden to deliver them up upon any other commands he sub mitted indeed to do so but still he retired in displeasure to Je rusalem and made preparation for war A little after this certain persons came out of Pontus and informed Pompey as he was on the way and conducting his army against Aristobu lus that Mithridates was dead and was slain by his son Phar naces CHAP IV Hffso Pompey when the citizens of Jerusalem shift the gates against him besieged the city and took it by force as also isihat other things he did in Judea go Â 1 jNow when Pompey had pitched his

marched in the morning to Jerusalem Hereupon Aristo bulus repented of what he was doing and came to Pompey and promised to give him money and received him into Je rusalem and desired that he would leave off the war and do what he pleased peaceably So Pompey upon his entreaty for gave him and sent Gabinius and soldiers with him to receive the money and the city Yet was no part of this performed but  These expres testimonies of Josephus here and Antiq B VIII chap vi sect 6 vol I and B XV chap iv sect 2 vol II that the only balsam gardens and the best palm trees were at least in his days near Jericho and Engaddi about the north part of the dead sea whereabout also Alexander the Great saw the balsam drop show the mistake of those that understand Eusebius and Jerom as if one of those gardens were at the sou h part of that sea at Zoar or Segor whereas they must either mean another Zoar or Segor which was between Jericho and Engaddi agreeably to Josephus which yet they do not appear to do or else they directly contradict Jose phus and were therein greatly mistaken unless that balsam and the best palm trees grew much more southward in Judea in the days of Eusebius and Jerom than they did in the days of Josephus VOL II K K 23 260 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XIIL Gabinius came back being both excluded out of the city and receiving none of the money promised because Aristobulus soldiers would not permit the agreements to be executed At this Pompey was very angry and put Aristobulus into prison and came himself to the city which was strong on every side excepting the north which was not so well fortified for there was  a broad and deep ditch that encompassed the city and in cluded within the temple which was itself encompassed about with a very strong stone wall 2 Now there was a sedition of the men that were within the city who did not agree what was to be done in their present circumstances while some thought it best to deliver up the city to Pompey but Aristobulus party exhorted them to shut the gates because he was kept in prison Now these prevented the others and seized upon the temple and cut oft the bridge which reached from it to the city and prepared themselves to abide a siege but the others admitted Pompey s army in and delivered up both the city and the king s palace to him So Pompey sent his lieutenant Piso with an army and placed garrisons both in the city and in the palace to secure them and fortified the houses that joined to the temple and all those which were more distant and without it And in the first place he offered terms of accommodation to those within but when they would not comply with what was desired he encompassed all the places thereabout with a wall wherein Hyrcanus did gladly assist him on all occasions but Pompey pitched his camp within the wall on the north part of the temple where it was most practicable but even on that side there were great towers and a ditch had been dug and a deep valley begirt it round about for on the parts towards the city were precipices and the bridge on which Pompey had gotten in was broken down however a bank was raised day by day with a great deal of labour while the Ro mans cut down materials for it from the places round about And when this bank was sufficiently raised and the ditch filled up though but poorly by reason of its immense depth he brought his mechanical engines and battering rams from Tyre and placing them on the bank he battered the temple with the stones that were thrown against it And had it not been our practice from the days of our forefathers to rest on the se  The particular depth and breadth of this ditch whence the stones for the wall about the temple were probably taken are omitted in our copies of Josephus but set down by Strabo B XVI p 763 from whom we learn that this ditch was CO feet deep and 250 feet broad However its depth is in the first section said by Jose phus to be immense which exactly agrees to Strabo s description and which number in Strabo are a strong confirmation of the truth of Josephus description also Chap IV ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 261 venth day this bank could never have been perfected by rea son of the opposition the Jews would have made for though our laws give us leave then to defend ourselves against those that began to fight with us and assault us yet it does not permit us to meddle with our enemies while they do any thing  else 3 Which thing when the Romans understood on those days which we call Sabbaths they threw nothing at the Jews nor came to any pitched battle with them but raised up their earthen banks and brought their engines into such forwardness that they might do execution the following days And any one may hence learn how very great piety we exercise towards God and the observance of his laws since the priests were not at all hindered from their sacred ministrations by their fear during this siege but did still twice a day in the morning and about the ninth hour offer their sacrifices on the altar nor did they omit those sacrifices if any melancholy accident happened by the stones that were thrown among them for although the city was taken on  the third month on the day of the fast upon the hundred seventy ninth olympiad when Caius Antonius and Marcus Tullius Cicero were consuls and the enemy then fell upon them and cut the throats of those that were in the tem ple yet could not those that offered the sacrifice be compelled to run away neither by the fear they were in of their own lives nor by the number that were already slain as thinking it bet ter to suffer whatever came upon them at their very altars than to omit any thing that their laws required of them And that this is not a mere brag or an encomium to manifest a de gree of our piety that was false but is the real truth I appeal to those that have written of the acts of Pompey and among them to Strabo and Nicolaus of Damascus 3 and besides these two Titus Livius the

the enemy poured in apace and Cornelius Faustus the son of Sylla with his soldiers first of all ascended the wall and next to him Furius the centurion with those that followed on the other part while Fabius who was also a centurion ascended it in the middle with a great body of men after him But now all was full of slaughter some of the Jews being slain by the Romans and some by one ano ther nay some there were who threw themselves down the pre cipices or put fire to their houses and burnt them as not able to bear the miseries they were under Of the Jews there fell twelve thousand but of the Romans very few Absalom who was at once both uncle and father in law to Aristobulus wus taken captive And no small enormities were committed about the temple itself which in former ages had been inaccessible and seen by none for Pompey went into it and not a few of those that were with him also and saw all that which it was unlawful for any other men to see but only for the high priests There were in that temple the golden table the holy candlestick and the pouring vessels and a great quantity of spices and be sides these there were among the treasures two thousand ta lents of sacred money Yet  did Pompey touch nothing of all this on account of his regard to religion and in this point also he acted in a manner that was worthy of his virtue The next day he gave order to those that had the charge of the temple to cleanse it and to bring what offerings the law required to God and restored the high priesthood to Hyrcanus both because he had been useful to him in other respects and because he hin dered the Jews in the country from giving Aristobulus any as sistance in his war against him He also cut off those that had been the authors of that war and bestowed proper rewards on Faustus and those others that mounted the wall with such alac rity and he made Jerusalem tributary to the Romans and took away those cities of Coelesyria which the inhabitants of Ju dea had subdued and put them under the government of the Ro man president and confined the whole nation which had elevat ed itself so high before within its own bounds Moreover he f rebuilt Gadara which had been demolished a little before to gratify Demetrius of Gadara who was his freed man and re stored the rest of the cities Hippos and Scy thopolis and Pella and Dios and Samaria as also Marissa and Ashdod and Jam  This is fully confirmed by the testimony of Cicero who says in his oration for Flaccus That  Cneius Pompeius when he was conqueror and had taken Jeru salem did not touch any thing belonging

glorious manner and adorned with havens and temples and changed its name to Ce sarea All these Pompey left in a state of freedom and joined them to the province of Syria 5 Now the occasions of this misery which came upon Jeru salem were Hyrcanus and Aristobulus by raising a sedition one against the other for now we lost our liberty and became subject to the Romans and were deprived of that country which we had gained by our arms from the Syrians and were compel led to restore it to the Syrians Moreover the Romans ex acted of us in a little time above ten thousand talents And the royal authority which was a dignity formerly bestowed on those that were high priests by the right of their family be came the property of private men But of these matters we shall treat in their proper places Now Pompey committed Cce lesyria as far as the river Euphrates and Egypt to Scaurus with two Roman legions and then went away to Cilicia r nd made haste to Rome He also carried bound along with him Aristobulus and his children for he had two daughters and as many sons the one of which ran away but the younger An tigonus was carried to Rome together with h5s sisters CHAP V How Scaurus made a league of mutual assistance ivith Aretas And what Gabinius did in Judea after he had conquered Alexander the son of Aristobulus Â 1 OCAURUS made now an expedition against Petrea in Arabia and set on fire all the places round about it because of the great difficulty of access to it And as his army was pinch ed by famine Antipater furnished him with corn out of Judea and with whatever else he wanted and this at the command of Hyrcanus And when he was sent to Aretas as an ambassador by Scaurus because he had lived with him formerly he per suaded Aretas to give Scaurus a sum of money to prevent the burning of his country and undertook to be his surety for three hundred talents So Scaurus upon these terms ceased to make war any longer which was done as much at Scaurus desire as at the desire of Aretas 2 Some time after this when Alexander the son of Aristo bulus made an incursion into Judea Gabinius came from Rome to Syria as commander of the Roman forces He did many 264 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XIV considerable actions and particularly made war with Alexander since Hyrcanus was not yet able to oppose his power but was already attempting to build the walls of Jerusalem which Pompey had overthrown although the Romans which were there restrained him from that his design However Alexan der went over all the country round about and armed many of the Jews and suddenly got together ten thousand armed footmen and fifteen hundred horsemen and fortified Alexan drium a fortress near to Corae and Macherus near the moun tains of Arabia Gabinius therefore came upon him having sent Marcus Antonius with other commanders before These armed such Romans as followed them and together with them such Jews as were subject to them whose leaders were Pitho laus and Malichus and they took with them also their friends that were with Antipater and met Alexander while Gabinius himself followed with his legion Hereupon Alexander retired to Jerusalem where they fell upon one another and it came to a pitched battle in which the Romans slew of their enemies about three thousand and took a like number alive 3 At which time Gabinius came to Alexandrium and in vited those that were in it to deliver it up on certain conditions and promised that then their former offences should be forgiven But as a great number of the enemy had pitched their camp before the fortress whom the Romans attacked Marcus An tonius fought bravely and slew a great number and seemed to come off with the greatest honour So Gabinius left part of his army there in order to take the place and he himself went into other parts of Judea and gave order to rebuild all the cities that he met with that had been demolished at which time were rebuilt Samaria Ashdod Scythopolis Anthedon Raphia and Dora Marissa also and Gaza and not a few others be sides And as the men acted according to Gabinus com mand it came to pass that at this time these cities were secure ly inhabited which had been desolate for a long time 4 When Gabinius had done thus in the country he return ed to Alexandrium  and when he urged on the siege of the place Alexander sent an embassage to him desiring that he would par don his former offences  he also delivered up the fortresses Hyr cania and Macherus and at last Alexandrium itself which for tresses Gabinius demolished But when Alexander s mother who was of the side of the Romans as having her husband and other children at Rome came to him he granted her whatsoever she asked and when he had settled matters with her he brought Hyrcanus to Jerusalem and committed the care of the temple to him And when he had ordained five councils he distributed the same nation into the same number of parts So these coun Chap VI ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 265 cils governed the people the first was at Jerusalem the second at Gadara the third at Amathus the fourth at Jericho and the fifth in Sepphoris in Galilee So the Jews were now freed from monarchic authority and were governed by an  aristo cracy CHAP VL How Gabinius caught Aristobulus after he had Jled from Rome and sent him back to Borne again and how the same Gabinius as he returned out of Egypt overcame Alexander and the Na bateans in battle 5 1 N ow Aristobulus ran away from Rome to Judea and set about the rebuilding of Alexandrium which had been newly demolished Hereupon Gabinius sent soldiers against him and for their commanders Sisenna and Antonius and fc ervil ius in order to hinder him from getting possession of the country and to take him again And indeed many of the Jews ran to Aristobulus on account of his former glory as also be cause they should be glad of an innovation Now there was one Pitholaus a lieutenant at Jerusalem who deserted to him with a thousand men although a great number of those that came to him were unarmed  and when Aristobulus had resolved to go to Macherus he dismissed those people because they were un armed for they could not be useful to him in what actions they were going about but he took with him eight thousand that were armed and marched on and as the Romans fell upon them severely the Jews fought valiantly but were beaten in the bat tle and when they had fought with alacrity but were over borne by the enemy they were put to flight of whom were slain about five thousand and the rest being dispersed tried as well as they were able to save themselves However Aristo bulus had with him still above a thousand and with them he fled to Macherus and fortified the place and though he had had ill success he still had good hope of his affairs but when he had struggled against the siege for two days time and had received many wounds he was brought as a captive to Gabinius with his son Antigonius who also fled with him from Rome And this was the fortune of Aristobulus who was sent back again to Rome and was there retained in bonds having been both king and high priest for three years and six months and was  Dean Prideaux well observes  That notwithstanding the clamour against Gabiuius at Rome Josephus gives him a laudable character as if he had ac quitted himself with honour in the charge committed to him in Judea Sec at the year 55 266 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XIV mdeed an eminent person and one of a great soul However the senate let his children go upon Gabinius writing to them that he had promised their mother so much when she delivered up the fortresses to him and accordingly they then returned into Judea 2 Now when Gabinius was making an expedition against the Parthians and had already passed over Euphrates he changed his mind and resolved to return into Egypt in order to  re store Ptolemy to his kingdom This hath also been related else where However Antipater supplied his army which he sent against Archelans with corn and weapons and money He also made those Jews who were above Felusium his friends and confederates and had been the guardians of the passes that led into Egypt But when he came back out of Egypt he found Syria in disorder with seditions and troubles for Alexander the son of Aristobulus having seized on the government a second time by force made many of the Jews revolt to him and so he marched over the country with a great army and slew all the Romans he could light upon and proceeded to besiege the mountain called Gerrizzim whither they had retreated 3 But when Gabinius found Syria in such a state he sent An tipater who was a prudent man to those that were seditious to try whether he could cure them of their madness and per suade them to return to a better mind and when he came to them he brought many of them to a sound mind and induced them to do what they ought to do but he could not restrain Alexander for he had an army of thirty thousand Jews and met Gabinius and joining battle with him was beaten and lost ten thousand of his men about mount Tabor 4 So Gabinius settled the affairs which belonged to the city Jerusalem as was agreeable to Antipater s inclination and went against the Nabateans and overcame them in battle He also sent away in a friendly manner Mithridates and Orsanes who were Parthian deserters and came to himr though the report went abroad that they had run away from him And when Ga binius had performed great and glorious actions in his manage ment of the affairs of war he returned to Rome and delivered the government to Crassus Now Nicolaus of Damascus and Strabo of Cappadocia both describe the expeditions of Pompey and Gabinius against the Jews while neither of them say any thing new which is not in the other Â Tliis history is best illustrated by Dr Hudson out of Livy who says That A Gabinius the proconsul restored Ptolemy to his kingdom of Egypt and ejected Archelaus whom they had set up for king c See Prid at the years 64 and 65 Chap VII ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEVVS 267 CHAP VII How Crassus came into Judea and pillaged the temple and then marched against the Parthians and perished with his army Also hffw Cassius obtained Syria  and put a stop to the Par thians and then went up to Judea Â 1 IS ow Crassus as he was going upon his expedition against the Parthians came into Judea and carried off the money that was in the temple which Pompey had left being two thousand talents and was disposed to spoil it of all the gold belonging to it which was eight thousand talents He also took a beam which was made of solid beaten gold of the weight of three hundred minae each of which weighed two pounds and an half It was the priest who was guardian of the sacred trea sures and whose name was Elcazar that gave him this beam not out of a wicked design for he was a good and a righteous man but being intrusted with the custody of the veils belonging to the temple which were of admirable beauty and of very costly workmanship and hung down from this beam when he saw that Crassus was busy in gathering money and was in fear for the entire ornaments of the temple he gave him this beam of gold as a ransom for the whole but this not till he had given his oath that he would remove nothing else out of the temple but be satisfied with this only which he should give him being worth many ten thousand shekels Now this beam was con tained in a wooden beam that was hollow but was known to no others but Eleazar alone knew it yet did Crassus take away this beam upon the condition of touching nothing else that be longed to the temple and then brake his oath and carried away all the gold that was in the temple 2 And let no one wonder that there was so much wealth in our temple since all the Jews throughout the habitable earth and those that worshipped God nay even those of Asia and Eu rope sent their contributions to it and this from very ancient times Nor is the largeness of these sums without its attesta tion nor is that greatness owing to our vanity as raising it without ground to so great a height But there are many wit nesses to it and particularly Strabo of Cappadocia who says thus Mithridates sent to Cos and took the money which queen Cleopatra had deposited there as also eight hundred talents belonging to the Jews Now we have no public money but only what appertains to God and it is evident that the Asian Jews removed this money out of fear of Mithridates for it is not probable that those of Judea who had a strong city and VOL JI it 23 368 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XIV temple should send their money to Cos nor is it likely that the Jews who are inhabitants of Alexandria should do so nei ther since they were in no fear of Mithridates And Strabo himself bears witness to the same thing in another place that at the same time that Sylla passed over into Greece in order to fight against Mithridates he sent Lucullus to put an end to a sedition that our nation of whom the habitable earth is full had raised in Cyrene where he speaks thus There were four classes of men among those of Cyrene that of citizens that of hus bandmen the third of strangers and the fourth of Jews Now these Jews are already gotten into all cities and it is hard to find a place in the habitable earth that hath not admitted this tribe of men and is not possessed by it And it hath come to pass that Egypt and Cyrene as having the same governors and a great number of other nations imitate their way of living and maintain great bodies of these Jews in a peculiar manner and grow up to greater prosperity with them and make use of the same laws with that nation also Accord ingly the Jews have places assigned them in Egypt wherein they inhabit besides what is peculiarly allotted to this nation at Alexandria which is a large part of that city There is also an ethnarch allowed them who governs the nation and distributes justice to them and takes care of their contracts and of the laws to them belonging as if he were the ruler of a free republic In Egypt therefore this nation is power ful because the Jews were originally Egyptians and because the land wherein they inhabit since they went thence is near to Egypt They also removed into Cyrene because that this land adjoined to the government of Egypt as well as does Judea or rather was formerly under the same government And this is what Strabo says 3 So when Crassus had settled all things as he himself pleas ed he marched into Parthia where both he himself and all his army perished as hath been related elsewhere But Cassius as he fled from Rome to Syria took possession of it and was an impediment to the Parthians who by reason of their victory over Crassus made incursions upon it And as he came back to Tyre he went up into Judea also and fell upon Tarichae and presently took it and carried about thirty thousand Jews cap tives and slew Pitholaus who succeeded Aristobulus in his se ditious practices and that by the persuasion of Antipater who proved to have great interest in him and was at that time in great repute with the Idumeans also Out of which nation he married a wife who was the daughter of one of their eminent men and her name was  Cypros by whom he had four sons  r Hudson observes that the name of this wife of Antipater s in Josephus was Cyprus as an Hebrew termination but not Cj pris the Greek name for Venu as some critics were ready to corrtct it Chap VIII ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 269 Phasael and Herod who was afterwards made king and Jo seph and Pheroras and a daughter named Salome This An tipater cultivated also a friendship and mutual kindness with other potentates but especially with the king of Arabia to whom he committed his children while he fought against Aris tobulus So Cassius removed his camp and marched to Eu phrates to meet those that were coming to attack him as hath been related by others 4 But some time afterward Caesar when he had taken Rome and after Pompey and the senate were fled beyond the Ionian sea freed Aristobulus from his bonds and resolved to send him into Syria and delivered two legions to him that he might see matters right as being a potent man in that country But Aristobulus had no enjoyment of what he hoped for from the power that was given him by Caesar for those of Pompey s party prevented it and destroyed him by poison and those of Ce sar s party buried him His dead body also lay for a good while embalmed in honey till Antony afterward sent it to Judea and caused him to be buried in the royal sepulchre But Scipio upon Pompey s sending to him to slay Alexander the son of Aristobulus because the young man was accused of what offen ces he had been guilty of at first against the Romans cut off his head and thus did he die at Antioch But Ptolemy the son of Menneus who was the ruler of Chalcis under mount Liba nus took his brethren to him and sent his son Philippion to Askelon to Aristobulus wife and desired her to send back with him her son Antigonus and her daughters The one of which whose name was Alexandra Philippion fell in love with and married her though afterward his father Ptolemy slew him and married Alexandra and continued to take care of her brethren CHAP VIII The Jems become confederates with Caesar when he fought against Egypt The glorious actions of Antipater and his friendship with Ccesar The honours which the Jews received from the Romans and Athenians 5 1 Now after Pompey was dead and after that victory Caesar had gained over him Antipater who managed the Jew ish affairs became very useful to Caesar when he made war against Egypt and that by the order of Hyrcanus For when Mithridates of Pergamus was bringing his auxiliaries and was not able to continue his march through Pelusium but obliged to stay at Askelon Antipater came to him conducting three thou 270 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XIV sand of the Jews armed men He had also taken care the princi pal men of the Arabians should come to his assistance and on his account it was that all the Syrians assisted him also as not willing to appear behind hand in their alacrity for Caesar viz Jamblicus the ruler and Ptolemy his son and Thoiomy the son of Sohemus who dwelt at mount Libanus and almost all the cities So Mithridates marched out of Syria and came to Pe lusium and when its inhabitants would not admit him he be sieged the city Now Antipater signalized himself here and was the first who plucked down a part of the wall and so opened a way to the rest whereby they might enter the city and by this means Pelusium was taken but it happened that the Egyp tian Jews who dwelt in the country called Onion would not let Antipater and Mithridates with their soldiers pass to Caesar but Antipater persuaded them to come over to their party because he was of the same people with them and that chiefly by show ing them the epistles of Hyrcanus the high priest wherein he exhorted them to cultivate friendship with Caesar and to sup ply his army with money and all sorts of provisions which they wanted and accordingly when they saw Antipater and the high priest of the same sentiments they did as they were desired And when the Jews about Memphis heard that these Jews were come over to Caesar they also invited Mithridates to come to them so he came and received them also into his army 2 And when Mithridates had gone over all Delta as the place is called he came to a pitched battle with the enemy near the place called the Jewish camp Now Mithridates had the right wing and Antipater the left and when it came to a fight that wing where Mithridates was gave way and was likely to suffer extremely unless Antipater had come running to him with his own soldiers along the shore when he had already beaten the enemy that opposed him so he delivered Mithri dates and put those Egyptians who had been too hard for him to flight He also took their camp and continued in the pursuit of them He also recalled Mithridates who had been worsted and was retired a great way off of whose soldiers eight hundred fell but of Antipater s fifty So Mithridates sent an account of this battle to Caesar and openly declared that Antipater was the author of his victory and of his own preservation insomuch that Caesar commended Antipater then and made use of him all the rest of that war in the most hazardous undertakings he hap pened also to be wounded in one of those engagements 3 However when Caesar after some time had finished that war and was sailed away for Syria he honoured Antipater greatly and confirmed Hyrcanus in the high priesthood and bestowed on Antipater the privilege of a citizen of Rome and Chap VIII ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 2 t freedom from taxes every where and it is reported by many that Hyrcanus went along with Antipater in this expedition and came himself into Egypt And Strabo of Capadocia bears witness to this when he says thus in the name of Asinius After Mithridates had invaded Egypt and with him Hyrcan  us the high priest of the Jews Nay the same Strabo says thus again in another place in the name of Hypsicrates that Mithridates at first went out alone but that Antipater who had the care of the Jewish affairs was called by him to As kelon and that he had gotten ready three thousand soldiers to go along with him and encouraged other governors of the country to go along with him also and that Hyrcanus the high priest was also present in this expedition This is what Strabo says 4 But Antigonus the son of Aristobulus came at this time to Caesar and  lamented his father s fate and complained that it was by Antipater s means that Aristobulus was taken off by poison and his brother was beheaded by Scipio and de sired that he would take pity of him who had been ejected out of that principality which was due to him He also accused Hyrcanus and Antipater as governing the nation by violence and offering injuries to him Antipater was pre sent and made his defence as to the accusations that were laid against him He demonstrated that  Antigonus and his party were given to innovation and were seditious persons He also put Cuesar in mind what difficult services he had undergone when he assisted him in his wars and discoursed about what he was a witness of himself He added that Aristobulus was justly carried away to Rome as one that was an enemy to the Romans and could never be brought to be a friend to them and that his brother had no more than he deserved from Sci pio as being seized in committing robberies and that this punishment was not inflicted on him in a way of violence or injustice by him that did it 5 When Antipater had made this speech Caesar appointed Hyrcanus to be high priest and gave Antipater what princi dality he himself should choose leaving the determination to himself So he made him procurator of Judea He also gave Hyrcanus leave to raise up the walls of his own city upon his asking that favour of him for they had been demolished by Pom pey And this grant he sent to the consuls to Rome to be en graven in the capitol The  decree of the senate was this that  Take Dr Hudson s note upon this place which I suppose to be

the Romans which was in being before They also brought a shield of gold as a mark of confederacy valued at fifty thousand pieces of gold and desired that letters might be given them directed both to the free cities and to the kings that their country and their havens might be at peace and that no one among them might receive any injury It there fore pleased the senate to make a league of friendship and good will with them and to bestow on them whatsoever they stood in need of and to accept of the shield which was brought by them This was done in the ninth year of Hyrcanus the high priest and ethnarch in the month Panemus Hyrcan us also received honours from the people of Athens as having been useful to them on many occasions And when they wrote to him they sent him this decree as it here follows Under the Prutaneia and priesthood of Dionysius the son of Escu lapius on the fifth day of the latter part of the month Pane mus this decree of the Athenians was given to their com manders when Agathocles was archon and Eucles the son of Menander of Alimusia was the scribe In the month Mu nychion on the eleventh day of the Prutaneia a council of the presidents was held in the

Athenians come to him either as ambassa dors or on any occasion of their own he receives them in an  gave order for one thing and his amanuensis performed another by transposing decrees that concerned the Hyrcani and as deluded by the sameness of their names for that belongs to the Jirst high priest of this name John Hyrcanus which Josephus here ascribes to one that lived later Hrycanus the son of

kindly and repay them a suitable reward and he may be induced to proceed in his affection towards us by the honours we have already paid him That ambassadors be also chosen out of all the Athenians who shall carry this decree to him and desire him to accept of the honours we do him and to endeavour always to be doing some good to our city And this shall suffice us to have spoken as to the honours that were paid by the Ro mans and the people of Athens to Hyrcanus CHAP IX How Antipater committed the care of Galilee to Herod and that of Jerusalem to Phasaelus as also how Herod upon the Jews envy at Antipater was accused before Hyrcanus Â 1 Now when Caesar had settled the affairs of Syria he sailed away And as soon as Antipater had conducted Caesar out of Syria he returned to Judea He then immediately raised up the wall which had been thrown down by Pompey and by coming thither he pacified that tumult which had been in the country and this by both threatening and advising them to be quiet For that If they would be of Hyrcanus side they would live happily and lead their lives without disturbance in the enjoyment of their own possessions but if they were addicted to the hopes of what might come by in novation and aimed to get wealth thereby they should have him a severe master instead of a gentle governor and Hyr canus a tyrant instead of a king and the Romans together with Caesar their bitter enemies instead of rulers for that they would never bear him to be set aside whom they had apÂ ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XIV pointed to govern And when Antipater had said this to them he himself settled the affairs of this country 2 And seeing that Hyrcanus was of a slow and slothful tem per he made Phasaelus his eldest son governor of Jerusalem and of the places that were about it but committed Galilee to Herod his next son who was then a very young man for he was but  fifteen years of age But that youth of his was no impediment to him but as he was a youth of great mind he presently met with an opportunity of signalizing his courage for finding that there was one Hezekias a captain of a band of robbers who overran the neighbouring parts of Syria with a great troop of them he seized him and slew him as well as a great number of the other robbers that were with him for which action he was greatly beloved by the Syrians for when they were very desirous to have their country freed from this nest of robbers he purged it of them So they sung songs in his commendation in their villages and cities as having pro cured them peace and the secure enjoyment of their possessions and on this account it was that he became known to Sextus Cae sar who was a relation of the great Caesar s and was now pre sident of Syria Now Phasaelus Herod s brother was moved with emulation at his actions and envied the fame he had there by gotten and became ambilious not to be behind hand with him in deserving it So he made the inhabitants of Jerusalem bear him the greatest good will while he held the city himself but did neither manage its affairs improperly nor abuse his autho rity therein This conduct procured from the nation to Anti pater such respect as is due to kings and such honours as he might partake of if he were an absolute lord of the country Yet did not this splendour of his as frequently happens in the least diminish in him that kindness and fidelity which he owed to Hyrcanus 3 But now the principal men among the Jews when they saw Antipater and his sons to grow so much in the good will the nation bare to them and in the revenues which they received out of Judea and out of Hyrcanus own wealth they became ill disposed to him for indeed Antipater had contracted a friend ship with the Roman emperors and when he had prevailed with Hyrcanus to send them money he took it to himself and  Those who will carefully observe the several occasional numbers and chronolo gical characters in the life and death of this Herod and of his childien hereafter noted will ste that twenty Jive years and not fifteen must for certain have been here Josepbus own number for the age of Herod when he was made governor of Galilee See chap xxiii sect 5 and chap xxiv sect 7 and particularly Antiq B XVII chap viii sect 1 vol III Â herÂ about 44 years afterwards Herod dies an old man at about 70 Chap X ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 275 purloined the present intended and sent it as if it were his own and not Hyrcanus gift to them Hyrcanus heard of this his management but took no care about it nay he rather was very glad of it But the chief men of the Jews were therefore in fear because they saw that Herod was a violent and bold man and very desirous of acting tyrannically so they came to Hyrcanus and now accused Antipater openly and said to him How long wilt thou be quiet under such actions as are now done Or doest thou not see that Antipater and his sons have already seized upon the government And that it is only the name of a king which is given thee But do not thou suffer these things to be hidden from thee nor do thou think to escape danger by being so careless of thyself and of thy king dom for Antipater and his sons are not now stewards of thine affairs do not thou deceive thyself with such a notion they are evidently absolute lords for Herod Antipater s son hath slain Hezekiah and those that were with him and hath thereby transgressed our law which hath forbidden to slay any man even though he were a wicked man unless he had been first  condemned to suffer death by the sanhedrim yet hath he been so insolent as to do this and that without any authority from thee 4 Upon Hyrcanus hearing this he complied with them The mothers also of those that had been slain by Herod raised this indignation for those women continued every day in the temple persuading the king and the people that Herod might undergo a trial before the sanhedrim for what he had done Hyrcanus was so moved by these complaints that he summoned Herod to come to his trial for what was charged upon him Accordingly he came but his father had persuaded him to come not like a private man but with a guard for the security of his person  and that when he had settled the affairs of Galilee in the best manner he could for his own advantage he should come to his trial but still with a body of men sufficient for his security on his journey yet so that he should not come with so great a force as might look like terrifying Hyrcanus but still such a one as might not expose him naked and unguarded to his enemies However Sextus Caesar president of Syria wrote to Hyrcanus and desired him to clear Herod and dismiss him at his trial and  It is here worth our while to remark that none could he put to death in Judea but by the approbation of the Jewish sanhedrim there being an excellent provision in the law of Moses that even in criminal causes and particularly where life was concerned an appeal should he from the lesser councils of seven in the other cities to the supreme council of seveniy one at Jerusalem And this is exactly according to our Saviour s words when he says  It could not be that a prophet should perish out of Jerusalem Luke xiii 33 VOL II M M 23 276 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS BookXIV threatened him beforehand if he did not do it Which epistle of his was the occasion of Hyrcanus delivering Herod from suffering any harm from the sanhedrim for he loved him as his own son But when Herod stood before the sanhedrim with his body of men about him he affrighted them all and no one of his former accusers durst after that bring any charge against him but there was a deep silence and nobody knew what was to be done When affairs stood thus one whose name was  Semeas a righteous man he was and for that reason above all fear who rose up and said O you that are assessors with me and O thou that art our king I neither have ever myself known such a case nor do I suppose that any one of you can name its parallel that one who is called to take his trial by us ever stood in such a manner before us but every one whosoever he be that comes to be tried by this sanhedrim presents himself in a submissive manner and like one that is in fear of himself and that en deavours to move us to compassion with his hair dishevelled and in a black mourning garment but this admirable man Herod who is accused of murder and called to answer so heavy an accusation stands here clothed in purple and with the hair of his head finely trimmed and with his armed men about him that if we shall condemn him by our law he may slay us and by overbearing justice may himself escape death Yet do not I make this complaint against Herod himself he is to be sure more concerned for himself than for the laws but my com plaint is against yourselves and your king who gave him a license so to do However take you notice that God is great and that this very man whom you are going to absolve and dismiss for the sake of Hyrcanus will one day pun ish both you and your king himself also Nor did Semeas mistake in any part of this prediction for when Herod had re ceived the kingdom he slew all the members of this sanhedrim and Hyrcanus himself also excepting Semeas for he had a great honour for him on account of his righteousness and because when the city was afterwards besieged by Herod and Sosius he persuaded the people to admit Herod into it and told them That for their sins they would not be able to escape his hands Which things will be related by us in their proper places 5 But when Hyrcanus saw that the members of the sanhe drim were ready to pronounce the sentence of death upon He rod he put off the trial to another day and sent privately to Herod and advised him to fly out of the city for that by this means he might escape So he retired to Damascus as though  This account as Hol md observes is confirmed by the Talmudiits who call this Semeas Simeon the ton of Shetach Chap X ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 277 he fled from the king and when he had been with Sextus Caesar and had put his own affairs in a sure posture he resolv ed to do thus that in case he were again summoned before the sanhedrim to take his trial he would not obey that summons Hereupon the members of the sanhedrim had great indignation at this posture of affairs and endeavoured to persuade Hyrcanus that all these things were against him Which state of matters he was not ignorant of but his temper was so unmanly and so foolish that he was able to do nothing at all But when Sextus had made Herod general of the army of Coelesyria for he sold him that post for money Hyrcanus was in fear lest Herod should make war upon him nor was the effect of what he feared long in coming upon him for Herod came and brought an army along with him to fight with Hyrcanus as being an gry at the trial he had been summoned to undergo before the sanhedrim but his father Antipater and his brother Phasae lus met him and hindered him from assaulting Jerusalem They also pacified his vehement temper and persuaded him to do no overt action but only to affright them with threatenings and to proceed no farther against one who had given him the dignity he had they also desired him not only to be angry that he was summoned and obliged to come to his trial but to re member withal how he was dismissed without condemnation and how he ought to give Hyrcanus thanks for the same and that he was not to regard only what was disagreeable to him and be unthankful for his deliverance So they desired him to consider that since it is God that turns the scales of war there is great uncertainty in the issues of battles and that there fore he ought not to expect the victory when he should fight with his king and him that had supported him and bestowed many benefits upon him and had done nothing itself very se vere to him for that his accusation which was derived from evil counsellors and not from himself had rather the suspicion of some severity than any thing really severe in it Herod was persuaded by these arguments and believed that it was sufficient for his future hopes to have made a show of his strength before the nation and done no more to it And in this state were the affairs of Judea at this time OHAP X The honours that were paid the Jews and the leagues that were made by the Romans and other nations with them Â 1 N ow when Caesar was come to Rome he was ready to sail into Africa to fight against Scipio and Cato when Hyrcau us sent ambassadors to him and by them desired that he 278 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XIV would ratify that league of friendship and mutual alliance which was between them And it seems to me to be necessary here to give an account of all the honours that the Romans and their emperors paid to our nation and of the leagues of mutual as sistance they have made with it that all the rest of mankind may know what regard the kings of Asia and Europe have had to us and that they have been abundantly satisfied of our courage and fidelity for whereas many will not believe what hath been written about us by the Persians and Macedonians because those writings are not every where to be met with nor do lie in public places but among us ourselves and certain other barbarous nations while there is no contradiction to be made against the decrees of the Romans for they are laid up in the public places of the cities and are extant still in the capitol and engraven upon pillars of brass nay besides this Julius Ca sar made a pillar of brass for the Jews at Alexandria and declar ed publicly that they were citizens of Alexandria Out of these evidences will I demonstrate what I say and will now set down the decrees made both by the senate and by Julius Caesar which relate to Hyrcanus and to our nation 2 Caius Julius Caesar imperator and high priest and dicta tor the second time to the magistrates senate and people of Sidon sendeth greeting if you be in health it is well I also and the army are well I have sent you a copy of that de cree registered on the tables which concerns Hyrcanus the son of Alexander the high priest and ethnarch of the Jews that it may be laid up among the public records and I will that it be openly proposed in a table of brass both in Greek and in Latin It is as follows I Julius Caesar imperator the second time and high priest have made this decree with the approbation of the senate Whereas Hyrcanus the son of Alexander the Jew hath demonstrated his fidelity and dili gence about our affairs and this both now and in former times both in peace and in war as many of our generals have borne witness and came to our assistance in the last  Alexandrian war with fifteen hundred soldiers and when he was sent by me to Mithridates showed himself superior in valour to all the rest of that army for these reasons I will that Hyrcanus the son of Alexander and his children be ethnarchs of the Jews and have the high priesthood of the Jews for ever according to the customs of their forefathers and that he and his sons be our confederates and that besides this every one of them be reckoned among our particular friends I also ordain  That Hyrcanus was himself in Egypt along with Antipater at this time to whom accordingly the bold and prudent actions of his deputy Antipater are here ascribed as this decree of Julius Czesar supposes we are farther assured by the testi mony of Strabo already produced by Joseptms chap viii sect 2 Chap X ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 279 that he and his children retain whatsoever privileges belong to the office of high priest or whatsoever favours have been hitherto granted them And if at any time hereafter there arise any questions about the Jewish customs I will that he determine the same And I think it not proper that they should be obliged to fmd us winter quarters or that any money should be required of them 3 The decrees of Caius Caesar consul containing what hath been granted and determined are as follows That Hyrcanus and his children bear rule over the nation of the Jews and have the profits of the places to them bequeathed and that he as himself the high priest and ethnarch of the Jews defend those that are injured And that ambassadors be sent to Hyr canus the son of Alexander the high priest of the Jews that may discourse with him about a league of friendship and mutual assistance and that a table of brass containing the premises be openly proposed in the capitol and at Sidon and Tyre and Askelon and in the temple engraven in Roman and Greek letters that this decree may also be communicated to the questors and pretors of the several cities and to the friends of the Jews and that the ambassadors may have pre sents made them that these decrees be sent every where 4 Caius Caesar imperator dictator consul hath granted That out of regard to the honour and virtue and kindness of the man and for the advantage of the senate and of the people of Rome Hyrcanus the son of Alexander both he and his children be high priests and priests of Jerusalem and of the Jewish nation by the same right and according to the same laws by which their progenitors have held the priesthood 5  Caius Caesar consul the fifth time hath decreed That the Jews shall possess Jerusalem and may encompass that city with walls and that Hyrcanus the son of Alexander the high priest and ethnarch of the Jews retain in the man ner he himself pleases and that the Jews be allowed to de duct out of their tribute every second year the land in let in the sabbatic period a corous of that tribute and that the tri bute they pay be not let to farm nor that they pay always the same tribute 6  Caius Caesar imperator the second time hath ordained That all the country of the Jews excepting Joppa do pay a tri bute yearly for the city Jerusalem excepting the seventh which they call the Sabbatical year because thereon they neither receive the fruits of their trees nor do they sow their land and that they pay their tribute in Sidon on the second year of that Sabbatical period the fourth part of what was sown and besides this they are to pay the same tithes to 280 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XIV Hyrcanus and his sons which they paid to their forefathers And that no one neither president nor lieutenant nor ambas sador raise auxiliaries within the bounds ofJudea nor my soldiers exact money of them for winter quarters or under any other pretence but that they be free from all sorts of injuries and that whatsoever they shall hereafter have and are in possession of or have bought they shall retain them all It is also our pleasure that the city Joppa which the Jews had originally when they made a league of friendship with the Romans shall belong to them as it formerly did and that Hyrcanus the son of Alexander and his sons have as tribute of that city from those that occupy the land for the country and for what they export every year to Sidon twenty thou sand six hundred and seventy five modii every year the se venth year which they call the Sabbatic year excepted where on they neither plough nor receive the product of their trees It is also the pleasure of the senate lhat as to the villages which are in the great plain which Hyrcanus and his forefa thers formerly possessed Hyrcanus and the Jews have them with the same privileges with which they formerly had them also and that the same original ordinances remain still in force which concern the Jews with regard to their high priests and that they enjoy the same benefits which they have had formerly by the concession of the people and of the senate and let them enjoy the like privileges in Lydda It is the plea sure also of the senate that Hyrcanus the ethnarch and the Jews retain those places countries and villages which be longed to the kings of Syria and Phenicia the confederates of the Romans and which they had bestowed on them as their free gifts It is also granted to Hyrcanus and to his sons and to the ambassadors by them sent to us that in the fights between single gladiators and in those with beasts they shall sit among the senators to see those shows and that when they desire an audience they shall be introduced into the senate by the dictator or by the general of the horse and when they have introduced them their answers shall be returned them in ten days at the farthest after the decree of the senate is made about their affairs 7 Caius Caesar imperator dictator the fourth time and consul the fifth time declared to be perpetual dictator made this speech concerning the rights and privileges of Hyrcanus the son of Alexander the high priest and ethnarch of the Jews Since those  imperators that have been in the provinces  Dr Hudson justly supposes that the Roman imperators or generals of ar mies meant both here and sect 2 who gave testimony to Hyrcanus and the Jews faithfulness and good will to the Romans before the senate and people of Rome Chap X ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 281 before me have borne witness to Hyrcanus the high priest of the Jews and to the Jews themselves and this before the senate and people of Rome when the people and senate re turned their thanks to them it is good that we now also re member the same and provide that a requital be made to Hyrcanus to the nation of the Jews and to the sons of Hyr canus by the senate and people of Rome and that suitably to what good will they have shown us and to the benefits they have bestowed upon us 8 Julius Caius pretor consul of Rome to the magistrates senate and people of the Parians sendeth greeting The Jews of Delos and some other Jews that sojourn there in the pre sence of your ambassadors signified to us that by a decree of yours you forbid them to make use of the customs of their forefathers and their way of sacred worship Now it does not please me that such decrees should be made against our friends and confederates whereby they are forbidden to live according to their own customs or to bring in contributions for common suppers and holy festivals while they are not forbidden so to do even at Rome itself for even Caius Caesar our imperator and consul in thatdecree wherein he forbade the Bacchanal rioters to meet in the city did yet permit these Jews and these only both to bring in their contributions and to make their common suppers Accordingly when I forbid other Bacchanal rioters I permit these Jews to gather themselves together according to the customs and laws of their forefathers and to persist therein It will be therefore good for you that if you have made any decree against these our friends and confederates to abrogate the same by reason of their virtue and kind disposition towards us 9 Now after Caius was slain when Marcus Antonius and Publius Dolabella were consuls they both assembled the senate and introduced Hyrcanus ambassadors into it and discoursed of what they desired and made a league of friendship with them The senate also decreed to grant them all they desired I add the decree itself that those who read the present work may have ready by them a demonstration of the truth of what we say the decree was this 10 The decree of the senate copied out of the treasury from the public tables belonging to the questors when Quin tus Rutilius and Caius Cornelius were questors and taken out of the second table of the first class on the third day before the ides of April in the temple of Concord There ere principally Pompey Scaurus and Gabinius of all whom Joseplius had already given us the history so far as the Jews were concerned with them 282 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JKWS Book XIV were present at the writing of this decree Lucius Culpurnius Piso of the Menenian tribe Servius Papinias Potitus of the Lemonian tribe Caius Caninius Rebiiius of the Terentine tribe Publius Tidetius Lucius Apulinus the son of Lucius of the Sergian tribe Flavius the son of Lucius of the Lemo nian tribe

son of Marcus of the Pol lian tribe and Publius Serius Publius Dolabella and Mar cus Antonius the consuls made this reference to the senate that as to those things which by the decree of the senate Caius Ca3sar had adjudged about the Jews and yet had not hitherto that decree brought into the treasury it is our will as it is also the desire of Publius Dolabella and Marcus Antonius our consuls to have these decrees put into the public tables and brought to the city questors that they may take care to have them put upon the double tables This was done before the fifth of the ides of February in the temple of Concord Now the ambassadors from Hyrcanus the high priest were these Lysimachus the son of Pausanius Alexander the son of The odorus Patroculus the son of Cheras and Jonathan the son of Onias 11 Hyrcanus sent also one of these ambassadors to Dolabella who was then the prefect of Asia and desired him to dismiss the Jews from military services and to preserve to them the customs of their forefathers and to permit them to live ac cording to them And when Dolabella had received Hyrcan us letter without any farther deliberation he sent an epistle to all the Asiatics and particularly to the city of the Ephesians the metropolis of Asia about the Jews a copy of which epistle here follows 12 When Artemon was prytanis on the first day of the month Leneon Dolabella imperator to the senate and magis trates and people of the Ephesians sendeth greeting Alex ander the son of Theodorus the ambassador of Hyrcanus the son of Alexander the high priest and ethnarch of the Jews appeared before me to show that his countrymen could not go into their armies because they are not allowed to bear arms or to travel on the Sabbath days nor there to procure themselves those sorts of food which they have been used to eat from the times of their forefathers I do therefore grant them a freedom from going into the army as the former pre fects have done and permit them to use the customs of their forefathers in assembling together for sacred and religious purposes as their law requires and for collecting oblations Chap X ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 283 necessary for sacrifices and my will is that you writ this to the several cities under your jurisdiction 13 And these were the concessions that Dolabella made to our nation when Hyrcanus sent an embassage to him But Lucius the consul s decree ran thus I have at my tribunal set these Jews who are citizens of Rome and follow the Jewish reli gious rites and yet live at Ephesus free from going into the army on account of the superstition they are under This was done before the twelfth of the calends of October when Lucius Lentullus and Cains Marcellus were consuls of the presence of Titus Appius Balgus the son of Titus and lieuten ant of the Horatian tribe of Titus Tongius the son of Titus of the Crustamine tribe of Quintus Resius the son of Quin tus of Titus Pompius Longinus the son of Titus of Caius

Sabbatine tribe of Titus Attilius Bulbus the son of Titus lieutenant and vice praetor to the magistrates senate and people of the Ephesians sendeth greeting Lucius Lentul lus the consul freed the Jews that are in Asia from going into the armies at my intercession for them And when 1 had made the same petition sometime afterward to Phanius the imperator and to Lucius Antonius the vice questor I obtain ed that privilege of them also and my will is that you take care that no one give them any disturbance 14 The decree of the Delians The answer of the pretors when Beotus was archon on the twentieth day of the month Thargeleon while Marcus Piso the lieutenant lived in our city who was also appointed over the choice of the soldiers he called us and many other of the citizens and gave order that if there be here any Jews who are Roman citizens no one is to give them any disturbance about going into the ar my because Cornelius Lentullus the consul freed the Jews from going into the army on account of the superstition they are under you are therefore obliged to submit to the pretor And the like decree was made by the Sardians about us also 15 Caius Phanius the son of Caius imperator and consul  to the magistrates of Cos sendeth greeting I would have you know that the ambassadors of the Jews have been with me and desired they might have those decrees which the senate had made about them which decrees are here subjoined My will is that you have a regard to and take care of these men according to the senate s decree that they may be safely con veyed home through your country VOL II N N S8 284 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XIV 16 The declaration of Lucius Lentullus the consul I have  dismissed those Jews who are Roman citizens and who ap  pear to me to have their religious rites and to observe the laws of the Jews at Ephesus on account of the superstition they are under This act was done before the thirteenth of the calends of October 17 Lucius Antonius the son of Marcus vice questor and vice pretor to the magistrates senate and people of the Sardians sendeth greeting those Jews that are our fellow citizens of Rome came to me and demonstrated that they had an assembly of their own according to the laws of their forefathers and this from the beginning as also a place of their own wherein they determined their suits and controver sies with one another Upon their petition therefore to me that these might be lawful for them I gave order that these their privileges be preserved and they be permitted to do accordingly 18 The declaration of Marcus Publius the son of Spurius and of Marcus the son of Marcus and of Lucius the son of Pub lius We went to the proconsul and informed him of what Dositheus the son of Cleopatrida of Alexandria desired that if he thought good he would dismiss those Jews who were Roman citizens and were wont to observe the rites of the Jewish religion on account of the superstition they were un der Accordingly he did dismiss them This was done be fore the thirteenth of the calends of October 19 In the month Quintilis when Lucius Lentullus and Caius Marcellus were consuls and there were present Titus Appius Bulbus

the tribunal dismissed those Jews that are Ro man citizens and are accustomed to observe the sacred rites of the Jews at Ephesus on account of the superstition they are under Chap X ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWg 285 20 The magistrates of the Laodiceans to Caius Rubilius the son of Caius the consul sendeth greeting Sopater the ambassador of Hyrcanus the high priest hath delivered us an epistle from thee whereby he lets us know that certain am bassadors were come from Hyrcanus the high priest of the Jews and brought an epistle written concerning their nation wherein they desire that the Jews may be allowed to observe their Sabbaths and other sacred rites according to the laws of their forefathers and that they may be under no command because they are our friends and confederates and that no body may injure them in our provinces Now although the Trallians there present contradicted them and were not pleased with these decrees yet didst thou give order that they should be observed and informedst us that thou hadst been desired to write this to us about them We therefore in obe dience to the injunctions we have received from thee have received the epistle which thou sentest us and have laid it up by itself among our public records And as to the other things about which thou didst send to us we will take care that no complaint be made against us 21 Publius Servillius the son of Publius of the Galban tribe the proconsul to the magistrates senate and people of the Milesians sendeth greeting Prytanes the son of Hermes a citizen of yours came to me when I was at Tralles ano held a court there and informed me that you used the Jews in a way different from my opinion and forbade them to ce lebrate their Sabbaths and to perform the sacred rites re ceived from their forefathers and to manage the fruits of the land according to their ancient custom and that he had him self been the promulger of your decree according as your laws require I would therefore have you know that upon hearing the pleadings on both sides I gave sentence that the Jews should not be prohibited to make use of their own cus toms 22 The decree of those of Pergamus When Cratippus was prytanis on the first day of the month Desius the decree of the pretors was this Since the Romans following the conduct of their ancestors undertake dangers for the common safety of all mankind and are ambitious to settle their confederates and friends in happiness and in firm peace and since the nation of the Jews and their high priest Hyrcanus sent as ambas sadors to them Strato the son of Theodatus and Apollonius the son of Alexander and Eneas die son of Antipater and Aristobulus the son of Amyntus and Sosipater the son of Philip worthy and good men who gave a particular account of their affairs the senate thereupon made a decree about what 286 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XIV they had desired of them that Antiochus the king the son of Antiochus should do no injury to the Jews the confede rates of the Romans and that the fortresses and the havens and the country and whatsoever else he had taken from them should be restored to them and that it may be lawful for them to export their goods out of their own havens and that no king nor people may have leave to export any goods either out of the country of Judea or out of their havens with out paying customs but only Ptolemy the king of Alexan dria because he is our confederate and friend and that ac cording to their desire the garrison that is in Joppa may be ejected Now Lucius Petius one of our senators a worthy and good man gave order that we should take care that these things should be done according to the senate s decree and that we should take care also that their ambassadors might return home in safety Accordingly we admitted Theodorus into our senate and assembly and took the epistle out of his hands as well as the decree of the senate And as he dis coursed with great zeal about the Jews and described Hyr canus virtue and generosity and how he was a benefactor to all men in common and particularly to every body that comes to him we laid up the epistle in our public records and made a decree ourselves that since we also are in confe deracy with the Romans we would do every thing we could for the Jews according to the senate s decree Theodorus also who brought the epistle desired of our pretors that they would send Hyrcanus a copy of that decree as also ambassa dors to signify to him the affection of our people to him and to exhort them to preserve and augment their friendship for us and be ready to bestow other benefits upon us as justly expecting to receive proper requitals from us and desiring them to remember that our  ancestors were friendly to the Jews even in the days of Abraham who was the father of ali  We have here a most remarkable and authentic attestation of the citizens of Pergamus that Abraham was the father of all the Hebrews that their own an cestors were in the oldest time the friends of those Hebrews and that the public acts of their city then extant confirmed the same which evidence is too strong to be evaded by our present ignorance of the particular occasion of such ancient

those people to the Jews preserved in the first book of Maccabees xii 19â 23 and thence by Josephus Antiq B XII chap iv sect 1O both which authentic records are highly valuable It is also Well worthy

23 The decree of those of Helicarnasus When Memnon the son of Oristidas by descent but by adoption of Eunonymus was priest on the    day of the month Aristerion the decree of the people upon the representation of Marcus Alexander was this Since we have ever a great regard to piety towards God and to holiness and since we aim to follow the people of the Romans who are the benefactors of all men and what they have written to us about a league of friendship and mutual assistance between the Jews and our city and that their sa cred offices and accustomed festivals and assemblies may be observed by them we have decreed that as many men and women of the Jews as are willing so to do may celebrate their Sabbaths and perform their holy offices according to the Jewish laws and may make their proseuchffl at the seaside according to the customs of their forefathers and if any one whether he be a magistrate or private person hindereth them from so doing he shall be liable to a fine to be applied to the uses of the city 24 The decree of the Sardians This decree was made by tlÂ e senate and people upon the representation of the pretors Whereas those Jews who are our fellow citizens and live with us in this city have ever had great benefits heaped upon them by the people and have come now into the senate and desired of the people that upon the restitution of their law and their liberty by the senate and people of Rome they may assemble together according to their ancient legal custom and that we will not bring any suit against them about it and that a place may be given them where they may have their congregations with their wives and children and may offer as did their forefathers their prayers and sacrifices to God  now the senate and people have decreed to permit them to as semble together on the days formerly appointed and to act according to their own laws and that such a place be set apart for them by the pretors for the building and inhabiting the same as they shall esteem fit for that purpose And that those that take care of the provisions for the city shall take care that such sorts of food as they esteem fit for their eating may be imported into the city 25 The decree of the Ephesians When Menophilus was prytanis on the first day of the month Artemisius this decree was made by the people Nicanor the son of Euphemius pro nounced it upon the representation of the pretors Since the Jews that dwell in this city have petitioned Marcus Julius Pompeius the son of Brutus the proconsul that they might 2S8 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XIV be allowed to observe their Sabbaths and to act in all things according to the customs of their forefathers without impedi M ment from any body the pretor hath granted their petition Accordingly it was decreed by the senate and people that in this affair that concerned the Romans no one of them should be hindered from keeping the Sabbath day nor be fined for so doing but that they may be allowed to do all things accord ing to their own laws 26 Now there are  many such decrees of the senate and im perators of the Romans and those different from these before us which have been made in favour of Hyrcanus and of our nation as also there have been more decrees of the city and rescripts of the pretors to such epistles as concerned our rights and privileges and certainly such as are not ill disposed to what we write may believe that they are all to this purpose and that by the specimens which we have inserted for since we have produced evident marks that may still be seen of the friend ship we have had with the Romans and demonstrated that those marks are engraven upon columns and tables of brass in the capitol that are still in being and preserved to this day we have omitted to set them all down as needless and disagreeable for I cannot suppose any one so perverse as not to believe the friendship we have had with the Romans while they have de monstrated the same by such a great number of their decrees relating to nor will they doubt of our fidelity as to the rest of those decrees since we have showed the same in those we have produced And thus have we sufficiently explained that friend ship and confederacy we at those times had with the Romans CHAP XI  How f Marcus succeeded Sextus when he had been slain by Bassus treachery  and how after the death of Ctesar Cassias came into Syria and distressed Judea  as also how Molichus slew Antipater and was himself slain by Herod J 1 JN ow it so fell out that about this very time the affairs of Syria were in great disorder and this on the occasion fol  If we compare Josephus promise in sect 1 to produce all the public decrees of the Romans in favour of the Jews with his excuse here for omitting many of them we may observe that when he came to transcribe all those decrees he had collected he found them so numerous that he thought he should too much tire his readers if he had attempted it which he thought a sufficient apology for his omitting the rest of them yet do those by him produced afford such a strong confirmation to his history and give such great light to even the Roman Antiquities themselves that I believe the curious are not a little sorry for such his omission f For Marcus the president of Syria sent us successor to Sextus Caesar the Chap XI  ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 289 lowing Cecilius Bassus one of Pompey s party laid a treach erous design against Sextus Caesar and slew him and then took his army and got the management of public affairs into his own hand so there arose a great war about Apamia while Cae sar s generals came against him with an army of horsemen and footmen To these Antipater also sent succours and his sons with them as calling to mind the kindnesses they had received from Caesar and on that account he thought it but just to require punishment for him and to take vengeance on the man that had murdered him And as the war was drawn out into a great length Marcus came from Rome to take Sextus government upon him But Caesar was slain by Cassius and Brutus in the senate house after he had retained the government three years and six months This fact however is related elsewhere 2 As the war that arose upon the death of Caesar was now begun and the principal men were all gone some one way and some another to raise armies Cassius came from Rome into Syria in order to receive the army that lay in the camp at Apamia and having raised the siege he brought over both Bas sus and Marcus to his party He then went over the cities and got together weapons and soldiers and laid great taxes upon those cities and he chiefly oppressed Judea and exacted of it seven hundred talents But Antipater when he saw the state to be in so great consternation and disorder he divided the collec tion of that sum and appointed his two sons to gather it and so that part of it was to be exacted by Malichus who was ill disposed to him and part by others And because Herod did exact what is required of him from Galilee before others he was in the greatest favour with Cassius for he thought it a part of prudence to cultivate a friendship with the Romans and to gain their good will at the expense of others whereas the curators of the other cities with their citizens were sold for slaves and Cassius reduced four cities into slavery the two most potent of which were Gophna and Emmaus and besides these Lydia and Thamna Nay Cassius was so very angry at Malichus that he had killed him for he assaulted him had not Hyrcanus by the means of Antipater sent him a hun dred talents of his own and thereby pacified his anger against him 3 But after Cassius was gone out of Judea Malichus laid snares for Antipater as thinking that his death would be the preserva tion of Hyrcanus government But his design was not unknown Roman historians require us to read Marcus in Josephus and tliis perpetually l oth in these Antiquities and in the history of the Wars as the learned generally â gree 190 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XIV to Anlipater which when he perceived he retired beyond Jordan and got together an army partly of Arabs and partly of his own countrymen However Mulichus being one of great cun ning denied that he had laid any snares for him and made his defence with an oath both to himself and his sons and said that while Phasaelus had a garrison in Jerusalem and Herod had the weapons of war in his custody he could never have a thought of any such thing So Antipater perceiving the distress that Malichus was in was reconciled to him and made an agree ment with him this was when Marcus was president of Syria who yet perceiving that this Malichus was making a disturbance in Judea proceeded so far that he had almost killed him but still at the intercession of Antipater he saved him 4 However Antipater little thought that by saving Mali chus he had saved his own murderer for now Cassius and Marcus had got together an army and intrusted the entire care of it with Herod and made him general of the Ibrces ot Ccele syria and gave him a fleet of ships and an army of horsemen and footmen and promised him that after the war was over they would make him king of Judea for a war was already be gun between Antony and the younger Cassar But as Malichus was most afraid of Antipater he took him out of the way and by the offer of money persuaded the butler of Hyrcanus with whom they were both to feast to kill him by poison This being done and he having armed men with him settled the af fairs of the city But when Antipater s sons Herod and Pha saalus were acquainted with this conspiracy against their father and had indignation at it Malichus denied all and utterly re nounced any knowledge of the murder And thus died Anti pater a man that had distinguished himself for piety and justice and love to his country And whereas one of his sons Herod resolved immediately to revenge their father s death and was coming upon Malichus with an army for that purpose the el der of his sons Phasaelus thought it best rather to get this man into their hands by policy lest they should appear to begin a civil war in the country so he accepted of Malichus defence for himself and pretended to believe him that he had no hand in the violent death of Antipater his father but erected a fine monument for him Herod also went to Samaria and when he found them in great distress he revived their spirits and com posed their differences 5 However a little after this Herod upon the approach o a festival came with his soldiers unto the city whereupon Mp liclms was affrighted and persuaded Hyrcanus not to permit him to come into the city Hyrcanus complied and for a pretence of excluding him alleged that a rout of strangers Chap XI ANTIQUIT1KS OF THE JEWS 291 ought not to he admitted when the multitude were purifying themselves But Herod had little regard to the messengers that were sent to him and entered the city in the night time and af frighted Malichus yet did he remit nothing of his former dissi mulation but wept for Antipater and bewailed him as a friend of his with a loud voice But Herod and his friends thought it proper not openly to contradict Malichus hypocrisy but to give him tokens of mutual friendship in order to prevent his suspicion of them 6 However Herod sent to Cassius and informed him of the murder of his father who knowing what sort of man Malichus was as to his morals sent him back word that he should revenge his father s death and also sent privately to the commanders of his army at Tyre with orders to assist Herod in the execution of a very just design of his Now when Cassius had taken Lao dicea they all went together to him and carried him garlands and money and Herod thought that Malichus might be punish ed while he was there but he was somewhat apprehensive of the thing and designed to make some great attempt and because his son was then an hostage at Tyre he went to that city and resolved to steal him away privately and to march thence into Judea and as Cassius was in haste to march against Antony he thought to bring the country to revolt and to procure the go vernment for himself But providence opposed his counsels and Herod being a shrewd man and perceiving what his inten tion was he sent thither beforehand a servant in appearance indeed to get a supper ready for he had said before that he would feast them all there but in reality to the commanders of the army whom he persuaded to go out against Malichus with their daggers So they went out and met the man near the city upon the seashore and stabbed him Whereupon Hyrcanus was so astonished at what had happened that his speech failed him and when after some difficulty he had recovered himself he asked Herod what the matter could be and who it was that slew Malichus and when he said that it was done by the com mand of Cassius he commended the action for that Malichus was a very wicked man and one that conspired against his own country And this was the punishment that was inflicted on Malichus for what he wickedly did to Antipater 7 But when Cassius was marched out of Syria disturbances arose in Judea for Felix who was left at Jerusalem with an army made a sudden attempt against Phasaelus and the people themselves rose in arms but Herod went to Fabius the prelect of Damascus and was desired to run to his brother s assistance but was hindered by a distemper that seized upon him till Pha saelus by himself had been too hard for Felix and had shut him VOL II O O 23 29 2 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XIV up in the tower and there on certain conditions dismissed him Phasaelus also complained of Hyrcanus that although he had received a great many benefits from them yet did he support their enemies for Malichus brother made many places to re volt and kept garrisons in them and particularly Masada the strongest fortress of them all In the meantime Herod was re covered of his disease and came and took from Felix all the places he had gotten and upon certain conditions dismissed him also CHAP XII Herod ejects Antigonus the son of Aristolndus out of Judea and gains the friendship of Antony who was now come into Syria by sending him much money on which account he would not admit of those that would have accused Herod  and what it was that Antony wrote to the Tyrians in behalf of the Jews Â 1 JN ow  Ptolemy the son of Menneus brought back into Judea Antigonus the son of Aristobulus who had already raised an army and had by money made Fabius to be his friend and this because he was of kin to him Marion also gave him assistance He had been left by Cassius to tyrannize over Tyre for this Cassius was a man that seized on Syria and then kept it under in the way of a tyrant Marion also marched into Ga lilee which lay in his neighbourhood and took three of his for tresses and put garrisons into them to keep them But when Herod came he took all from him  but the Tyrian garrison he dismissed in a very civil manner nay to some of the soldiers he made presents out of the good will he bore to that city When he had dispatched these affairs and was gone to meet Antigonus he joined battle with him and beat him and drove him out of Judea presently when he was just come into its borders But when he was come to Jerusalem Hyrcanus and the people put garlands about his head for he had already contracted an af finity with the family of Hyrcanus by having espoused a descen dantof his andfor that reason Herod took the greater care of him  In this and the following chapters the reader will easily remark how truly Gro novius observes in his notes on the Roman decrees in favour of the Jews that their rights and privileges were commonly purchased of the Romans with money Many examples of this sort both as to the Romans and others in authority will occur in our Josephus both now and hereafter and need not be taken particular notice of on the several occasions in these notes Accordingly the chief captain confesses to St Paul that  with a great sum be had obtained his freedom Act xxii 28 a had Paul s ancestors very probably purchased the like freedom for their family by money as the same author justly concludes also Chap XII ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 293 as being to marry the daughter of Alexander the son of Aristo bulus and the granddaughter of Hyrcanus by which wife he became the father of three male and two female children He had also married before this another wife out of a lower family of his own nation whose name was Doris by whom he had his eldest son Antipater 2 Now Antonius and Caesar had beaten Cassius near Philippi as others have related but after the victory Caesar went into Gaul Italy and Antony marched for Asia who when he was arrived at Bythinia he had ambassadors that met him from all parts The principal men also of the Jews came thither to ac cuse Phasaelus and Herod and they said that Hyrcanus had in deed the appearance of reigning but that these men had all the power but Antony paid great respect to Herod who was come to him to make his defence against his accusers on which account his adversaries could not so much as obtain a hearing which favour Herod had gained of Antony by money But still when Antony was come to Ephesus Hyrcanus the high priest and our nation sent an embassage to him who carried a crown of gold with them and desired that he would write to the governors of the provinces to set those Jews free who had been carried cap tive by Cassius and this without their having fought against him and to restore them that country which in the days of Cassius had been taken from them Antony thought the Jews desires were just and wrote immediately to Hyrcanus and to the Jews He also sent at the same time a decree to the Tyrians the contents of which were to the same purpose 3  Marcus Antonius imperator to Hyrcanus the high priest and ethnarch of the Jews sendeth greeting If you be in health it is well I also am in health with the army Ly simachus the son of Pausanius and Josephus the son of Men neus and Alexander the son of Theodorus your ambassadors met me at Ephesus and have renewed that embassage which they had formerly been upon at Rome and have diligently ac quitted themselves of the present embassage which thou and thy nation have entrusted to them and have fully declared the good will thou hast for us I am therefore satisfied both by your actions and your words that you are well disposed to us and I understand that your conduct of life is constant and religious so I reckon upon you as our own but when those that were adversaries to you and to the Roman people and abstained neither from cities nor temples and did notob serve the agreement they had confirmed by oath it was not only on account of our contest with them but on account of all mankind in common that we have taken vengeance on those who have been the authors of great injustice towards men 294 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XIV and of great wickedness towards the gods for the sake of which we suppose it was that the  sun turned away his light from us as unwilling to view the horrid crime they were guilty of in the case of Caesar We have also overcome their conspiracies which threatened the gods themselves which Macedonia re ceived as it is a climate peculiarly proper for impious and in solent attempts and we have overcome that confused rout of men half mad with spite against us which they got together at Philippi in Macedonia when they seized on the places that were proper for their purpose and as it were walled them round with mountains to the very sea and where the passage was open only through a single gate This victory we gained because the gods had condemned these men for their wicked enterprizes Now Brutus when he had fled as far as Philip pi was shut up by us and became a partaker of the same per dition with Cassius and now these have received their pun ishment we suppose that we may enjoy peace for the time to come and that Asia may be at rest from war We therefore make that peace which God hath given us common to our con federates also insomuch that the body of Asia is now recover ed out of that distemper it was under by the means of our victory I therefore bearing in mind both thee and your nation shall take care of what may be for your advantage I have also sent epistles in writing to the several cities that if any persons whether freemen or bondmen have been sold un der the spear by Caius Cassius or his subordinate officers they may be set free And I will that you kindly make use of the favours which I and Dolabella have granted you I also forbid the Tyrians to use any violence with you and for what places of the Jews they now possess I order them to restore them I have withal accepted of the crown which thou sentest me 4  Marcus Antonius imperator to the magistrates senate andpeopleof Tyre sendethgreeting TheambassadorsofHyr canus the high priest and ethnarch of the Jews

for the obtaining the government and have taken care to do what was agreeable to piety and justice and have brought to punishment those that had neither any re membrance of the kindnesses they had received nor have kept Â This clause plainly alludes to that well known but unusual and very long dark ness of the sun which happened upon the murder of Julius Csesar by Brutus and Cassius which is greatly taken notice of by Virgil Pliny and other Roman authors See Virgil s Georgics Book I just before the end and Pliny s Nat Hist B IL ilt XXX Chap XII ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS their oaths I will that you be at peace with those that are our confederates as also that what you have taken by the means of our adversaries shall not be reckoned your own but be return ed to those from whom you took them for none of them took their provinces or their armies by the gift of the senate but they seized them by force and bestowed them by violence upon such as became useful to them in their unjust proceed ings Since therefore those men have received the punish  ment due to them we desire that our confederates may retain whatsoever it was that they formerly possessed without dis turbance and that you restore all the places which belong to Hyrcanus the ethnarch of the Jews which you have had though it were but one day before Caius Cassius began an un justifiable war against us and entered into our province nor do you use any force against him in order to weaken him that he may not be able to dispose of that which is his own but if you have any contest with him about your respective rights it shall be lawful for you to plead your cause when we come upon the places concerned for we shall alike preserve the rights and hear all the causes of our confederates 5  Marcus Antonius imperator to the magistrates senate and people of Tyre sendeth greeting I have sent you my decree of which I will that ye take care that it be engraven on the public tables in Roman and Greek letters and that it stand engraven in the most illustrious places that it may be read by all Marcus Antonius imperator one of the tri umvirate over the public affairs made this declaration Since Caius Cassius in this revolt he hath made hath pillaged that province which belonged not to him and was held by gar risons there encamped while they were our confederates and hath spoiled that nation of the Jews that was in friendship with the Roman people as in war and since we have over come his madness by arms we now correct by our decrees and judicial determinations what he hath laid waste that those things may be restored to our confederates And as for what hath been sold of the Jewish possessions whether they be bodies or possessions let them be released the bodies into that state of freedom they were originally in and the posses sions to their former owners I also will that he who shall not comply with this decree of mine shall be punished for his disobedience and if such a one be caught I will take care that the offenders suffer condign punishment 6 The same thing did Antony write to the Sidonians and the Antiochians and the Arabians We have produced these de crees therefore as marks for futurity of the truth of what we have said that the Romans had a great concern about our nation 296 ANTIQUITIES OK THE JEWS Book XIV CHAP XIII Harm Antony made Herod and Phasaelus tetrarchs after they had been accused to no purpose and how the Parthians when they brought Antigonus into Judea took Hyrcanus and Pha saelus captives Herod s fight and what afflictions Hyrcanus and Phasaelus endured  1 WHEN after this Antony came into Syria Cleopatra met him in Cilicia and brought him to fall in love with her And there came now also a hundred of the most potent of the Jews to accuse Herod and those about him and set the men of the greatest eloquence among them to speak But Messala contradicted them on behalf of the young men and all this in the presence of Hyrcanus who was  Herod s father in law already When Antony had heard both sides at Daphne he asked Hyrcanus who they were that governed the nation best He replied Herod and his friends Hereupon Antony by rea son of the old hospitable friendship he had made with his father Antipater at that time when he was with Gubinius he made both Herod and Phasaelus tetrarchs and committed the public affairs of the Jews to them and wrote letters to that purpose He also bound fifteen of their adversaries and was going to kill them but that Herod obtained their pardon 2 Yet did not these men continue quiet when they were come back but a thousand of the Jews came to Tyre to meet him there whither the report was that he would come But Anto ny was corrupted by the money which Herod and his brother had given him and so he gave order to the governor of the place to punish the Jewish ambassadors who were for making inno vations and to settle the government upon Herod but Herod went out hastily to them and Hyrcanus was with him for they stood upon the shore before the city and he charged them to go their ways because great mischief would befall them if they went on with their accusation But they did not acquiesce whereupon the Romans ran upon them with their daggers and slew some and wounded more of them and the rest fled away and went home and lay still in great consternation and when the people made a clamour against Herod Antony was so pro voked at it that he slew the prisoners 3 Now in the second year Pacorus the king of Parthia s  We may here take notice that espousals alone were of old esteemed a sufficient foundation for affmity Hyrcanus being here called father in law to Herod because his grand daughter Mariamne was betrothed to him although the marriage was not completed till four years afterward See Mat i 16 Chap XIII ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEW8 297 son and Barzaphames a commander of the Parthians possessed themselves of Syria Ptolemy the son of Menncus also was now dead and Lysanias his son took his goverment and made a league of friendship with Antigonus the son of Aristobulus and in order to obtain it made use of that commander who had great interest in him Now Antigonus had promised to give the Parthians athousand talents and five hundred women upon con ditions they would take the government away from Hyrcanus and bestow it upon him and withal kill Herod And although he did not give them what he had promised yet did the Par thians make an expedition into Judea on that account and car ried Antigonus with them Pacorus went along the maritime parts but the commander Barzapharnes through the midland Now the Tyrians excluded Pacorus but the Sidonians and those of Ptolemais received him However Pacorus sent a troop of horsemen into Judea to take a view of the state of the country and to assist Antigonus and sent also the king s butler of the same name with himself So when the Jews that dwelt about mount Carmel came to Antigonus and were ready to march with him into Judea Antigonus hoped to get some part of the country by their assistance The place is called Drymi and when some others came and met them the men privately fell upon Jerusalem and when some more were come to them they got together in great numbers and came against the king s palace and besieged it But as Phasaelus and Herod s party came to the other s assistance and a battle happened between them in the market place the young men beat their enemies and pursued them into the temple and sent some armed men in to the adjoining houses to keep them in who yet being desti tute of such as should support them were burnt and the houses with them by the people who rose up against them But He rod was revenged on these seditious adversaries of his a little af terward for this injury they had offered himÂ when he fought with them and slew a great number of them 4 But while there were daily skirmishes the enemy waited for the coming of the multitude out of the country to Pentecost a feast of ours so called and when that day was come many ten thousands of the people were gathered together about the temple some in armour and some without Now those that came guarded both the temple and the city excepting what belonged to the palace which Herod guarded with a few of his soldiers and Phasaelus had the charge of the wall while He rod with a body of his men sallied out upon the enemy who lay in the suburbs and fought courageously and put many ten thousands to flight some flying into the city and some into the temple and some into the outer fortifications for some such 298 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XIV fortifications there were in that place Phasaelus came also to his assistance yet was Pacorus the general of the Parthians at the desire of Antigonus admitted into the city with a few of his horsemen under pretence indeed as if he would still the se dition but in reality to assist Antigonus in obtaining the go vernment And when Phasaelus met him and received him kindly Pacorus persuaded him to go himself as ambassador to Barzapharnes which was done fraudulently Accordingly Pha saelus suspecting no harm complied with his proposal while Herod did not give his consent to what was done because of the perfidiousness of these Barbarians but desired Phasaelus rather to fight those that were come into the city 5 So both Hyrcanus and Phasaelus went on the embassage but Pacorus left with Herod two hundred horsemen and ten men who were called The freemen and conducted the others on their journey and when they were in Galilee the governors of the cities there met them in their arms Barzapharnes also received them at the first with cheerfulness and made them presents though he afterward conspired against them and Pha saelus with his horsemen were conducted to the seaside But when they heard that Antigonus had promised to give the Par thians a thousand talents and five hundred women to assist him against them they soon had a suspicion of the Barbarians Moreover there was one who informed them that snares were laid for them by night while a guard came secretly and they had then been seized upon had not they waited for the seizure of Herod by the Parthians that were about Jerusalem lest upon the slaughter of Hyrcanus and Phasaelus he should have an intimation of it and escape out of their hands And these were the circumstances they were now in and they saw who they were that guarded them Some persons indeed would have per suaded Phasaelus to fly away immediately on horseback and not stay any longer and there was one Ophellius who above all the rest was earnest with him to do so for he had heard of this treachery from Saramalla the richest of all the Syrians at that time who also promised to provide him ships to carry him off for the sea was just by them but he had no mind to desert Hyrcanus nor bring his brother into danger but he went to Barzapharnes and told him he did not act justly when he made such a contrivance against them for that if he wanted money he would give him more than Antigonus and besides that it was a horrible thing to slay those that came to him upon the security of their oaths and that when they had done them no injury But the Barbarian swore to him that there was no truth in any of his suspicions but that he was troubled with nothing but false proposals and then went away to Pacorus Chap XIII ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 299 6 But as soon as he was gone away some men came and bound Hyrcanus and Phasaelus while Phasaelus greatly re proached the Parthians for their perjury However that but ler who was sent against Herod had it in command to get him without the walls of the city and seize upon him but messen gers had been sent by Phasaelus to inform Herod of the per fuliousness of the Parthians Arid when he knew that the enemy had seized upon them he went to Pocorus and to the most po tent of the Parthians as to the lords of the rest who although they knew the whole matter dissembled with him in a deceit ful way and said That he ought to go out with them before the walls and meet those who were bringing him his letters for that they were not taken by his adversaries but were coming to give him an account of the good success Phasaelus had had Herod did not give credit to what they said for he had heard that his brother was seized upon by others also and the daughter of Hyrcanus whose daughter he had espoused was his monitor also not to credit them which made him still more suspicious of the Parthians for although other people did not give heed to her yet did he believe her as a woman of very great wisdom 7 Now while the Parthians were in consultation what was fit to be done for they did not think it proper to make an open attempt upon a person of his character and while they put off the determination to the next day Herod was under great dis turbance of mind and rather inclining to believe the reports he heard about his brother and the Parthians than to give heed to what was said on the other side he determined that when the evening came on he would make use of it for his flight and not make any longer delay as if the dangers from the enemy were not yet certain He therefore removed with the armed men whom he had with him and set his wives upon the beasts as also his mother and sister and her whom he was about to marry Mariamne the daughter of Alexander the son of Aristo bulus with her mother the daughter of Hyrcanus and his youngest brother and all their servants and the rest of the mul titude that was with him and without the enemies privity pur sued his way to Idumea Nor could any enemy of his who then saw him in this case be so hard hearted but would have com miserated his fortune while the women drew along their infant children and left their own country and their friends in prison with tears in their eyes and sad lamentations and in expecta tion of nothing but what was of a melancholy nature 8 But for Herod himself he raised his mind above the mi serable state he was in and was of good courage in the midst of his misfortunes and as he passed along he bid them every one VOL II P V 25 300 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XIV be of good cheer and not to give themselves up to sorrow be cause that would hinder them in their flight which was now the only hope of safety that they had Accordingly they tried to bear with patience the calamity they were under as he ex horted them to do yet was he once almost going to kill himself upon the overthrow of a waggon and the danger his mother was then in of being killed and this on two accounts because of his great concern for her and because he was afraid lest by this de lay the enemy should overtake him in the pursuit but as he was drawing his sword and going to kill himself therewith those that were present restrained him and being so many in num ber were too hard for him and told him that he ought not to desert them and leave them a prey to their enemies for that it was not the part of a brave man to free himself from the dis tresses he was in and to overlook his friends that were in the same distresses also So he was compelled to let that horrid at tempt alone partly out of shame at what they said to him and partly out of regard to the great number of those that would not permit him to do what he intended So he encouraged his mo ther and took all the care of her the time would allow and pro ceeded on the way he proposed to go with the utmost haste and that was to the fortress of Massada And as he had many skir mishes with such of the Parthians as attacked him and pur sued him he was conqueror in them all 9 Nor indeed was he free from the Jews all along as he was in his flight for by the time he had gotten sixty furlongs out of the city and was upon the road they fell upon him and fought hand to hand with him whom he also put to flight and overcame not like one that was in distress and in ne cessity but like one that was excellently prepared for war and had what he wanted in great plenty And in this very place where he overcame the Jews it was that he sometime af terward built a most excellent palace and a city round about it and called it Herodium And when he was come to Idumea at a place called Thressa his brother Joseph met him and he then held a council to take advice about all his affairs and what was fit to be done in his circumstances since he had a great multitude that followed him besides his mercenary soldiers and the place Massada whither he proposed to fly was too small to contain so great a multitude so he sent away the greater part of his company being above nine thousand and bid them go some one way and some another and to save themselves in Idumea and gave them what would buy them provisions in their journey but he took with him those that were the least incumbered and were most intimate with him and came to the fortress and placed there his wives and his followers being Chap XIII ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS SOI eight hundred in number there being in the place a sufficient quantity of corn and water and other necessaries and went di rectly for Petra in Arabia But when it was day the Parthians plundered all Jerusalem and the palace and abstained from nothing but Hyrcanus money which was three hundred ta lents A great deal of Herod s money escaped and principally all that the man had been so provident as to send into Idumea beforehand nor indeed did what was in the city suffice the Parthians but they went out into the country and plundered it and demolished the city Marissa 10 And thus was Antigonus brought back into Judea by the king ot the Parthians and received Hyrcanus and Phasaelus for his prisoners but he was greatly cast down because the women had escaped whom he intended to have given the ene my as having promised they should have them with the money for their reward But being afraid that Hyrcanus who was under the guard of the Parthians might have his kingdom re stored to him by the multitude he cut off his ears and thereby took care that the high priesthood should never come to him any more because he was maimed while the  law required that this dignity should belong to none but such as had all their members entire But now one cannot but here admire the fortitude of Phasaelus who perceiving that he was to be put to death did not think death any terrible thing at all but to die thus by the means of his enemy this he thought a most pitiable and dishon ourable thing and therefore since he had not his hands at li berty but the bonds he was in prevented him from killing himself thereby he dashed his head against a great stone and thereby took away his own life which he thought to be the best thing he could do in such a distress as he was in and there by put it out of the power of the enemy to bring him to any death he pleased It is also reported that when he had made a great wound in his head Antigonus sent physicians to cure it and by ordering them to infuse poison into the wound killed him However Phasaelus hearing before he was quite dead by a cer tain woman that his brother Herod had escaped the enemy underwent his death cheerfully since he now left behind him one who would revenge his death and who was able to inflict mmishment on his enemies  This law of Moses that the priests were to be without blemish as to all the parls of iheir bodies is in Levit xxi 17â 24 302 ANTIO UJTIES OF THE JEWS Book XIV CHAP XIV How Herod got away from the king of Arabia and made haste to go into Egypt and thence went away in haste also to Rome and how by promising a great deal of money to Antony lie obtained of the senate and of Caesar to be made king of the Jews Â 1 A s for Herod the great miseries he was in did not dis courage him but made him sharp in discovering surprising undertakings for he went to Malchus king of Arabia whom he had formerly been very kind to in order to receive somewhat by way of requital now he was in more than ordinary want of it and desired he would let him have some money either by way of loan or as his free gift on account of the many benefits he had received from him for not knowing what was become of his brother he was in haste to redeem him out of the hands of his enemies as willing to give three hundred talents for the price of his redemption He also took with him the son of Phasaelus who was a child of but seven years of age for this very reason that he might be a hostage for the repayment of the money but there came messengers from Malchus to meet him by whom he was desired to be gone for that the Parthians had laid a charge upon him not to entertain Herod This was only a pretence which he made use of that he might not be obliged to repay him what he owed him and this he was farther induced to by the principal men among the Arabians that they might theat him of what sums they had received from his father An tipater and which he had committed to their fidelity He made answer that he did not intend to be troublesome to them by his coming thither but that he desired only to discourse with them about certain affairs that were to him cf the greatest import ance 2 Hereupon he resolved to go away and did go very prudent ly the road to Egypt and then it was that he lodged in a cer tain temple for he had left a great many of his followers there On the next day he came to Rhinocolura and there it was that he heard what was befallen his brother Though Malchus soon re pented of what he had done and came running after Herod but with no manner of success for he was gotten a very great way off and made haste into the road to Pelusium and when the sta tionary ships that lay there hindered him from sailing to Alex andria he wentto their captains by whose assistance and that out of much reverence of and great regard to him he was conducted into the city Alexandria and was retained there by Cleopatra Cluvp XIV ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 303 yet was she not able to prevail with him to stay there because he was making haste to Rome even though the weather was stormy and he was informed that the affairs of Italy were very tumultuous and in great disorder 3 So he set sail from thence to Pamphylia and falling into a violent storm he had much ado to escape to Rhodes with the loss of the ship s burden and there it was that two of his friends Sappinas and Ptolemeus met with him and as he found that city very much damaged in the war against Cassius though he wei e in necessity himself he neglected not to do it a kindness but did what he could to recover it to its former state He also built there a three decked ship and set sail thence with his friends for Italy and came to the port of Brundusium and when he was come from thence to Rome he first related to An tony what had befallen him in Judea and how Phasaelus his brother was seized on by the Parthians and put to death by them and how Hyrcanus was detained captive by them and how they had made Antigonus king who had promised them a sum of money no less than a thousand talents with five hundred wo men who were to be of the principal families and of the Jew ish stock and that he had carried off the women by night and that by undergoing a great many hardships he had escaped the hands of his enemies as also that his own relations were in dan ger of being besieged and taken and that he had sailed through a storm and contemned all these terrible dangers of it in order to come as soon as possible to him who was his hope and only succour at this time 4 This account made Antony commiserate  the change that had happened in Herod s condition and reasoning with himself that this was a common case among those that are placed in such great dignities and that they are liable to the mutations that come from fortune he was very ready to give him the as sistance he desired and this because he called to mind the friend ship he had had with Antipater because Herod offered him mo ney to make him king as he had formerly given it him to make him tetrarch and chiefly because of his hatred to Antigonus for he took him to be a seditious person and an enemy to the Ro mans Caesar was also the forwarder to raise Herod s dignity and to give him his assistance in what he desired on account of the toils of war which he had himself undergone with Antipater his fathei in Egypt and of the hospitality he had treated him  Concerning the chronology of Herod and the time when he was fiW made king at Rome and concerning the time when he began his second reign without a rival upon the conquest and slaughter of Antigonus both principally derived from this and the two next chapters in Joseplms see the note on sect 6 and chap xv Â i t 10 304 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XIV withal and the kindness he had always showed him as also to gratify Antony who was very zealous for Herod So a senate was convocated and Massala first and then Atratinus introduc ed Herod into it and enlarged upon the benefits they had receiv ed from his father and put them in mind of the good will he had borne to the Romans At the same time they accused An tigonus and declared him an enemy not only because of his for mer opposition to them but that he had now overlooked the Ro mans and taken the government from the Parthians Upon this the senate was irritated and Antony informed them farther that it was for their advantage in the Parthian war that Herod should be king This seemed good to all the senators and so they made a decree accordingly 5 And this was the principal instance of Antony s affection for Herod that he not only procured him a kingdom which he did not expect for he did not come with an intention to ask the kingdom for himself which he did not suppose the Romans would grant him who used to bestow it on some of the royal fa mily but intended to desire it for his wife s brother who was grandson by his father to Aristobulus and to Hyrcanus by his mother but that he procured it for him so suddenly that he ob tained what he did not expect and departed out of Italy in so few days as seven in all This young man the grandson He rod afterward took care to have slain as we shall show in its pro per place But when the senate was dissolved Antony and Cae sar went out of the senate house with Herod between them and with the consuls and other magistrates before them in order to offer sacrifices and to lay up their decrees in the capitol An tony also feasted Herod the first day of his reign And thus did this man receive the kingdom having obtained it on the hundred and eighty fourth Olympiad when Caius Domitius Calvinus was consul the second time and Caius Asinius Pollio the first time 6 All this while Antigonus besieged those that were in Mas sada who had plenty of all other necessaries but were only in want  of water insomuch that on this occasion Joseph Herod s brother was contriving to run away from it with two hundred of his dependents to the Arabians for he had heard that Mal chus repented of the offences he had been guilty of with regard to Herod but God by sending rain in the night time prevent ed his going away for their cisterns were thereby filled and he was under no necessity of running away on that account but they were now of good courage and the more so because the sending that plenty of water which they had been in want of seemed a  This grievous want of water at Massada till the place had like to have beea taken by the Parthians mentioned both here and of the War B I chap xv sect 1 vol III is an indication that it was now summer time Chap XV ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 305 mark of divme providence so they made a sally and fought hand to hand with Antigonus soldiers with some openly with some privately and destroyed a great number of them At the same time Ventidius the general of the Romans was sent out of Syria to drive the Parthians out of it and marched after them into Judea in pretence indeed to succour Joseph but in reality the whole affair was no more than a stratagem in order to get money of Antigonus so they pitched their camp very near to Jerusalem and wiped off Antigonus a great deal of money and then he retired himself with the greater part of the army but that the wickedness he had been guilty of might not be found out he left Silo there with a certain part of his soldiers with whom also Antigonus cultivated an acquaintance that he might cause him no disturbance and was still in hopes that the Parthians would come again and defend him CHAP XV Haw Herod sailed out of Italy to Judea and fought with An tigonus and what other things happened in Judea about that time Â 1 BY this time Herod had sailed out of Italy to Pto lemais and had gotten together no small army both of strang ers and of his own countrymen and marched through Galilee against Antigonus Silo also and Ventidius came and assisted him being persuaded by Dellius who was sent by Antony to assist in bringing back Herod Now for Ventidius he was em ployed in composing the disturbances that had been made hi the cities by the means of the Parthians and for Silo he was in Ju dea indeed but corrupted by Antigonus However as Herod went along his army increased every day and all Galilee with some small exception joined him but as he was marching to those that were at Massada for he was obliged to endeavour to save those that were in that fortress now they were besieged because they were his relations Joppa was a hinderance to him for it was necessary for him to take that place first it being a city at variance with him that no strong hold might be left in his enemies hands behind him when he should go to Jerusalem and when Silo made this a pretence for rising up from Jerusalem and was thereupon pursued by the Jews Herod fell upon them with a small body of men and both put the Jews to flight and saved Silo when he was very poorly able to defend himself but when Herod had taken Joppa he made haste to set free those of his family that were in Massada Now of the people of the coun try some joined him because of the friendship they had had with 306 ANTIQUITIES OV THE JEWS Book XIV his father and some because of the splendid appearance he made  and others by way of requital for the benefits they had received from both of them but the greatest number came to him in hopes of getting somewhat from him afterward if he were once firmly settled in the kingdom 2 Herod had now a strong army and as he marched on An tigonus laid snares and ambushes in the passes and places most proper for them but in truth he thereby did little or no damage to the enemy so Herod received those of his family out of Massada and the fortress Ressa and then went on for Jeru salem The soldiery also that was with Silo accompanied him all along as did many of the citizens being afraid of his power and as soon as he had pitched his camp on the west side of the city the soldiers that were set to guard that part shot their ar rows and threw their darts at him and when some sallied out in a crowd and came to fight hand to hand with the first ranks of Herod s army he gave orders that they should in the first place make proclamation about the wall That he came for the good of the people and for the preservation of the city and not to bear any old grudge at even his most open enemies but ready to forget the offences which his greatest adversaries had done him But Antigonus by way of reply to what Herod had caused to be proclaimed and this before the Romans and before Silo also said That they would not do justly if they gave the kingdom to Herod who was no more than 1 private man and an Idumean i e  a half Jew whereas they ought to bestow it on one of the royal family as their custom was for that in case they at present bare an ill will to him and had resolved to deprive him of the kingdom as having received it from the Parthians yet were there many others of his family that might by their law take it and these such as had no way offended the Romans and being of the sa cerdotal family it would be an unworthy thing to put them by Now while they said thus one to another and fell to reproaching one another on both sides Antigonus permitted his own men that were upon the wall to defend themselves who using their bows and showing great alacrity against their ene mies easily drove them away from the towers  Tliis affirmation of Antigonus spoken in the days of Herod and in a manner to his face tlmt he was an Idumean i e a half Jew seems to me of much gieatei authority than that pretence of his favourite and flatterer Nicolaus of Damascus that he derived his pedigree from Jews as far backward as the Babylonish captivity ch i sect 3 Accordingly Josephus always esteems him an Idumean though he says his father Antipater was of the sarce people with the Jews ch viii sect I and by birth a Jew Antip B XX ch viii sect 7 as indeed all such proselytes of Justice at thÂ Idumeans were in time esteemed the very same people as the Jews Chap XV  ANTIQUITIES OI THE JEWS 307 3 And now it was that Silo discovered that he had taken bribes for he set a good number of his soldiers to complain aloud of want of provisions they were in and to require money to buy them food and that it was fit to let them go into places proper for winter quarters since the places near the city were a desert by reason that Antigonus soldiers had carried all away so he set the army upon removing and endeavoured to march away But Herod pressed Silo not to depart and ex horted Silo s captains and soldiers not to desert him when Cae sar and Antony and the senate had sent him thither for that he would provide them plenty of all the things they wanted and easily procure them a great abundance of what they re quired after which entreaty he immediately went out into the country and left not the least pretence to Silo for his de parture for he brought an unexpected quantity of provisions and sent to those friends of his who inhabited about Samaria to bring down corn and wine and oil and cattle and all other provisions to Jericho thnt there might be no want of a supply for the soldiers for the time to come Antigonus was sensible of this and sent presently over the country such as might re strain and lie in ambush for those that went out for provisions So these men obeyed the orders of Antigonus and got together a great number of armed men about Jericho and sat upon the mountains and watched those that brought the provisions How ever Herod was not idle in the meantime for he took ten bands of soldiers of whom five were of the Romans and five of the Jews with some mercenaries among them and with some few horsemen and came to Jericho and as they found the city deserted but that five hundred of them had settled themselves on the tops of the hills with their wives and children those he took and sent away but the Romans fell upon the city and plundered it andfound the houses full of all sorts of good things So the king left a garrison at Jericho and came back again and sent the Roman army to take their winter quarters in the coun tries that were come over to him Judea and Galilee and Sa maria And so much did Antigonus gain of Silo for the bribes he gave him that part of the army should be quartered at Lid da in order to please Antony So the Romans laid their wea pons aside and lived in plenty of all things 4 But Herod was not pleased with lying still but sent out his brother Joseph against Idumea with two thousand armed footmen and four hundred horsemen while he himself came to Samaria and left his mother and his other relations there for they were already gone out of Massada and went into Galilee to take certain places which were held by the garrisons ot Anti gonus and he passed on to Senphoris as God sent a snow while VOL II Q Q 26 508 ANTlgUITJES OF THE JEWS Book XIV Antigonus garrisons withdrew themselves and had great plenty of provisions He also went thence and resolved to destroy those robbers that dwelt in the caves and did much mischief in the country so he sent a troop of horsemen and three compa nies of armed footmen against them They were very neflr to a village called Arbela and on the fortieth day after he came himself with his whole army and as the enemy sallied out boldly upon him the left wing of his army gave way but he appearing with a body of men put those to flight who wei e al ready conquerors and recalled his men that ran away He al so pressed upon his enemies and pursued them as far as the river Jordan though they ran away by different roads So he Drought over to him all Galilee excepting those that dwelt in the caves and distributed money to every one of his soldiers giving them a hundred and fifty drachmae a piece and much more to their captains and sent them into winter quarters at which time Silo came to him and his commanders with him because Antigonus would not give him provisions any longer for he supplied them for no more than one month nay he had sent to all the country about and ordered them to carry off the provisions that were there and retire to the mountains that the Romans might have no provisions to live upon and so might perish by famine but Herod committed the care of that mat ter to Pheroras his youngest brother and ordered him to re pair Alexandrium also Accordingly he quickly made the sol diers abound with great plenty of provisions and rebuilt Alex andrium which had been before desolate 5 About this time it was that Antony continued some time at Athens and that Ventidius who was now in Syria sent for Silo and commanded him to assist Herod in the first place to finish the present war and then to send for their confederates for the war they were themselves engaged in  but as for Herod he went in haste against the robbers that were in the caves and sent Silo away to Ventidius while he marched against them These caves were in mountains that were exceeding abrupt and in their middle were no other than precipices with certain en trances into the caves and those caves were encompassed with sharp rocks and in these did the robbers lie concealed with all their families about them but the king caused certain chests to be made in order to destroy them and to be hung down bound about with iron chains by an engine from the top of the moun tain it being not possible to get up to them by reason of the sharp ascent of the mountains nor to creep down to them from above Now these chests were filled with armed men whohadlong hooks in their hands by which they might pull out such as re sisted them and then tumble them down and kill them by so Chap XV ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 309 doing but the letting the chest down proved to be a matter of great danger because of the vast depth they were to be let down although they had their provisions in the chests themselves but when the chests were let down and not one of those in the mouths of the caves durst come rear them but lay still out ot fear some of the armed men girt on their armour and by both their hands took h Id of the chain by which the chests were let down and went in o the moutl s of the caves because they fretted that such c ehiy w s made by the robbers not daring to come out of the caves and when they were at any of those mouths they first killed many of those that were in the mouths with their darts and afterwards pulled those to them that resisted them with their hooks and tumbled them down the precipices and afterwards went into the caves and killed many more and then went into their chests again and lay still there but upon this terror seized the rest when they heard the lamentations that were made and they despaired of escaping however when the night came on that put an end to the whole work and as the king proclaimed pardon by a herald to such as delivered themselves up to him many accepted of the offer The same method of assault was made use of the next day and they went farther and got out in baskets to fight them and sought them at their doors and sent fire among them and set their caves on fire for there was a great deal of combustible matter within them Now there was one old man who was caught within one of these caves with seven children and a wife these prayed him to give them leave to go out and yield themselves up to the ene my but he stood at the cave s mouth and always slew that child of his who went out till he had destroyed them every one and after that he slew his wife and cast their dead bodies down the precipice and himself after them and so underwent death rather than slavery but before he did this he greatly reproach ed Herod with the meanness of his family although he was then king Herod also saw what he was doing and stretched out his hand and offered him all manner of security for his life By which means all these caves were at length subdued entirely 6 And when the king had set Ptolemy over these parts of the country as his general he went to Samaria with six hun dred horsemen and three thousand armed footmen as intend ing to fight Antigonus But still this command of the army did not succeed well with Ptolemy but those that had been trouble some to Galilee before attacked him and slew him and when they had done this they fled among the lakes and places al most inaccessible laying waste and plundering whatsoever they could come at in those places But Herod soon returned and punished them for what they had done for some of these re 310 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XIV bels he slew and others of them who had fled to the strong holds he besieged and both slew them and demolished their strongholds and when he had thus put an end to their re bellion he laid a fine upon the cities of a hundred talents 7 In the meantime Pacorus was fallen in a battle and the Parthians were defeated When Ventidius sent Macherus to the assistance of Herod with two legions and a thousand horsemen while Antony encouraged him to make haste But Macherus at the instigation of Antigonus without the approbation of He rod as being corrupted by money went about to take a view of his affairs but Antigonus suspecting this intention of his coming did not admit him into the city but kept him at a distance with throwing stones at him and plainly showed what he himself meant But when Macherus was sensible that Herod had given him good advice and that he had made a mistake hinuelf in not hearkening to the advice he retired to the city Emmaus and what Jews he met with he slew them whether they were ene mies or friends out of the rage he was in at what hardships he had undergone The king was provoked at this conduct of his and went to Samaria and resolved to go to Antony about these affairs and to inform him that he stood in no need of such helpers who did him more mischief than they did his enemies and that he was able of himself to beat Antigonus but Macherhs followed him and desired that he would not go to Antony or if he was resolved to go that he would join his brother Jo seph with them and let them fight against Antigonus So he was reconciled to Macherus upon his earnest entreaties Ac cordingly he left Joseph there with his army but charged him to run no hazards nor to quarrel with Macherus 8 But for his own part he made haste to Antony who was then at the siege of Samosata a place upon Euphrates with his troops both horsemen and footmen to be auxiliaries to him and when he came to Antioch and met there a great number of men gotten together that were very desirous to go to Antony but durst not venture to go out of fear because the Barba rians fell upon men on the road and slew many so he encour aged them and became their conductor upon the road Now when they were within two days march of Samosata the Barba rians had laid an ambush there to disturb those that came to An tony and there the woods made the passes narrow as they led to the plains where they laid not a few of their horsemen who were to lie still until those passengers were gone by into the wide place Now as soon as their first ranks were gone by for He rod brought on the rear those that lay in ambush who were about five hundred fell upon them on the sudden and when they had put the foremost to flight the king came riding hard with Chap XV ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 311 the forces that were about him and immediately drove back the enemy by which means he made the minds of his own men courageous and emboldened Intern to go on insomuch that those who ran away before now returned back and the Barbarians were slain on all sides The king also went on killing them and recovered all the baggage among which were a great number of beasts for burden and of slaves and proceeded on in his march and whereas there were a very great number of those in the woods that attacked them and were near the passage that letl into the plain he made a sally upon these also with a strong body of men and put them to flight and slew many of them and thereby rendered the way safe for those that came after and these called Herod their saviour and protector 9 And when he was near to Samosata Antony sent out his army in all their proper habiliments to meet him in order to pay Herod this respect and because of the assistance he had given him for he had heard what attacks the Barbarians had made upon him in Judea He also was very glad to see him there as having been made acquainted with the great actions he had performed upon the road so he entertained him very kindly and could not but admire his courage Antony also embraced him as soon as he saw him and saluted him after a most affection ate manner and gave him the upper hand as having himself late ly made him a king and in a little time Antiochus delivered up the fortress and on that account this war was at an end then Antony committed the rest to Sosius and gave him orders to assist Herod and went himself to Egypt Accordingly Sosius sent two legions before into Judea to the assistance of Herod and he followed himself with the body of the army 10 Now Joseph was already slain in Judea in the manner following He forgot what charge his brother Herod had given him when he went to Antony and when he had pitched his camp among the mountains for Macherus had lent him five regiments with these he went hastily to Jericho in order to reap the corn thereto belonging and as the Roman regiments were but newly raised and were unskilful in war for they were in great part collected out of Syria he was attacked by the ene my and caught in those places of difficulty and was himself slain as he was fighting bravely and the whole army was lost for there were six regiments slain So when Antigonus had got possession of the dead bodies he cut off Joseph s head although Pheroras his brother would have redeemed it at the price of fifty talents After which defeat the Galileans revolted from their commanders and took those of Herod s party and drowned them in the lake and a great part of Judea was become sedi tious but Macherus fortified the place Gitta in Samaria 812 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XIV 11 At this time messengers came to Herod and informed him of what had been done and whÂ n he was come to Daphne by Antioch they told him of the ill fortune that had befallen his brother which yet he expected from certain visions that ap peared to him in his dreams which clearly foreshowed his bro ther s death So he hastened his march and when he came to mount Libanus he received about eight hundred of the men of that place having already with him also one Roman legion and with these he came to Ptolemais He also marched thence by night with his army and proceeded along Galilee Here it was that the enemy met him and fought him and were beaten and shut up in the same place of strength whence they had sallied out the day before So he attacked the place in the morning but by reason of a great storm that was then very violent he was able to do nothing but drew off his army into the neighbouring vil lages yet as soon as the other legion that Antony sent him was come to his assistance those that were in garrison in the place were afraid and deserted it in the night time Then did the king march hastily to Jericho intending to avenge himself on the enemy for the slaughter of his brother and when he had pitched his tents he made a feast for the principal commanders and after this collation was over and he had dismissed his guests he retired to his own chamber and here may one see what kind ness God had for the king for the upper part of the house fell down when nobody was in it and so killed none insomuch that all the people believed that Herod was beloved of God since he had escaped such a great and surprising danger 12 But the next day six thousand ot the enemy came down from the tops of the mountains to fight the Romans which great ly terrified them and the soldiers that were in light armour came near and pelted the king s guards that were come out with darts and stones and one of them hit him on the side with a dart Antigonus also sent a commander against Samaria whose name was Pappus with some forces being desirous to show the enemy how potent he was and that he had men to spare in his war with them He sat down to oppose Macherus but He rod when he had taken five cities took such as were left in them being about two thousand and slew them and burnt the cities themselves and then returned to go against Pappus who was encamped at a village called Isanas and there ran in to him many out of Jericho and Judea near to which places he was and the enemy fell upon his men so stout were they at this time and joined battle with them but he beat them in the fight and in order to be revenged on them for the slaughter of his brother he pursued them sharply and killed them as they raÂ Chap XV ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 313 away  and as the houses were full of armed men and many of them ran as far as the tops of the houses he got them under his power and pulled down the roofs of the houses and saw the lower rooms full of soldiers that were caught and lay all on a heap so they threw stones down upon them as they lay piled one upon another and thereby killed them nor was there a more frightful spectacle in all the war than this where beyond the walls an immense multitude of dead men lay heaped one up on another This action it was which chiefly broke the spirits of the enemy who expected now what would come for there appeared a mighty number of people that came from places far distant that were now about the village but then ran away and had it not been for the depth of winter which then re strained them the king s army had presently gone to Jerusalem as being very courageous at this good success and the whole work had been done immediately for Antigonus was already looking about how he might fly away and leave the city 13 At this time the king gave order that the soldiers should go to supper for it was late at night while he went into a chamber to use the bath for he was very weary and here it was that he was in the greatest danger which yet by God s providence he escaped for as he was naked and had but one servant that followed him to be with him while he was bathing in an inner room certain of the enemy who were in their ar mour and had fled thither out of fear were then in the place and as he was bathing the first of them came out with his na ked sword drawn and went out at the doors and after him a second and third armed in like manner and were under such a consternation that they did no hurt to the king and thought themselves to have come off7 very well in suffering no harm themselves in their getting out of the house However on the next day he cut oft the head of Pappus for he was already slain and sent it to Pheroras as a punishment of what their brother had suffered by his means for he was the man that slew him with his own hand 14 When the rigour of winter was over Herod removed his army and came near to Jerusalem and pitched his camp hard by the city Now this was the third year since he had been made king at Rome and as he removed his camp and came near that part of the wall where it could be most easily assaulted  It may be worth our observation here that these soldiers of Herod s could not have gotten upon the tops of these houses which were full of enemies in or der to pull up the upper floors and destroy them beneath but on ladders from the outside which illustrates some texts in the New Testament by which it ap pears that men used to ascend thither by ladders on the euuides See Mai t xxiv 17 Mark xiii 15 Luke v 13 xvii 31 81 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XIV he pitched that camp before the temple intending to make his attacks in the same manner as did Pompey so he encompassed the place with three bulwarks and erected towers and em ployed a great many hands about the work and cut down the trees that were round about the city and when he had ap pointed proper persons to oversee the works even while the army lay before the city he himself went to Samaria to com plete his marriage and to take to wife the daughter of Alex ander the son of Aristobulus for he had betrothed her already as I have before related CHAP XVI How Herod when he had man led Mariamne took Jerusalem with the assistance of Sosius by force and how the govern ment of the Asamoneans was put an end to Â 1 AFTER the wedding was over came Sosius through Phenicia having sent out his army before him over the mid land parts He also who was their commander came him self with a great number of horsemen and footmen The king also came himself from Samaria and brought with him no small army besides that which was there before for they were about thirty thousand and they all met together at the walls of Jerusalem and encamped at the north wall of the city being now an army of eleven legions armed men on foot and six thousand horsemen with other auxiliaries out of Syria The generals were two Sosius sent by Antony to assist Herod and Herod on his own account in order to take the government from Antigonus who was declared an enemy at Rome and that he might himself be king according to the decree of the senate 2 Now the Jews that were inclosed within the walls of the city fought against Herod with great alacrity and zeal for the whole nation was gathered together they also gave out many prophecies about the temple and many things agreeable to the people as if God would deliver them out of the dangers they were in they had also carried off what was out of the city that they might not leave any thing to afford sustenance either for men or lor beasts and by private robberies they made the want of ne cessaries greater When Herod understood this he opposed am bushes in the fittest places against their private robberies and he sent legions of armed men to bring in provisions and that from remote places so that in a little time they had great plenty of pro visions Now the three bulwarks were easily erected because so many hands were continually at work upon them for it was sum mer time and there was nothing to hinder them in raising the r Chap XVI ANTiyurriES OF THE JEWS 315 works neither from the air nor from the workmen so they brought their engines to bear and shook the walls of the citv and tried all manner of ways to get in yet did not these with in discover any fear but they also contrived not a few engines to oppose their engines withal They also sallied out and burnt not only those engines that were not yet perfected but those that were and when they came hand to hand their attempts were not less bold than those of the Romans though they were behind them in skill They also erected new works when the former were ruined and making mines underground they met each other and fought there and making useof brutish con rage rather than of prudent valour they persisted in this war to the very last and this they did while a mighty army lay round about them and while they were distressed by famine and the want of neces saries for this happened to be a sabbatic year The first that scaled the walls were twenty chosen men the next were Sosius centurions for the first wall was taken in forty days and the se cond in fifteen more when some of the cloisters that were about the temple were burnt which Herod gave out to have been burnt by Antigonus in order to expose him to the hatred of the Jews And when the outer court of the temple and the lower city were taken the Jews fled into the inner court of the temple and into the upper city but now fearing lest the Romans should hinder them from offering their daily sacrifices to God they sent an cm bassage and desired that they would only permit them to bring in beasts for sacrifices which Herod granted hoping they were going to yield but when he saw that they did nothing of what he supposed but bitterly opposed him in order to preserve the kingdom to Antigonus he made an assault upon the city and took it by storm and now all parts were full of those that were slain by the rage of the Romans at the long duration of the siege and by the zeal of the Jews that were on Herod s side who were not willing to leave one of their adversaries alive so they were murdered continually in the narrow streets and in the houses by crowds and as they were flying to the temple for shelter and there was no pity taken of either infants or the aged nor did they spare so much as the weaker sex nay although the king sent about and besought them to spare the people yet nobody restrained their hand from slaughter but as if they were a com pany of madmen they fell upon persons of all ages without dis tinction and then Antigonus without regard to either his past or present circumstances came down from the citadel and fell down at the feet of Sosius who took no pity of him in the change of his fortune but insulted him beyond measure and called him Antigone _i c a woman and not a man yet did VOL u R K 25 316 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XIV he not treat him as if he were a woman by letting him go at liberty but put him into bonds and kept him in close custody 3 And now Herod having overcome his enemies his care was to govern those foreigners who had been his assistants for the crowd of strangers rushed to see the temple and the sacred things in the temple but the king thinking a victory to be a more se vere affliction than a defeat if any of those things which it was not lawful to see should be seen by them used entreaties and threatenings and even sometimes force itself to restrain them He also prohibited the ravage that was made in the city and many times asked Sosius whether the Romans would empty the city both of money and men and leave him king of a desert and told him that he esteemed the dominion over the whole habit able earth as by no means an equivalent satisfaction for such a murder of his citizens and when he said that this plunder was iustly to be permitted the soldiers for the siege they had under gone he replied that he would give every one their reward out of his own money and by this means he redeemed what remain ed of the city from destruction and he performed what he had promised him for he gave a noble present to every soldier and a proportionable present to their commanders but a most royal present to Sosius himself till they all went away full of money 4 This  destruction befell the city of Jerusalem when Marcus Agrippa and Caninius Gallus were consuls of Rome on the hundred eighty and fifth Olympiad on the third month on the  Note here that Josephus fully and frequently assures us that there passed above three years between Herod s first obtaining the kingdom at Rome and his second obtaining it upon the taking of Jerusalem and death of Antigonus The present history of this interval twice mentions the army s going into winter quarters which perhaps belonged to two several winters ch xv sect 3 4 and though Josephus says nothing how long they lay in those quarters yet does he give such an account of the long and studied delays of Ventidius Silo and Macherus who were to see Herod settled in his new kingdom but seem not to have had sufficient forces for that pur pose and were for certain all corrupted by Antigonus to make the longest delays possible and give us such particular accounts of the many great actions of Herod s during the same interval as fairly imply that interval before Herod went to Samo sata to have been very considerable However what is wanting in Josephus is ful ly supplied by Moses Chorenensis the Armenian historian in his history of that interval B II ch xviii where he directly assures us that Tigranes then king of Armenia and the principal manager of this Parthian war reigned two years after Herod was made king at Rome and yet Antony did not hear of his death in that very neighbourhood at Samosata till he was come thither to besiege it after which Herod brought him an army which was 340 miles march and through a difficult country full of enemies also and joined with him in the siege of Samosata till that city was taken then Herod and Sosius march back with their large armies the seme number of 540 miles and when in a little time they sat down to besiege Jerusalem they were not able to take it but by a siege of five months All which put together fulty supplies what is wanting in Josephus and secures the entire chronology ol these times beyond contradiction Chap XVI ANTIQUITIES OK THE JEWS 317 solemnity of the fast as if n periodical revolution of calamities had returned since that which befell the Jews under Pompey for the Jews were taken by him on the same day and this was after twenty seven years time So when Sosius had dedicated a crown of gold to God he marched away from Jerusalem and carried Antigonus with him in bonds to Antony but Herod was afraid lest Antigonus should be kept in prison only by Antony and that when he was carried to Rome by him he might get his cause to be heard by the senate and might demonstrate as he was himself of the royal blood and Herod but a private man that therefore it belonged to his sons however to have the king dom on account of the family they were of in case he had him self offended the Romans by what he had done Out of Herod s fear of this it was that he by giving Antony a great deal of money endeavoured to persuade him to have Antigonus slain which if it were once done he should be free from that fear And thus did the government of the Asamoneans cease a hundred twenty and six years after it was first set up This family was a splendid and an illustrious one both on account of the nobility of their stock and of the dignity of the high priesthood as also for the glorious actions their ancestors had performed for our nation but these men lost the government by their dissentions one with another and it came to Herod the son of Antipater who was of no more than a vulgar family and of no eminent extraction but one that was subject to other kings and this is what history tells us was the end of the Asamonean family 318 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book X V  BOOK XV CONTAINING THE INTERVAL OF EIGHTEEN YEARS FROM THE DEATH OF ANTIGONUS TO THE FINISHING OF THE TEMPLE BY HEROD CHAP I Concerning Pollio and Sameas Herod slays the principal of Antigonus friends and spoils the city of its wealth Antony beheads Antigonus Â 1 H ow Sosius and Herod took Jerusalem by force and besides that how they took Antigonus captive has been related by us in the foregoing book We will now proceed in the nar ration And since Herod had now the government of all Judea put into his hands he promoted such of the private men in the city as had been of his party but never left off avenging and punishing every day those that had chosen to be of the party of his enemies But Pollio the Pharisee and Sameas a disciple of his were honoured by him above all the rest for when Jerusa lem was besieged they advised the citizens to receive Herod for which advice they were well requited but this Pollio at the time when Herod was once upon his trial of life and death foretold in way of reproach to Hyrcanus and the other judges how this Herod whom they suffered now to escape would after ward inflict punishment on them all which had its completion in tune while God fulfilled the words he had spoken 2 At this time Herod now he had got Jerusalem under his power carried off all the royal ornaments and spoiled the weal thy men of what they had gotten and when by these means he had heaped together a great quantity of silver and gold he gave it all to Antony and his friends that were about him He also slew forty five of the principal men of Antigonus party and set guards at the gates of the city that nothing might be carried out together with their dead bodies They also searched the dead and whatsoever was found either of silver or gold or other treasure it was carried to the king nor was there any end of the miseries he brought upon them and this distress was in part occasioned by the covetousness of the prince regent who was still in want of more and in part by the sabbatic year which Chap II ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 319 was still going on and forced the country to lie still uncultivated since we are forbidden to sow our land in that year Now when Antony had received Antigonus as his captive he determined to keep him against his triumph but when he heard that the na tion grew seditious and that out of their hatred to Herod they continued to bear good will to Antigonus he resolved to behead him at Antioch for otherwise the Jews could no way be brought to be quiet And Strabo of Cappadocia attests to what I have said when he thus speaks Antony ordered An tigonus the Jew to be brought to Antioch and there to be beheaded And this Antony seems to me to have been the very first man who beheaded a king as supposing he could no other way bend the minds of the Jews so as to receive He rod whom he had made king in his stead for by no torments could they be forced to call him king so great a fondness they had for their former king so he thought that this dis honourable death would diminish the value they had for An tigonus memory and at the same time would diminish their hatred they bare to Herod Thus far Strabo CHAP II Hem Hyrcanus was set at liberty by the Parthians and returned to Herod and what Alexandra did when she heard that Ana nelus was made high priest  1 N ow after Herod was in possession of the kingdom Hyrcanus the high priest who was then a captive among the Parthians came to him again and was set free from his captivi ty in the manner following Barzapharnes and Pocorus the generals of the Parthians took Hyrcanus who was first made high priest and afterward king and Herod s brother Phasaelus captives and were carrying them away into Parthia Phasaelus indeed could not bear the reproach of being in bonds and think ing that death with glory was better than any life whatsoever he became his own executioner as I have formerly related 2 But when Hyrcanus was brought into Parthia the king Phraates treated him after a very gentle manner as having al ready learned of what an illustrious family he was on which account he set him free from his bonds and gave him a habi tation at  Babylon where there was Jews in great numbers  The city here called Babylon by Josephus seems to be one which was built by some of the Seleucidse upon the Tigris which long after the utter destruction of old Babylon was commonly so called and I suppose not far from Seleucia just as the latter adjoining city Bngdat lias been and is often called by the came old name of Babylon till this very day 320 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XV These Jews honoured Hyrcanus as their high priest and king as did all the Jewish nation that dwelt as far as Euphrates which respect was very much to his satisfaction But when he was informed that Herod had received the kingdom new hopes came upon him as having been himself still of a kind disposition towards him and expecting that Herod would bear in mind what favour he had received from him and when he was upon his trial and when he was in danger that a capital sentence would be pronounced against him he delivered him from that danger and from all punishment Accordingly he talked of that matter with the Jews that came often to him with great affection but they endeavoured to retain him among them and desired that he would stay with them putting him in mind of the kind offices and honours they did him and that those honours they paid him were not at all inferior to what they could pay to either their high priests or their kings and what was a greater motive to deter mine him they said was this that he could not have those dig nities in Judea because of that maim in his body which had been inflicted on him by Antigonus and that kings do not use to requite men for those kindnesses which they received when they were private persons the height of their fortune making usually no small changes in them 3 Now although they suggested these arguments to him for his own advantage yet did Hyrcanus still desire to depart He rod also wrote to him and persuaded him to desire of Phraates and the Jews that were there that they should not grudge him the royal authority which he should have jointly with himself for that now was the proper time for himself to make him amends for the favours he had received from him as having been brought up by him and saved by him also as well as for Hyrcanus to receive it And as he wrote thus to Hyrcanus so did he send also Saramallas his ambassador to Phraates and many presents with him and desired him in the most obliging way that he would be no hinderance to his gratitude towards his benefactor But this zeal of Herod s did not flow from that principle but because he had been made governor of that country without hav ing any just claim to it he was afraid and that upon reasons good enough of a change in his condition and so made what haste he could to get Hyrcanus into his power or indeed to put him quite out of the way which last thing he compassed afterward 4 Accordingly when Hyrcanus came full of assurance by the permission of the king of Parthia and at the expense of the Jews who supplied him with money Herod received him with all possible respect and gave him the upper place at public meet ings and set him above all the rest at feasts and thereby deceived him He called him his father and endeavoured by all the Chap II ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 321 ways possible that he might have no suspicion of any treach erous design against him He also did other things in order to secure his government which yet occasioned a sedition in his own family for being cautious how he made any  illustrious person the high priest of God he sent for an obscure priest out of Babylon whose name was Ananelus and bestowed the higty priesthood upon him 5 However Alexandra the daughter of Hyrcanus and wife of Alexander the son of Aristobulus the king who had also brought Alexander two children could not bear this indig nity Now this son was one of the greatest comeliness and was called Aristobulus and the daughter Mariamne was married to Herod and eminent for her beauty also This Alexandra was much disturbed and took this indignity offered to her son exceeding ill that while he was alive any one else should be sent for to have the dignity of the high priesthood conferred upon him Accordingly she wrote to Cleopatra a musician assisting her in taking care to have her letters carried to desire her in tercession with Antony in order to gain the high priesthood for her son 6 But as Antony was slow in granting this request his friend f Dellius came into Judea upon some affairs and when he saw Aristobulus he stood in admiration at the tallness and hand someness of the child and no less at Mariamne the king s wife and was open in his commendations of Alexandra as the mo ther of most beautiful children And when she came to discourse with him he persuaded her to get pictures drawn of them both and to send them to Antony for that when he saw them he would deny her nothing that she should ask Accordingly Alex andra was elevated with these words of his and sent the pictures to Antony Dellius also talked extravagantly and said That these children seemed not derived from men but from some god or other His design in doing so was to entice Antony into lewd pleasures with them who was ashamed to send for  Here we have an eminent example of Herod s worldly and profane politics when by the abuse of his unlawful and usurped power to make whom he pleased high priest in the person of Ananelus he occasioned such disturbances in his king dom and his own family as suffered him to enjoy no lasting peace or tranquillity ever afterward and such is frequently the effect of profane court politics about mat ters of religion in other ages and nations The Old Testament is full of the mis eries the people of the Jews derived from such court politics especially in and af ter the days of Jeroboam the son of Nebat who made Israel to sin who gave the most pernicious example of it who brought on the grossest corruption of religion by it and the punishment of whose family for it was most remarkable The cat e is too well known to stand in need of particular citations t Of this wicked Dellius sec the note on the War B I ch xv sect 3 vol 111 822 ANTIQUITIES OP THE JKWS Book XV the damsel as being the wife of Herod and avoided it because of the reproaches he should have from Cleopatra on that account but he sent in the most decent manner he could for the young man but added this withal Unless he thought it hard upon him so to do When this letter was brought to Herod he did not think it safe for him to send one so handsome as was Aristobulus in the prime of his life for he was sixteen years of age and of so noble a family and particularly not to Antony the principal man among the Romans and one that would abuse him in his amours and besides one that openly indulged him self in such pleasures as his power allowed him without con trol He therefore wrote back to him That if this boy should only go out of the country all would be in a state of war and uproar because the Jews were in hopes of a change in the government and to have another king over them 7 When Herod had thus excused himself to Antony he re solved that he would not entirely permit the child or Alexan dra to be treated dishonourably but his wife Mariamne lay ve hemently at him to restore the high priesthood to her brother and he judged it was for his advantage so to do because if he once had that dignity he could not go out of the country So he called his friends together and told them That  Alexandra privately conspired against his royal authority and endea voured by the means of Cleopatra so to bring it about that he might be deprived of the government and that by An tony s means this youth might have the management of public affairs in his stead and that this procedure of hers was un just since she would at the same time deprive her daughter of the dignity she now had and would bring disturbances up on the kingdom for which he had taken a great deal of pains and had gotten it with extraordinary hazards that yet while he well remembered her wicked practices he would not leave off doing what was right himself but would even now give the youth the high priesthood and that he for merly set up Ananelus because Aristobulus was then so very young a child Now when he had said this not at random but as he thought with the best discretion he had in order to deceive the women and those friends whom he had taken to consult withal Alexandra out of the great joy she had at this unexpected promise and out of fear from the sus picions she lay under fell a weeping and made the following apology for herself and said That as to the high priest hood she was very much concerned for the disgrace her son was under and so did her utmost endeavours to procure it for him but that as to the kingdom she had made no attempts and that if it were offered her for her son she would not Chap III ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 323 accept it and that now she would be satisfied with her son s dignity while he himself held the civil government and she had thereby the security that arose from his peculiar ability in governing to all the remainder of her family that she was now overcome by his benefits and thankfully accepted of this honour showed by him to her son and that she would hereafter be entirely obedient and she desired him to excuse her if the nobility of her family and that freedom of acting which she thought that allowed her had made her act too precipitately and imprudently in this matter So when they had spoken thus to one another they came to an agreement and all suspicions so far as appeared were vanished away CHAP III Hcno Herod upon his making Aristobulus high priest took care that he should be murdered in a little time and vohqt apology he made to Antony about Aristobulus as also concerning Jo seph and Mariamne  1 oo king Herod immediately took the high priesthood away from Ananelus who as we said before was not of this country but one of those Jews that had been carried captive beyond Euphrates for there were not a few ten thousands of this people that had been carried captives and dwelt about Babylonia whence Ananelus came He was one  of the stock of the high priests and had been of old a particular friend of Herod s and when he was first made king he conferred that dignity upon him and now put him out of it again in order to quiet the troubles in his family though what he did was plainly unlawful for at no other time of old was any one that had once been in that dignity deprived of it It was Antiochus Epiphanes who first broke that law and deprived Jesus and made his bro ther Onias high priest in his stead Aristobulus was the second that did so and took that dignity from his brother Hyrcanus   When Josephus says here that this Ananelus the new high priest was of the slack of the high priests and since he had been just telling us that he was a priest of an obscure family or character ch ii sect  4 it is not at all probable that he could so soon say that he was of the stock tf the high priests However Josephus here makes a remarkable observation that this Ananelus was the third that was very unjustly and wickedly turned out of the high priesthood by the civil power no king or gov ernor having ventured to do so that Josephus knew of but that heathen tyrant and persecutor Antiochus Epiphanes that barbarous parricide Aristobulus the first that took royal authority among the Maccabees and this tyrant king Herod the Great although afterward that infamous practice became frequent till the very destruction of Jerusalem when the office of high priesthood was at an end VOL iI s s 25 324 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book X V and this Herod was the third who took that high office away from Ananelus and gave it to this young man Aristobulus in his stead 2 And now Herod seemed to have healed the divisions in his family yet was he not without suspicion as is frequently the case of people seeming to be reconciled to one another but thought that as Alexandra had already made attempts tending to innovations so did he fear that she would go on therein if she found a fit opportunity for so doing so he gave a command that she should dwell in the palace and meddle with no public affairs her guards also were so careful that nothing she did in private life every day was concealed All these hardships put her out of patience by little and little and she began to hate Herod for as she had the pride of a woman to the utmost de gree she had great indignation at this suspicious guard that was about her as desirous rather to undergo any thing that could be fall her than to be deprived of her liberty of speech and under the notion of an honorary guard to live in a state of slavery and terror She therefore sent to Cleopatra and made a long complaint of the circumstances she was in and entreated her to do her utmost for her assistance Cleopatra hereupon advised her to take her son with her and come away immediately to her into Egypt This advice pleased her and she had this contri vance for getting away she got two coffins made as if they were to carry away two dead bodies and put herself into one and her son into the other and gave orders to such of her servants as knew of her intentions to carry them away in the night time Now their road was to be thence to the seaside and there was a ship ready to carry them into Egypt Now JEsop one of her servants happened to fall upon Sabion one of her friends and spake of this matter to him as thinking he had known of it before When Sabion knew this who had for merly been an enemy of Herod s and been esteemed one of those that laid snares for and gave the poison to his father Antipa ter he expected that this discovery would change Herod s hatred into kindness so he told the king of this private strata gem of Alexandra s Whereupon he suffered her to proceed to the execution of her project and caught her in the very fact but still he passed by her offence and though he had a great mind to do it he durst not inflict any thing that was severe upon her for he knew that Cleopatra would not bear that he should have her accused on account of her hatred to him but made a show as if it were rather the generosity of his soul and his great moderation that made him forgive them However he fully proposed to himself to put this young man out of the way by one means or other but he thought he migh t Chap III ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 325 in probability be better concealed in doing it if he did it not presently nor immediately after what had lately happened 3 And now upon the approach of the feast of tabernacles which is a festival very much observed among us he let those days pass over and both he and the rest of the people were therein very merry yet did the envy which at this time arose in him cause him to make haste to do what he was about and provoke him to do it for when this youth Aristobulus who was now in the seventeenth year of his age went up to the altar ac cording to the law to offer the sacrifices and this with the orna ments of his high priesthood and when he  performed the sa cred offices he seemed to be exceeding comely and taller than men usually were at that age and to exhibit in his countenance a great deal of that high family he was sprung from and a warm zeal and affection towards him appeared among the people and the memory of the actions of his grandfather Aristobulus was fresh in their minds and their affections got so far the mastery of them that they could not forbear to show their inclinations to him They at once rejoiced and were confounded and mingled with good wishes their joyful acclamations which they made to him till the good will of the multitude was made too evident and they more rashly proclaimed the happiness they had received from his family than was fit under a monarchy to have done Upon all this Herod resolved to complete what he had intended against the young man When therefore the festival was over and he was feasting at f Jericho with Alexandra who entertained them there he was then very pleasant with the young man and drew him into a lonely place and at the same time played with him in a juvenile and ludicrous manner Now the nature of that place was hotter than ordinary so they went out in a body and of a sudden and in a vein of madness and as they stood by the fish ponds of which there were large ones about the house they went to cool themselves by bathing because it was in the midst of a hot day At first they were only spectators of Herod s servants and acquaintance as they were swimming but after a while the young man at the in stigation of Herod went into the water among them while such of Herod s acquaintance as he had appointed to do it dipped him as he was swimming and plunged him under water in the dark of the evening as if it had been done in sport only nor  This entirely confutes the Talmudists who pretend that no one under tirmtty years of age could officiate as high priest among the Jews t A Hebrew chronicle cited by Reland says this drowning was at Jordan not at Ji ric ni and tin s even when he quotes Josephus 1 suspect the transcriber of the Hebrew chronicle mistook the nanTc and wrote Jordan for Jcru tia 326 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XV did they desist till he was entirely suffocated and thus was Aris tobulus murdered having lived no more in all than  eighteen years and kept the high priesthood one year only which high priesthood Ananelus now recovered again 4 When this sad accident was told the women their joy was soon changed to lamentation at the sight of the dead body that lay before them and their sorrow was immoderate The city also of Jerusalem upon the spreading of this news were in very great grief every family looking on this calamity as if it had not belonged to another but that one of themselves was slain but Alexandra was more deeply affected upon her know ledge that he had been destroyed on purpose Her sorrow was greater than that of others by her knowing how the mur der was committed but she was under a necessity of bearing up under it out of her prospect of a greater mischief that might otherwise follow and she oftentimes came to an inclination to kill herself with her own hand but still she restrained herself in hopes she might live long enough to revenge the unjust mur der thus privately committed nay she farther resolved to en deavour to live longer and to give no occasion to think she sus pected that her son was slain on purpose and supposed that she might thereby be in a capacity of revenging it at a proper op portunity Thus did she restrain herself that she might not be noted for entertaining any such suspicion However Herod endeavoured that none abroad should believe that the child s death was caused by any design of his  and for this purpose he did not only use the ordinary signs of sorrow but fell into tears so and exhibited a real confusion of soul and perhaps his af fections were overcome on this occasion when he saw the child s countenance so young and so beautiful although his death was supposed to tend to his own security so far at least this grief served as to make some apology for him and as for his funeral that he took care should be very magnificent by mak ing great preparation for a sepulchre to lay his body in and providing a great quantity of spices and burying many orna ments together with him till the very women who were in such deep sorrow were astonished at it and received in this way some consolation 5 However no such things could overcome Alexandra s grief but the remembrance of this miserable case made her sorrow both deep and obstinate Accordingly she wrote an account of this treacherous scene to Cleopatra and how her son was mur  The reading of one of Josephus Greek MSS seems here to be right that Ar istobulus was not eighteen years old when he was drowned for he was not sevmtcfn when he was made high priest ch ii sect 6 ch iii sect 3 and he continued in that office but one year as in the place before us Chap III ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 327 dered  but Cleopatra as she had formerly been desirous to give her what satisfaction she could and commiserating Alexandra s misfortunes made the case her own and would not let Antony be quiet but excited him to punish the child s murder for that it was an unworthy thingthat Herod who had been by him made king of a kingdom that no way belonged to him should be guilty of such horrid crimes against those that were of the royal blood in reality Antony was persuaded by these arguments and when he came to Laodicea he sent and commanded Herod to come and make his defence as to what he had done to Aristo bulus for that such a treacherous design was not well done if he had any hand in it Herod was now in fear both of the ac cusation and of Cleopatra s ill will to him which was such that she was ever endeavouring to make Antony hate him He therefore determined to obey his summons for he had no pos sible way to avoid it so he left his uncle Joseph procurator for his government and for the public affairs and gave him a private charge that if Antony should kill him he also should kill Mariamne immediately for that he had a tender affection for this his wife and was afraid of the injury that should be of fered him if after his death she for her beauty should be en gaged to some other man but his intimation was nothing but this at the bottom that Antony had fallen in love with her when he had formerly heard somewhat of her beauty So when Herod had given Joseph this charge and had indeed no sure hopes of escaping with his life he went away to Antony 6 But as Joseph was administering the public affairs of the kingdom and for that reason was very frequently with Ma riamne both because his business required it and because of the respects he ought to pay to the queen he frequently let him self into discourses about Herod s kindness and great affection towards her and when the women especially Alexandra used to turn his discourses into feminine raillery Joseph was so over desirous to demonstrate the king s inclinations that he proceeded so far as to mention the charge he had received and thence drew his demonstration that Herod was not able to live without her and that if he should come to any ill end he could not endure a separation from her even after he was dead Thus spoke Joseph But the women as was natural did not take this to be an instance of Herod s strong affection for them but of hfe severe usage of them that they could not escape de structionAor a tyrannical death even when he was dead him self an Jwhis saying of Joseph s was a foundation for the women sMvere suspicions about him afterwards 7 At pis time a report went about the city Jerusalem among Herod s enemies that Antony had tortured Herod and 328 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XV put him to death This report as is natural disturbed those that were about the palace but chiefly the women Upon which Alexandra endeavoured to persuade Josephtogoout of the palace and fly to the ensigns of the Roman legion which then lay encamped about the city as a guard to the kingdom under the command of Julius for that by this means if any disturb ance should happen about the palace they should be in greater security as having the Romans favourable to them and that besides they hoped to obtain the highest authority if Antony did but once see Mariamne by whose means they should re cover the kingdom and want nothing which was reasonable for them to hope for because of their royal extraction 8 But as they were in the midst of these deliberations letters were brought from Herod about all his affairs and proved con trary to the report and of what they before expected for when he was come to Antony he soon recovered his interest with him by the presents he made him which he had brought with him from Jerusalem and he soon induced him upon discoursing with him to leave off his indignation at him so that Cleopatra s persuasions had less force than the arguments and presents he brought to regain his friendship for Antony said That it was not good to require an account of a king as to the affairs of his government for at this rate he could be no king at all but that those who had given him that authority ought to per  mit him to make use of it He also said the same things to Cleopatra that it would be best for her not busily to meddle with the acts of the king s government Herod wrote an ac count of these things and enlarged upon the other honours which he had received from Antony how he sat by him at his hearing causes and took his diet with him every day and that he enjoyed those favours from him notwithstanding the reproaches that Cleopatra so severely laid against him who having a great desire of his country and earnestly en treating Antony that the kingdom might be given to her la boured with her utmost diligence to have him out of the way but that he still found Antony just to him and had no longer any apprehensions of hard treatment from him and that he was soon upon his return with a firmer additional assurance of his favour to him in his reigning and managing public affairs and that there was no longer any hope for Cleopatra s covetous temper since Antony had given her Ccelesyria in stead of what she desired by which means he had at once pacified her and got clear of the entreaties which she made him to have Judea bestowed upon her 9 When these letters were brought the women left off their attempt for flying to the Romans which they thought of while Chap III ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 329 Herod was supposed to be dead yet was not that purpose of theirs a secret but when the king had conducted Antony on his way against the Parthians he returned to Judea when both his sister Salome and his mother informed him of Alexandra s in tentions Salome also added somewhat farther against Joseph though it were no more than a calumny that he had often had criminal conversation with Mariamne The reason of her say ing so was this that she for a long time bare her ill will for when they had differences with one another Mariamne took great freedoms and reproached the rest for the meanness of their birth But Herod whose affection to Mariamne was always very warm was presently disturbed at this and could not bear the torments of jealousy but was still restrained from doing any rash thing to her by the love he had for her yet did his vehe ment affection and jealousy together make him ask Mariamne by herself about this matter of Joseph but she denied it upon her oath and said all that an innocent woman could possibly say in her own defence so that by little and little the king was prevail ed upon to drop the suspicion and left off his anger at her and being overcome with his passion for his wife he made an apolo gy to her for having seemed to believe what he had heard about her and returned her a great many acknowledgments of her mo dest behaviour and professed the extraordinary affection and kindness he had for her till at last as is usual between lovers they both fell into tears and embraced one another with a most tender affection But as the king gave more and more assur ances of his belief of her fidelity and endeavoured to draw her to a like confidence in him Mariamne said Yet was not that command thou gavest that if any harm came to thee from Antony I who had been no occasion of it should perish with thee a sign of thy love to me When these words were fall en from her the king was shocked at them and presently let her go out of his arms and cried out and tore his hair with his own hands and said that  now he had an evident demonstration that Joseph had had criminal conversation with his wife for that he would never have uttered what he had told him alone by himself unless there had been such a great familiarity and firm confidence between them And while he was in this passion he had like to have killed his wife but being still overborne by his love to her he restrained this his passion though not with out a lasting grief and disquietness of mind However he gave order to slay Joseph without permitting him to come into his sight and as for Alexandra he bound her and kept her in custody as the cause of all this mischief 330 ANTIQUIT1KS OF THE JEWS Book XV CHAP IV How Cleopatra when she had gotten Jrom Antony some parts of Judea and Arabia came into Judea  and how Herod gave her many presents and conducted her on her isoay lack to Egypt Â 1 N ow at this time the affairs of Syria were in confusion by Cleopatra s constant persuasions to Antony to make an at tempt upon every body s dominions for she persuaded him to take those dominions away from their several princes and bestow them upon her and she had a mighty influence upon him by reason of his being enslaved to her by his af fections She was also by nature very covetous and stuck at no wickedness She had already poisoned her brother because she knew that he was to be king of Egypt and this when he was but fifteen years old and she got her sister Arsinoe to be slain by the means of Antony when she was a supplicant at Diana s temple at Ephesus for if there were but any hopes of getting money she would violate both temples and sepulchres Nor was there any holy place that was esteemed the most inviol able from which she would not fetch the ornaments it had in it nor any place so profane but was to suffer the most flagitious treatment possible from her if it could but contribute somewhat to the covetous humour of this wicked creature yet did not all this suffice so extravagant a woman who was a slave to her lusts but she still imagined that she wanted every thing she could think of and did her utmost to gain it for which rea son she hurried Antony on perpetually to deprive others of their dominions and give them to her And as she went over Syria with him she contrived to get it into her possession so he slew Lysanius the son of Ptolemy accusing him of his bringing the Parthians upon those countries She also petition ed Antony to give her Judea and Arabia and in order thereto desired him to take these countries away from their present go vernors As for Antony he was so entirely overcome by this woman that one would not think her conversation only could do it but that he was some way or other bewitched to do what soever she would have him yet did the grossest parts of her in justice make him so ashamed that he would not always heark en to her to do those flagrant enormities she would have per suaded him to That therefore he might not totally deny her nor by doing every thing which she enjoined him appear openly to be an ill man he took some parts of each of those countries away from their former governors and gave them to her Thus Chap IV ANTIO UH IES OF THE JEWS 331 he gave her the cities that were within the river Eleutherus as far as Egypt excepting Tyre and Sidon which he knew to have been free cities from their ancestors although she pressed him very often to bestow those on her also 2 When Cleopatra had obtained thus much and had accom panied Antony in his expedition to Armenia as far as Eu phrates she returned back and came to Apamia and Damascus and passed on to Judea where Herod met her and farmed of her parts of Arabia and those revenues that came to her from the region about Jericho This country bears that bal sam which is the most precious drug that is there and grows there alone The place bears also palm trees both many in number and those excellent in their kind When she was there and was very often with Herod she endeavoured to have crim inal conversation with the king Nor did she affect secrecy in the indulgence of such sort of pleasures and perhaps she had in some measure a passion of love to him or rather what is most probable she laid a treacherous snare for him by aiming to obtain such adulterous conversation from him However upon the whole she seemed overcome with love to him Now Herod had a great while borne no good will to Cleopatra as knowing that she was a woman irksome to all and at that time he thought her particularly worthy of his hatred if this attempt proceeded out of lust he had also thought of preventing her intrigues by putting her to death if such were her endeavours However he refused to comply with her proposals and called a council of his friends to consult with them Whether he should not kill her now he had her in his power for that he should thereby deliver all those from a multitude of evils to whom she was already become irksome and was expected to be still so for the time to come and that this very thing would be much for the advantage of Antony himself since she would certain ly not be faithful to him in case any such reason or necessity should come upon him as that he should stand in need of her fidelity But when he thought to follow this advice his friends would not let him and told him That in the first place it was not right to attempt so great a thing and run himself thereby into the utmost danger and they laid hard at him and begged of him to undertake nothing rashly for that Antony would never bear it no not though any one should evidently lay before his eyes that it was for his own advantage and that the appearance of depriving him of her conversation by this violent and treacherous method would probably set his affections more in a flame than before Nor did it appear that he could offer any thing of tolerable weight in his defence this defence being against such a woman as VOL II T T 2S 832 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XV  was of the highest dignity of any of her sex at that time in  the world and as to any advantage to be expected from such  an undertaking if any such could be supposed in this case it  would appear to deserve condemnation on account of the in  solence he must take upon him in doing it Which consider  ations made it very plain that in so doing he would find his  government filled with mischiefs both great and lasting both to himself and his posterity whereas it was still in his power to reject that wickedness she would persuade him to and to come off honourably at the same time So by thus affrighting Herod and representing to him the hazard he must in all probability run by this undertaking they restrained him from it So he treated Cleopatra kindly and made her presents and conducted her on her way to Egypt 3 But Antony subdued Armenia and sent Artabazes the son of Tigranes in bonds with his children and procurators to Egypt and made a present of them and of all the royal orna ments which he had taken out of that kingdom to Cleopatra And Artaxias the eldest of his sons who had escaped at that time took the kingdom of Armenia who yet was ejected by Archelaus and Nero Caesar when they restored Tigranes his younger brother to that kingdom But this happened a good while afterward 4 But then as to the tributes which Herod was to pay Cleo patra for that country which Antony had given her he acted airly with her as deeming it not safe for him to afford any cause for Cleopatra to hate him As for the king of Arabia whose tribute Herod had undertaken to pay her for some time indeed he paid him as much as came to two hundred talents but he afterward became very niggardly and slow in his pay ments and could hardly be brought to pay some parts of it and was not willing to pay even them without some deductions CHAP V How Herod made war with the king of Arabia and after they had fought many battles at length conquered him and leas chosen by the Arabs to be governor of that nation As also concerning a great earthquake 4 1 HEREUPON Herod held himself ready to go against the king of Arabia because of his ingratitude to him and be cause after all he would do nothing that was just to him al though Herod made the Roman war an occasion of delaying his own for the battle at Actium was now expected which fell in to the hundred eighty and seventh Olympiad where Caesar and Chap V ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 333 Antony were to fight for the supreme power of the world but Herod having enjoyed a country that was very fruitful and that now for a long time and having received great taxes and raised great armies therewith got together a body of men and care fully furnished them with all necessaries and designed them as auxiliaries for Antony But Antony said he had no want of his assistance but he commanded him to punish the king of Arabia for he had heard both from him and from Cleopatra how per fidious he was for this was what Cleopatra desired who thought it for her own advantage that those two kings should do one another as great a mischief as possible Upon this message from Antony Herod returned back but kept his army with him in order to invade Arabia immediately So when his army of horsemen and footmen was ready he marched to Diospolis whither the Arabians came also to meet them for they were not unapprised of this war that was coming upon them and af ter a great battle had been fought the Jews had the victory But afterward there were gotten together another numerous ar my of the Arabians at Cana which are places at Coelesyria He rod was informed of this beforehand so he came marching against them with the greatest part of the forces he had and when he was come near to Cana he resolved to encamp himself and he cast up a bulwark that he might take a proper season for attacking the enemy but as he was giving those orders the multitude of the Jews cried out that he should make no delay but lead them against the Arabians They went with great spi rit as believing they were in very good order and those espe cially were so that had been in the former battle and had been conquerors and had not permitted their enemy so much as to come to a close fight with them And when they were so tu multuous and showed such great alacrity the king resolved to make use of that zeal the multitude then exhibited and when he had assured them he would not be behindhand with them in courage he led them on and stood before them all in his ar mour all the regiments following him in their several ranks Whereupon a consternation fell upon the Arabians for when they perceived that the Jews were not to be conquered and were full of spirit the greater part of them ran away and avoided fighting and they had been quite destroyed had not Athenion fallen upon the Jews and distressed them for this man was Cleopatra s general over the soldiers she had there and was at enmity with Herod and very wistfully looked on to see what the event of the battle would be He had also resolved that in case the Arabians did any thing that was brave and successful he would He still but in case they were beaten as it really hap pened he would attack the Jews with those forces he had of his 334 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS  Book XV I own and with those that the country had gotten together for him So he fell upon the Jews unexpectedly when they were fatigued and thought they had already vanquished the enemy and made a great slaughter of them for as the Jews had spent their courage upon their known enemies and were about to en joy themselves in quietness after the victory they were easily beaten by these that attacked them afresh and in particular re ceived a great loss in places where the horses could not be of ser vice and which were very stony and where those that attacked them were better acquainted with the places than themselves And when the Jews had suffered this loss the Arabians raised their spirits after their defeat and returning back again slew those that were already put to flight and indeed all sorts of slaughter were now frequent and of those that escaped a few only returned into the camp So king Herod when he de spaired of the battle rode up to them to bring them assistance yet did he not come time enough to do them any service though he laboured hard to do it but the Jewish camp was taken so that the Arabians had unexpectedly a most glorious success having gained that victory which of themselves they were no way likely to have gained and slaying a great part of the enemy s army Whence afterward Herod could only act like a private robber and make excursions upon many parts of Arabia and distress them by sudden incursions while he encamped among the mountains and avoided by any means to come to a pitched battle yet did he greatly harass the enemy by his assiduity and the hard labour he took in this matter He also took great care of his own forces and used all the means he could to restore his affairs to their old state 2 At this time it was that the fight happened at Actium be tween Octavius Caesar and Antony in  the seventh year of the reign of Herod and then it was also there was an earthquake in Judea such a one as had not happened at any other time and which earthquake brought a great destruction upon the cattle in that country About ten thousand men also perished by the fall of houses but the army which lodged in the field received no damage by this sad accident When the Arabians were inform ed of this and when those that hated the Jews and pleased them selves with aggravating the reports told them of it they raised their spirits as if their enemy s country was quite overthrown  The reader is here to take notice that this seventh year of the reign of Herod and all the other years of his reign in Josephus are dated from the death of Anti gonus or at the soonest from the conquest of Antigonus and the taking of Jerusa lem a few months before and never from his first obtaining the kingdom at Rome above three years before as some have very weakly and injudiciously done Chap V ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 335 and the men were utterly destroyed and thought there now re mained nothing that could oppose them Accordingly they took the Jewish ambassadors who came to them after all this had hap pened to make peace with them and slew them and came with great alacrity against their army but the Jews durst not with stand them and were so cast down by the calamities they were under that they took no care of their affairs but gave up them selves to despair for they had no hope that they should be upon a level again with them in battles nor obtain any assistance else where while their affairs at home were in such great distress also When matters were in this condition the king persuaded the commanders by his words and tried to raise their spirits which were quite sunk and first he endeavoured to encourage and embolden some of the better sort beforehand and then ven tured to make a speech to the multitude which he had before avoided to do lest he should find them uneasy thereat because of the misfortunes which had happened so he made a consolatory speech to the multitude in the manner following 3  You are not unacquainted my fellow soldiers that we have had not long since many accidents that have put a stop to what we are about and it is probable that even those that arembstdistinguishedaboveothers fortheircourage can hardly keep up their spirits in such circumstances but since we can not avoid fighting and nothing that hath happened is of such a nature but it may by ourselves be recovered into a good state and this by one brave action only well performed I have pro posed to myself both to give you some encouragement and at the same time some information both which parts of my de sign will tend to this point that you may still continue in your own proper fortitude I will then in the first place demon strate to you that this war is a just one on our side and that on this account it is a war of necessity and occasioned by the injustice of our adversaries for if you be once satisfied of this it will be a real cause of alacrity to you after which I will farther demonstrate that the misfortunes we are under are of no great consequence and that we have the greatest rea ff son to hope for victory I shall begin with the first and  appeal to yourselves as witnesses to what I shall say You are not ignorant certainly of the wickedness of the Arabians which is to that degree as to appear incredible to all other men and to include somewhat that shows the grossest bar barity and ignorance of God Their chief things wherein they have affronted us have arisen from covetousness and envy and they have attacked us in an insidious manner and on the sudden And what occasion is there for me to mention many instances of such their procedure When they 336 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XV were in danger of losing their own government of themselves and of being slaves to Cleopatra what others were they that freed them from that fear For it was the friendship I had with Antony and the kind disposition he was in towards us that hath been the occasion that even these Arabians have not been utterly undone Antony being unwilling to undertake any thing which might be suspected by us of unkindness but when he had a mind to bestow some parts of each of our dominions on Cleopatra I also managed that matter so that by giving him presents of my own I might obtain a security to both nations while I undertook myself to answer for the money and gave him two hundred talents and became surety for those two hundred more which were imposed upon the land that was subject to this tribute  and this they have defrauded us of although it was not reasonable that Jews should pay tribute to any man living or allow part of their land to be taxable but although that was to be yet ought we not to pay tribute for these Arabians whom we have ourselves preserved nor is it fit that they who have professed and that with great in tegrity and sense of our kindness that it is by our means that they keep their principality should injure us and deprive us of what is our due and this while we have been still not their enemies but their friends And whereas observation of co venants takes place among the bitterest enemies but among friends is absolutely necessary this is not observed among these men who think gain to be the best of all things let it be by any means whatsoever and that injustice is no harm if they may but get money by it is it therefore a questipn with you Whether the unjust are to be punished or not When God himself hath declared his mind that so it ought to be and hath commanded us that we ever should hate injuries and injus tice which is not only just but necessary in wars between se veral nations for these Arabians have done what both the Greeks and Barbarians own to be an instance of the grossest wickedness with regard to our ambassadors which they have beheaded while the Greeks declare that such ambassadors are  sacred and inviolable And for ourselves we have learn ed from God the most excellent of our doctrines and the most holy part of our law by angels or ambassadors for this name brings God to the knowledge of mankind and is sufficient to reconcile enemies one to another What wickedness then can be greater than the slaughter of ambassadors who come to  Herod says here that as ambassadors were sacred when they carried messages to others so did the laws of the Jews derive a sacred authority by being delivered from God by angels or divine ambassadors which is St Paul s expression about the same laws Gal iii 19 Heb ii 2 Chap V ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 337 treat about doing what is right And when such have been their actions how is it possible they can either live securely in common life or be successful in war in my opinion this is impossible but perhaps some will say that what is holy and what is righteous is indeed on our side but the Arabians are either more courageous or more numerous than we are Now as to this in the first place it is not fit for us to say so for with whom is what is righteous with them is God him self now where God is there is both multitude and courage But to examine our own circumstances a little we were con querors in the first battle and when we fought again they were not able to oppose us but ran away and could not en dure our attacks or our courage but when we had conquered them then came Athenion and made war against us with out declaring it and pray is this an instance of their man hood or is it not a second instance of their wickedness and treachery Why are we therefore of less courage on account  of that which ought to inspire us with stronger hopes and M why are we terrified at these who when they fight upon the level are continually beaten and when they seem to be con querors they gain it by wickedness and if we suppose that any one should deem them to be men of real courage will not he be excited by that very consideration to do his utmost against them for true valour is not shown by fighting against weak persons but in being able to overcome the most hardy But then if the distresses we are ourselves under and the mi series that hath come by the earthquake hath affrighted any one let him consider in the first place that this very thing will deceive the Arabians by their supposal that what hath befallen us is greater than it really is Moreover it is not right that the same thing that emboldens them should discour age us for these men you see do not derive their alacrity from any advantageous virtue of their own but from their hope as to us that we are quite cast down by our misfbr tunes but when we boldly march against them we shall soon pull down their insolent conceit of themselves and shall gain this by attacking them that they will not be so insolent when we come to the battle for our distresses are not so great nci is what hath happened an indication of the anger of God against us as some imagine for such things are accidental and adversities that come in the usual course of things and if we allow that this was done by the will of God we must al low that it is now over by his will also and that he is satis fied with what hath already happened for had he been willing to afflict us still more thereby he had not changed his mind so soon And as for the war we are engaged in he hath him self demonstrated that he is willing it should go on and that 338 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEVVh Book XV he knows it to be a just war for while some of the people in the country have perished all you who were in arms have suf fered nothing but are all preserved alive whereby God makes it plain to us that if you had universally with your children and wives been in the army it had come to pass that you had not undergone any thing that would have much hurt you Consider these things and what is more than all M the rest that you have God at all times for your protector and prosecute these men with a just bravery who in point of friendship are unjust in their battles perfidious towards am bassadors impious and always inferior to you in valour 4 When the Jews heard this speech they were much raised in their minds and more disposed to fight than before So He rod when he had  offered the sacrifices appointed by the law made haste and took them and led them against the Arabians and in order to that passed over Jordan and pitched his camp near to that of the enemy He also thought fit to seize upon a certain castle that lay in the midst of them as hoping it would be for his advantage and would the sooner produce a battle and that if there were occasion for delay he should by it have his camp fortified and as the Arabians had the same intentions upon that place a contest arose about it at first they were but skirmishes after which there came more soldiers and it proved a sort of fight and some fell on both sides till those of the Ara bian side were beaten and retreated This was no small encour agement to the Jews immediately and when Herod observed that the enemies army was disposed to any thing rather than to come to an engagement he ventured boldly to attempt the bul wark itself and to pull it to pieces and so to get nearer to their camp in order to fight them for when they were forced out of their trenches they went out in disorder and had not the least alacrity or hope of victory yet did they fight hand to hand because they were more in number than the Jews and because they were in such a disposition of war that they were under a necessity of coming on boldly so they came to a terrible battle while not a few fell on each side However at length the Ara  This piece of religion the supplicating God with sacrifices by Herod before he went to this fight with the Arabians taken notice of also in the first book of the War ch xix sect 5 vol III is worth remarking because it is the only example ot this nature so far as I remember that Josephus ever mentions in all his large and particular accounts of this Herod and it was when he had been in mighty distress and discouraged by a great defeat of his former army and by a very great earthquake in Judea such times of affliction making men most religious Nor was he disap pointed of his hopes here but immediately gained a most signal victory over the Arabians while they who just before had been so great victors and so much elevated upon the earthquake in Judca as to venture to slay the Jewish ambassadors wen now under a strange consternation and hardly able to fight at all Chap VI ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 339 bians fled and so great a slaughter was made upon their being routed that they were not only killed by their enemies but became the authors of their own deaths also and were trodden down by the multitude and the great current of people in dis order and were destroyed by their own armour so five thou sand men lay dead upon the spot while the rest of the multi tude soon ran within the bulwark for safety but had no firm hope of safety by reason of their want of necessaries and es pecially of water The Jews pursued them but could not get in with them but sat round about the bulwark and watched any assistance that would get in to them and prevented any there that had a mind to it from running away 5 When the Arabians were in these circumstances they sent ambassadors to Herod in the first place to propose terms of ac commodation and after that to offer him so pressing was their thirst upon them to undergo whatsoever he pleased if he would free them from their present distress but he would admit of no ambassadors of no price of redemption nor of any other mode rate terms whatever being very desirous to revenge those unjust actions which they had been guilty of towards his nation So they were necessitated by other motives and particularly by their thirst to come out and deliver themselves up to him to be car ried away captives and in five days time the number of four thousand were taken prisoners while all the rest resolved to make a sally upon their enemies and to fight it out with them choos ing rather if so it must be to die therein than to perish gradu ally and ingloriously When they had taken this resolution they came out of their trenches but could no way sustain the fight being too much disabled both in mind and body and hav ing not room to exert themselves and thought it an advantage to bekilled and a misery to survive so at the first onset there fell about seven thousand of them after which stroke they let all the courage they had put on before fall and stood amazed at Herod s warlike spirit under his own calamities so for the future they yielded and made him ruler of their nation whereupon he was greatly elevated at so seasonable a success and returned home taking great authority upon him on account of so bold and glo rious an expedition as he had made CHAP VI Haw Herod slew Hyrcanus and then hasted away to Ctesar and obtained the kingdom from him also and how a little time af terward he entertained Ctxsar in a most honourable manner  1 HEROD S other affairs were now very prosperous and he was not to be easily assaulted on any side Yet did there VOL iI u u 25 340 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS liook XV come upon him u danger that would hazard his entire domin ions after Antony had been beaten at the battle of Actium by Caesar Octavian for at that time both Herod s enemies and friends despaired of his affairs for it was not probable that he would remain without punishment who had showed so much friendship for Antony So it happened that his friends despair ed and had no hopes of his escape but for his enemies they all outwardly appeared to be troubled at his case but were privately very glad of it as hoping to obtain a change for the better As for Herod himself he saw that there was no one of royal dig nity left but Hyrcanus and therefore he thought it would be for his advantage not to suffer him to be an obstacle in his way any longer for that in case he himself survived and escaped the dan ger he was in he thought it the safest way to put it out of the power of such a man to make any attempt against him at such C mctures of affairs as was more worthy of the kingdom than imself and in case he should bo slain by Caesar his envy prompted him to desire to slay him that would otherwise be king after him 2 While Herod had these things in his mind there was a cer tain occasion afforded him for Hyrcanus was of so mild a tem per both then and at other times that he desired not to meddle with public affairs nor to concern himself with innovations but left all to fortune and contented himself with what that af forded him But Alexandra his daughter was a lover of strife and was exceeding desirous of a change of the government and spake to her father not to bear for ever Herod s injurious treat ment of their family but to anticipate their future hopes as he safely might and desired him to write about these matters to Malchus who was then governor of Arabia to receive them and to secure them from Herod for that if they went away and Herod s affairs proved to be as it was likely they would be by reason of Caesar s enmity to him they should then be the on ly persons that could take the government and this both on ac count of the royal family they were of and on account of the good disposition of the multitude to them While she used these persuasions Hyrcanus put off her suit but as she showed that she was a woman and a contentious woman too and would not desist either night or clay but would always be speaking to him about these matters and about Herod s treacherous designs she at last prevailed with him to entrust Dositheus one of his friends with a letter wherein his resolution was declared and he de sired the Arabian governor to send to him some horsemen who should receive him and conduct him to the lake Asphaltites which is from the bounds of Jerusalem three hundred furlongs and he did therefore trust Dositheus with this letter because he Chap VI ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 84 1 was a careful attender on him and on Alexandra and had no small occasions to bear ill will to Herod for he was a kinsman of one Joseph whom he had slain and a brother of those that were formerly slain at Tyre by Antony yet could not these mo tives induce Dositheus to serve Hyrcanus in this affair for prefer  ing the hopes he had from the present king to those he had from him he gave Herod the letter So he took his kindness in good part and bid him besides do what he had already done that is go on in serving him by rolling up the epistle and sealing it again and delivering it to Malchus and then to bring back his letter in answer to it for it would be much better if he could know Malchus intentions also And when Dositheus was very ready to serve him in this point also the Arabian governor returned back for answer that he would receive Hyrcanus and all that should come with him and even all the Jews that were of his party that he would moreover send forces sufficient to secure them in their journey and that he should be in no want of any thing he should desire Now as soon as Herod had received this letter he immediately sent for Hyrcanus and questioned him about the league he had made with Malchus  and when he denied it showed his letter to the sanhedrim and put the man to death immediately 3 And this account we give the reader as it is contained in the commentaries of king Herod but other historians do not agree with them for they suppose that Herod did not find but rather make this an occasion for thus putting him to death and that by treacherously laying a snare for him for thus do they write That Herod and he were once at a treat and that Herod had given no occasion to suspect that he was displeased at him but put this question to Hyrcanus Whether he had received any letters from Malchus And when he answered that he had re ceived letters but those of salutation only and when he asked farther whether he had not received any presents from him  and when he had replied that he had received no more than four horses to ride on which Malchus had sent him and they pre tend that Herod charged these upon him as the crimes of brib ery and treason and gave order that he should be led away and slain And in order to demonstrate that he had been guilty of no offence when he was thus brought to his end they alleged how mild his temper had been and that even in his youth he had never given any demonstration of boldness or rashness and that the case was the same when he came to be king but that he even then committed the management of the greatest part of public affairs to Antipater and that he was now above four score years old and knew that Herod s government was in a se cure state He also came over Euphrates and left those who 842 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XV greatly honoured him beyond that river though he were to be entirely under Herod s government and that it was a most in credible thing that he should enterprise any thing by way of in novation and not at all agreeable to his temper but that this was 9 plot of Herod s contrivance 4 And this was the fate of Hyrcanus and thus did he end his iife after he had endured various and manifold turns of for tune in his lifetime For he was made high priest of the Jew ish nation in the beginning of his mother Alexandra s reign who held the government nine years and when after his mo ther s death he took the kingdom himself and held it three months he lost it by the means of his brother Aristobulus He was then restored by Pompey and received all sorts of ho nour from him and enjoyed them forty years but when he was again deprived by Antigonus and was maimed in his body he was made a captive by the Parthians and thence returned home again after some time on account of the hopes that He rod had given him none of which came to pass according to his expectation but he still conflicted with many misfortunes through the whole course of his life and what was the heaviest calamity of all as we have related already he came to an end which was undeserved by him His character appeared to be that of a man of a mild and moderate disposition and suffered the administration of affairs to be generally done by others un der him He was averse to much meddling with the public nor had shrewdness enough to govern a kingdom And both Antipater and Herod came to their greatness by reason of his mildness and at last he met with such an end from them as was not agreeable either to justice or piety 5 Now Herod as soon as he had put Hyrcanus out of the way made haste to Caesar and because he could not have any hopes of kindness from him on account of the friendship he had for Antony he had a suspicion of Alexandra lest she should take this opportunity to bring the multitude to a revolt and intro duce a sedition into the affairs of the kingdom so he commit ted the care of every thing to his brother Pheroras and placed his mother Cypros and his sister Salome and the whole family at Massada and gave him a charge that if he should hear any sad news about him he should take care of the gov ernment But as to Mariamne his wife because of the mis understanding between her and his sister and his sister s mo ther which made it impossible for them to live together he placed her at Alexandrium with Alexandra her molher and left his treasurer Joseph and Sohemus of Iturea to take care of that fortress These two had been very faithful to him from the beginning and were now left as a guard to the wo Chap VI ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 343 men They also had it in charge that if they should hear any mischief had befallen him they should kill them both and as far as they were able to preserve the kingdom for his sons and for his brother Pheroras 6 When he had given them this charge he made haste to Rhodes to meet Caesar and when he had sailed to that city he took off his diadem but remitted nothing else of his usual dignity And when upon his meeting him he desired that he would let him speak to him he therein exhibited a much more noble specimen of a great soul for he did not betake himself to supplications as men usually do upon such occasions nor offered him any petition as if he were an offender but after an un daunted manner gave an account of what he had done for he spake thus to Caesar That  he had the greatest friendship for Antony and did every thing he could that he might attain the government That he was not indeed in the army with him because the Arabians had diverted him but that he had sent him both money and corn which was but too little in com parison of what he ought to have done for him for if a man owns himself to be another s friend and knows him to be a benefactor he is obliged to hazard every thing to use every faculty of his soul every member of his body and all the wealth he hath for him in which I confess I have been too deficient However I am conscious to myself that so far I have done right that I have not deserted him upon his defeat at Actium nor upon the evident change of his fortune have I transferred my hopes from him to another but have pre served myself though not as a valuable fellow soldier yet certainly as a faithful counsellor to Antony when I demon strated to him that the only way that he had to save himself and not to lose all his authority was to slay Cleopatra for when she was once dead there would be room for him to re tain his authority and rather to bring thee to make a compo sition with him than to continue at enmity any longer None of which advices would he attend too but preferred his own rash resolutions before them which have happened unpro fitably for him but profitably for thee Now therefore in case thou determines about me and my alacrity in serving Antony according to thy anger at him I own there is no room for me to deny what I have done nor will I be ashamed to own and that publicly too that I had a great kindness for him But if thou wilt put him out of the case and only ex amine how I behave myself to my benefactors in general and what sort of a friend I am thou wilt rind by experience that  we shall do and be the same to thyselfj for h is but changing the names and the firmness of friendship that we shall bear to thee will not be disapproved by thee ANTigurriEs OF THE JEWS Book XV 7 By this speech and by his behaviour which showed Cae sar the frankness of his mind he greatly gained upon him who was himself of a generous and magnificent temper insomuch that those very actions which were the foundation of the accu sation against him procured him Caesar s good will Accord ingly he restored him his diadem again and encouraged him to exhibit himself as great a friend to himself as he had been to Antony and then had him in great esteem Moreover he ad ded this that Quintius Didius had written to him that Herod had very readily assisted him in the affair of the gladiators So when he had obtained such a kind reception and had bevond all his hopes procured his crown to be more entirely and firmly settled upon him than ever by Caesar s donation as well as by that decree of the Romans which Caesar took care to procure for his greater security he conducted Caesar on his way to Egypt and made presents even beyond his ability to both him and his friends and in general behaved himself with great mag nanimity He also desired that Caesar would not put to death one Alexander who had been a companion of Antony s but Caesar had sworn to put him to death and so he could not ob tain that his petition And now he returned to Judea again with greater honour and assurance than ever and affrighted those that had expectations to the contrary as still acquiring from his very dangers greater splendour than before by the favour oi God to him So he prepared for the reception of Cassar as he was going out of Syria to invade Egypt and when he came he entertained him at Ptolemais with all royal magnificence He also bestowed presents on the army and brought them provi sions in abundance He also proved to be one of Caesar s most cordial friends and put the army in array and rode along with Caesar and had a hundred and fifty men well appointed in all respects after a rich and sumptuous manner for the better re ception of him and his friends He also provided them with what they should want as they passed over the dry desert insomuch that they lacked neither wine nor water which last the soldiers stood in the greatest need of and besides he pre sented Caesar with eight hundred talents and procured to him self the good will of them all because he was assisting to them in a much greater and more splendid degree than the kingdom he had obtained could afford by which means he more and more de monstrated to Caesar the thinness of his friendship and his readi ness to assist him and what was of the greatest advantage to him was this that his liberality came at a seasonable time also And when they returned again out of Egypt his assistances were no way inferior to the good offices he had formerly done them Chap VII ANTIQUITIKS OF THE JEWS 345 CHAP VII How Herod sieve Sohemus and Mariamne and afterward Alex andra and Costobarus and his mast intimate friends and at last the sons of Baba also Â 1 Irl OWEVER when he came into his kingdom agam he found his house all in disorder and his wife Mariamne and her mother Alexandra very uneasy for as they supposed what was easy to be supposed that they were not put into that fortress EAlexandrium for the security of their persons but as into a garrison for their imprisonment and that they had no power over any thing either of others or of their own affairs they were very uneasy and Mariamne supposing that the king s love to her was but hypocritical and rather pretended as ad vantageous to himself as real she looked upon it as fallacious She also was grieved that he would not allow her any hopes of surviving him if he should come to any harm himself She also recollected what commands he had formerly given to Jo seph insomuch that she endeavoured to please her keepers and especially Sohemus as well apprised how all was in his power And at the first Sohemus was faithful to Herod and neglected none of the things he had given him in charge but when the women by kind words and liberal presents had gain ed his affections over to them he was by degrees overcome and at length discovered to them all the king s injunctions and this i on that account principally that he did not so much as hope he would come back with the same authority he had before o that he thought he should both escape any danger from him and supposed that he did hereby mucirgratify the women who were Mkely not to be overlooked in the settling of the government nay that they would be able to make him abundant recom pense since they must either reign themselves or be very near to him that should reign He had a furthep ground of hope al so that though Herod should have all the success he could wish for and should return again he could not contradict his wife in what she desired for he knew that the king s fondness for his wife was inexpressible These were the motives that drew So hemus to discover what injunctions had been given him So Mariamne was greatly displeased to hear that there was no end of the dangers she was under from Herod and was greatly un easy at it and wished that he might obtain no favours from Caesar and esteemed it almost an insupportable task to live with him any longer and this she afterward openly declared without concealing her resentment S4G ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XV 2 And now Herod sailed home with joy at the unexpected good success he had had and went first of all as was proper to this his wife and told her and her only the good news as pre ferring her before the rest on account of his fondness for her and the intimacy there had been between them and saluted her but so it happened that as he told her of the good success he had had she was so far from rejoicing at it that she rather was sorry for it nor was she able to conceal her resentments but de pending on her dignity and the nobility of her birth in return for his salutations she gave a groan and declared evidently that she rather grieved than rejoiced at his success and this till He rod was disturbed at her as affording him not only marks of her suspicion but evident signs of her dissatisfaction This much troubled him to see that this surprising hatred of his wife to him was not concealed but open and he took this so ill and yet was so unable to bear it on account of the fondness he had for her that he could not long continue in any one mind but sometimes was angry at her and sometimes reconciled himself to her but by always changing one passion for another he was still in great uncertainty and thus was he entangled between hatred and love and was frequently disposed to inflict punishment on her for her insolence towards him but being deeply in love with her in his soul he was not able to get quit of this woman In short as he would gladly have her punished so was he afraid lest ere he were aware he should by putting her to death bring a heavier pun ishment upon himself at the same time 3 When Herod s sister and mother perceived that he was in this temper with regard to Mariamne they thought they had now got an excellent opportunity to exercise their hatred against her and provoked Herod to wrath by telling him such long sto ries and calumnies about her as might at once excite his hatred and his jealousy Now though he willingly enough heard their words yet had not he courage enough to do any thing to her as if he believed them but still he became worse and worse disposed to her and these ill passions were more and more inflamed on both sides while she did not hide her disposi tion towards him and he turned his love to her into wrath against her But when he was just going to put this matter past all remedy he heard the news that Caesar was the victor in the war and that Antony and Cleopatra were both dead and that he had conquered Egypt whereupon he made haste to go to meet Caesar and left the affairs of his family in their present state However Mariamne recommended Sohemus to him as he was setting out on his journey and professed that she owed him thanks for the care he had taken of her and asked of the king for him a place in the government upon which an honourable Chap VII ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 84 7 employment was bestowed upon him accordingly Now when Herod was come into Egypt he was introduced to Caesar with great freedom as already a friend of his and received very great favours from him for he made him a present of those four hundred Galatians who had been Cleopatra s guards and restor ed that country to him again which by her means had been taken away from him He also added to his kingdom Gadara Hippos and Samaria and besides those the maritime cities Gaza and Anthedon and Joppa and Strato s Tower 4 Upon these new acquisitions he grew more magnificent and conducted Caesar as far as Antioch but upon his return as much as his prosperity was augmented by the foreign additions that had been made him so much the greater were the distresses that came upon him in his own family and chiefly in the affair of his wife wherein he formerly appeared to have been most of all fortunate for the affection he had for Mariamne was no way inferior to the affections of such as are on that account celebrated in history and this very justly As for her she was in other respects a chaste woman and faithful to him yet had she somewhat of a woman rough by nature and treated her hus band imperiously enough because she saw he was so fond of her as to be enslaved to her She did not also consider seasonably with herself that she lived under a monarchy and that she was at another s disposal and accordingly would behave herself after a saucy manner to him which yet he usually put off in a jesting way and bore with moderation and good temper She would also expose his mother and his sister openly on account of the meanness of their birth and would speak unkindly of them in somuch that there was before this a disagreement and unpardon able hatred among the women and it was now come to greater reproaches of one another than formerly which suspicions in creased and lasted a whole year after Herod returned from Cae sar However these misfortunes which had been kept under some decency for a great while burst out all at once upon such an occasion as was now offered for as the king was one day about noon lain down on his bed to rest him he called for Ma riamne out of the great affection he had always for her She came in accordingly but would not lie down by him and when he was very desirous of her company she showed her contempt of him and added by way of reproach that he had caused  her  Whereas Mariamne is here represented as reproaching Herod with the murder of icrfather Alexander as well as her brother Aristobulus while it was her grandfather Hyrcanus ana not her father Alexander whom be caused to be slain fas Josephus himself informs us ch vi sect 2 we must either take Zonora s read ing which is here grandfather rightly or else we must u before ch i sect 1 allow a slip of Josephus pen or memory in the place before us VOL II XX   25 318 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XV father and her brother to be slain And when he took this in jury very unkindly and was ready to use violence to her in a precipitate manner the king s sister Salome observingthathe was more than ordinarily disturbed sent into the king his cup bearer who had been prepared long beforehand for such a design and bid him tell the king how Mariamne had persuaded him to give his assistance in preparing a love potion for him and if he appear to be greatly concerned and to ask what that love potion was to tell him that she had the potion and that he was de sired only to give it him but that in case he did not appear to be much concerned at this potion to let the thing drop and that i he did so no harm should thereby come to him When she had given him these instructions she sent him in at this time to make such a speech So he went in after a composed manner to gain credit to what he should say and yet somewhat hastily and said that  Mariamne had given him presents and persuaded him to give him a love potion And when this moved the king he said that  this love potion was a composition that she had given him whose effects he did not know which was the reason of his resolving to give him this information as the safest course he could take both for himself and for the king When Herod heard what he said and was in an ill disposition before his indignation grew more violent and he ordered that eunuch of Mariamne s who was most faithful to her to be brought to torture about this potion as well knowing it was not possible that any thing small or great could be done without him And when the man was under the utmost agonies he could say no thing concerning the thing he was tortured about but so far he new that Mariamne s hatred against him was occasioned by somewhat that Sohemus had said to her Now as he was say ing this Herod cried out aloud and said that  Sohemus who had been at all other times most faithful to him and to his go vernment would not have betrayed what injunctions he had given him unless he had had a nearer conversation than ordin ary with Mariamne So he gave order that Sohemus should be seized on and slain immediately buthe allowed his wife to take her trial and got together those that were most faithful to him and laid an elaborate accusation against her for this love potion and composition which had been charged upon her by way of calumny only However he kept no temper in what he said and was in too great a passion for judging well about this matter Accordingly when the court was at length satisfied that he was so resolved they passed the sentence of death upon her but when the sentence was passed upon her this temper was suggest ed by himself and by some others of the court that she should not be thus hastily put to death but be laid in prison in one ot Chap VII ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 349 the fortresses belonging to the kingdom but Salome and her party laboured hard to have the woman put to death and they prevailed with the king to do so and advised this out of cau tion lest the multitude should be tumultuous if she were suf fered to live and thus was Mariamne led to execution 5 When Alexandra observed how things went and that there were small hopes that he herself should escape the like treat ment from Herod she changed her behaviour to quite the reverse of what might have been expected from her former boldness and this after a very indecent manner for out of her desire to show how entirely ignorant she was of the crimes laid against Mari amne she leaped out of her place and reproached her daughter in the hearing of all the people and cried out That  she had been an ill woman and ungrateful to her husband and that her punishment came justly upon her for such her insolent behaviour for that she had not made proper returns to him who had been their common benefactor And when she had for some time acted after this hypocritical manner and been so outrageous as to tear her hair this indecent and dissembling behaviour as was to be expected was greatly condemned by the rest of the spectators as it was principally by the poor woman who was to suffer for at the first she gave her not a word nor was discomposed at her peevishness and only looked at her yet did she out of a greatness of soul discover her concern for her mother s offence and especially for her exposing herself in a man ner so unbecoming her but as for herself she went to her death with an unshaken firmness of mind and without changing the colour of her face and thereby evidently discovered the nobil ity of her descent to the spectators even in the last moments of her life 6 And thus died Mariamne a woman of an excellent char acter both for chastity and greatness of soul but she wanted moderation and had too much of contention in her nature yet had she all that can be said in the beauty of her body and her majestic appearance in conversation and thence arose the great est part of the occasions why she did not prove so agreeable to the king nor live so pleasantly with him as she might otherwise have done for while she was most indulgently used by the king out of his fondness to her and did not expect that he could do any hard thing to her she took too unbounded a liberty More over that which most afflicted her was what he had done to hei relations and she ventured to speak of all they had suffered by him fand at last greatly provoked both the king s mother and sister till they became enemies to her and even he himself also did the same on whom alone she depended for her expectations of escaping the last of punishments 350 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XV 7 But when she was once dead the king s affections for her were kindled in a more outrageous manner than before whose old passion for her we have already described for his love to hel Tvas not of a calm nature nor such as we usually meet with among other husbands for at its commencement it was of an enthusiastic kind nor was it by their long cohabitation and free conversation together brought under his power to manage but at this time his love to Mariamne seemed to seize him in such a peculiar manner as looked like divine vengeance upon him for the tak ing away her life for he would frequently call for her and fre quently lament for her in a most indecent manner Moreover he bethought him of every thing he could make use of to divert his mind from thinking of her and contrived feasts and assem blies for that purpose but nothing would suffice he therefore laid aside the administration of public affairs and was so far con quered by his passion that he would order his servants to call for Mariamne as if she were still alive and could still hear them And when he was in this way there arose a pestilential disease and carried off the greatest part of the multitude and of his best and most esteemed friends and made all men suspect that this was brought upon them by the anger of God for the injustice that had been done to Mariamne This circumstance affected the king still more till at length he forced himself to go into de sert places and there under pretence of going a hunting bitterly afflicted himself yet had he not borne his grief there many days before he fell into a most dangerous distemper himself He had an inflammation upon him and a pain in the hinder part of his head joined with madness and for the remedies that were used they did him no good at all but proved contrary to his case and so at length brought him to despair All the physi cians also that were about him partly because the medicines they brought for his recovery could not at all conquer the disease and partly because his diet could be no other than what his dis ease inclined him to desired him to eat whatever he had a mind to and so left the small hopes they had of his recovery in the power of that diet and committed him to fortune And thus did his distemper go on while he was at Samaria now called Sebaste 8 Now Alexandra abode at this time in Jerusalem and being informed what condition Herod was in she endeavoured to get possession of the fortified places that were about the city which were two the one belonging to the city itself the other be longing to the temple and those that could get them into their hands had the whole nation under their power for without the command of them it was not possible to offer their sacrifices and to think of leaving off those sacrifices is to every Jew plain Chap Vil ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 851 ly impossible who are still more ready to lose their lives than to leave off that divine worship which they have been wont to pay unto God Alexandra therefore discoursed with those that had the keeping of these strongholds that it was proper for them to deliver the same to her and to Herod s sons lest upon his death any other person should seize upon the go vernment and that upon his recovery none could keep them more safely for him than those of his own family These words were not by them at all taken in good part and as they had been in former times faithful to Herod they resolved to continue so more than ever both because they hated Alexandra and be cause they thought it a sort of impiety to despair of Herod s re covery while he was yet alive for they had been his old friends and one of them whose name was Achiabus was his cousin ger man They sent messengers therefore to acquaint him with Alexandra s design so he made no longer delay but gave or ders to have her slain yet was it still with difficulty and after he had endured great pain that he got clear of his distemper He was still sorely afflicted both in mind and body and made very uneasy and readier than ever upon all occasions to inflict punishment upon those that fell under his hand He also slew the most intimate of his friends Costobarus and Lysimachus and Gadias who was also called Antipater as also Dositheus and that upon the following occasion 9 Costobarus was an Idumean by birth and one of principal Â  dignity among them and one whose ancestors had been priestsX to the Kose whom the Idumeans had formerly esteemed as a god but after Hyrcanus had made a change in their political government and made them receive the Jewish customs and law Herod madeCostobarus governojiof Idumeaand Gaza and wife and this was upon his slaugh ter of his uncle Joseph whoJiadjhaLgQyernment before as we have relateoTalreadyT Wtren Costobarus had gotten to be so highly advanced it pleased him and was more than he hoped for and he was more and more puffed up by his good success and in a little while he exceeded all bounds and did not think fit to obey what Herod as their ruler commanded him or that the Idumeans should make use of the Jewish customs or be sub ject to them He therefore sent to Cleopatra and informed her that the Idumeans had been always under his progenitors and that for the same reason it was but just that she should desire that country for him of Antony for that he was ready to transfer his friendship to her and this he did not because he was better pleased to be under Cleopatra s government but because he thought that upon the diminution of Herod s power it would not be difficult for him to obtain himself the entire government 352 ANTIQUITIES OF THE IEWS Book XV over the Idumeans and somewhat more also for he raised his hopes still higher as having no small pretences both by his birth and by these riches which he had gotten by his constant attention to filthy lucre and accordingly it was not a small matter that he aimed at So Cleopatra desired this country of Antony but failed of her purpose An account of this was brought to Herod who was thereupon ready to kill Costobarus yet upon the entreaties of his sister and mother he forgave him and vouchsafed to pardon him entirely though he still had a sus picion of him afterward for this his attempt 10 But some time afterward when Salome happened to quar rel with Costobarus she  sent him  bill of divorce and dis j solved her marriage with him though this was not according to the Jewish laws for with us it is lawful for a husband to do so but a wife if she departs from her husband cannot of her self be married to another unless her former husband put her away However Salome chose to follow not the law of her Country but the law of her authority and so renounced her wedlock and told her brother Herod that she left her husband Aut of her good will to him because she perceired that he with wintipater and Lysimachus and Dositheus were raising a sedi e tion against him as an evidence whereof she alleged the case of the sons of Babas that they had been by him preserved alive already for the interval of twelve years which proved to be true But when Herod thus unexpectedly heard of it he was greatly surprised at it and was the more surprised because the relation appeared incredible to him As for the fact relating to these sons of Babas Herod had formerly taken great pains to bring them to punishment as being enemies to his government but they were now forgotten by him on account of the length of time since he had ordered them to be slain Now the cause of his ill will and haired to them arose hence that while Anti gonus was king Herod with his army besieged the city of Je  Here is a plain example of a Jewibh lady giving a bill of divorce lo her hus hand though in the days of Josephus it was not esteemed lawful for a

husband as well as the innocent husband to di vorce his guilty wit i as we learn from the shepherd of Hermes Aland B IV and fjom the second apology of Justin Martyr where a persecution was brought upon the Christians upon such a divorce and I think the Roman laws permitted it at that time as well as the laws of Christianity Now this Bal as who was one of the race of the Asamoncans or Maccabees as the latter end of this section informs us is related by ihe Jews as Dr Hudson here remarks to have been Â o eminently religious in the Jewish way that the day following thÂ tenth of Tisri the great day of atonement when he seems to hare supposed all his sins entirely forgiven he used every day of the whole year to oiler a sacrifice for his sins of ignorance or such as he supposed he had been guilty of but did not distinctly rcmcmler See somewhat like it of Agrippathc Great Aniiq B XIX ch iii sect 3 vol III and Job i 4 S Chap VJII ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 353 rusalem where the distress and miseries which the besieged en dured were so pressing that the greater number of them in vited Herod into the city and already placed their hopes on him Now the sons of Babas were of great dignity and had power among the multitude and were faithful to Antigonus and were always raising calumnies against Herod and encouraged the peo ple to preserve the government to that royal family which held it by inheritance So these men acted thus politically and as they thought for their own advantage but when the city was taken and Herod had gotten the government into his hands and Costobarus was appointed to hinder men from passing out at the gates and to guard the city that those citizens that were guilty and of the party opposite to the king might not get out of it Costobarus being sensible that the sons of Babas were had in re spect and honour by the whole multitude and supposing that their preservation might b of great advantage to him in the changes of government afterward he set them by themselves and concealed them in his own farms and when the thing was suspected he assured Herod upon oath that he really knew nothing of that matter and so overcame the suspicions that lay upon him nay after that when the king had publicly pro posed a reward for the discovery and had put in practice all sorts of methods for searching out this matter he would not confess it but being persuaded that when he had at first denied it if the men were found he should not escape unpunished he was forced to keep them secret not only out of his good will to them but out of a necessary regard to his own preservation also But when the king knew the thing by his sister s infor mation he sent men to the places where he had the intimation they were concealed and ordered both them and those that were accused as guilty with them to be slain insomuch that there were now none at all left of the kindred of Hyrcanus and the kingdom was entirely in Herod s own power and there was nobody remaining of such dignity as could put a stop to what he did against the Jewish laws CHAP VIII How ten men of he citizens of Jerusalem made a conspiracy against Herod for the foreign practices he had introduced which was a transgression of the laws of their country Con cerning the building ofSebaste and Cesarea and other edifices of Herod Â 1  N_this_iiccoiint it__was that Herod revolted from the laws of his country and corrupted their ancient constitution 361 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XV by the introduction of foreign practices which constitution yet ought to have been preserved inviolable by which means vre became guilty of great wickedness afterward while those re ligious observances which used to lead the multitude to piety were now neglected for in the first place he appointed so lemn games to be celebrated every fifth year in honour of Cae sar and built a theatre at Jerusalem as also a very great am phitheatre in the plain Both of them were indeed costly works but opposite to the Jewish customs for we have had no such shows delivered down to us as fit to be used or exhibited by us yet did he celebrate these games every five years in the most solemn and splendid manner He also made proclamation to the neighbouring countries and called men together out of every nation The wrestlers also and the rest of those that strove for the prizes in such games were invited out of every land both by the hopes of the rewards there to be bestowed and by the glory of victory to be there gained So the principal persons that were the most eminent in these sorts of exercises were gotten together for there were very great rewards for victory proposed not only to those that performed their exercises naked but to those that played the musicians also and were called Thy melici but he spared no pains to induce all persons the most famous for such exercises to come to this contest for victory He also promised no small rewards for those who ran for the prizes in chariot races when they were drawn by two or three or four pair of horses He also imitated every thing though never so costly or magnificent in other nations out of an am bition that he might give most public demonstration of his gran deur Inscriptions also of the great actions of Caesar and tro phies of those nations which he had conquered in his wars and tdl made of the purest gold and silver encompassed the theatre itself Nor was there any thing that could be subservient to his design whether it were precious garments or precious stones set in order which was not also exposed to sight in these games He had also made a great preparation of wild beasts and of lions themselves in great abundance and of such other beasts as were either of uncommon strength or of such a sort as were rarely seen These were prepared either to fight with one ano ther or that men who were condemned to death were to fight with them And truly foreigners were greatly surprised and delighted at the vastness of the expenses here exhibited and at the great dangers that were here seen  but to natural Jews  These grand plays and shows and thymelici or music meetings and chariot races when the chariots were drawn by two three or four pair of horses c insti tuted hy Herod in his theatres were still as we see here looked on by the sober Jews as heathenish sports and tending to corrupt the manners of the Jewish nation Chap VIII ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS S55 this was no better than a dissolution of those customs for which they had so great a veneration It appeared also no better than an instance of barefaced impiety to throw men to wild beasts for the affording delight to the spectators and it appealed an instance of no less impiety to change their own laws for such foreign exercises  but above all the rest the trophies gave most distaste to the Jews for as they imagined them to be images included within the armour that hung round about them they were sorely displeased at them because it was not the custom of their country to pay honours to such images 2 Nor was Herod unacquainted with the disturbance they were under and as he thought it unseasonable to use violence with them so he spoke tosome of them by way of consolation and in order to free them from that superstitious fear they were under yet could not he satisfy them but they cried out with one accord out of their great uneasiness at the offences they thought he had been guilty of that although they should think of bear ing all the rest yet would they never bear images of men in their city meaning the trophies because this was disagreeable to the laws of their country Now when Herod saw them in such a disorder and that they would not easily change their re solution unless they received satisfaction in this point he call ed to him the most eminent men among them and brought them upon the theatre and showed them the trophies and asked them what sort of things they took these trophies to be And when they cried out that they were the images of men he gave order that they should be stripped of these outward ornaments which were about them and showed them the naked pieces of wood  which pieces of wood now without any ornament became matter of great sport and laughter to them because they had be fore always had the ornaments of images themselves in derision 3 When therefore Herod had thus got clear of the multitude and had dissipated the vehemency of passion under which they had been the greatest part of the people were disposed to change their conduct and not to be displeased at him any longer but still some of them continued in their displeasure against him for his introduction of new customs and esteemed the violation of the laws of their country as likely to be the origin of very great mischiefs to them so that they deemed it an instance of piety rather to hazard themselves to be put to death than to seem and to bring them in love with Paganish idolatry and Paganish conduct of life but to the dissolution of the law of Moses and accordingly were greatly and justly con demned by them as appears here and every where else in Jcsephus Nor is the case of our modern masquerades plays operas and the like pomps and vanitiet of thii wicked world of any butter tendency under Christianity vou iI y Y 25 356 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XV as if they took no notice of Herod who upon the change he had made in their government introduced such customs and that in a violent manner which they had never been used to before as indeed in pretence a king but in reality one that showed himself an enemy to their whole nation on which account ten men that were citizens of Jerusalem conspired together against him and swore to one another to undergo any dangers in the attempt and took daggers with them under their garments for the purpose of killing Herod Now there was a certain blind man among those conspirators who had thus sworn to one another on account of the indignation he had against what he heard to have been done he was not indeed able to afford the rest any assistance in the undertaking but was ready to un dergo any suffering with them if so be they should come to any harm insomuch that he became a very great encourager of the rest of the undertakers 4 When they had taken this resolution and that by common consent they went into the theatre hoping that in the first place Herod himself could not escape them as they should fall upon him so unexpectedly and supposing however that if they mis sed him they should kill a great many of those that were about him and this resolution they took though they should die for it in order to suggest to the king what injuries he had done to the multitude These conspirators therefore standing thus pre pared beforehand went about their design with great alacrity but there was one of those spies of Herod s that were appointed for such purposes to fish out and inform him of any conspiracies that should be made against him who found out the whole affair and told the king of it as he was about to go into the theatre So when he reflected on the hatred which he knew the greatest part of the people bore him and on the disturbances that arose upon every occasion he thought this plot against him not to be improbable Accordingly he retired into his palace and call ed those that were accused of this conspiracy before him by their several names and as upon the guards falling upon them they were caught in the very fact and knew they could not es cape they prepared themselves for their ends with all the de cency they could and so as not at all to recede from their re solute behaviour for they showed no shame for what they were about nor denied it but when they were seized they showed their daggers and professed that the conspiracy they had sworn to was a holy and a pious action that what they in tended to do was not for gain or out of any indulgence to their passions but principally for those common customs of their country which all the Jews were obliged to observe or to die for them This was what these men said out of their Chap VIII ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 357 undaunted courage in this conspiracy So they were led away to execution by the king s guards that stood about them and patiently underwent all the torments inflicted on them till they died Nor was it long before that spy who had discovered them was seized on by some of the people out of the hatred they bore to him and was not only slain by them but pulled to pieces limb from limb and given to the dogs This execution was seei by many of the citizens yet would not one of them discovei the doers of it till upon Herod s making a strict scrutiny after them by bitter and severe tortures certain women that were tortured confessed whatthey had seen done the authors of which fact were so terribly punished by the king that their entire families were destroyed for this their rash attempt yet did not the obstinacy of the people and that undaunted constancy they showed in the defence of their laws make Herod any easier to them but he still strengthened himself after a more secure man ner and resolved to encompass the multitude every way lest such innovations should end in an open rebellion 5 Since therefore he had now the city fortified by the pa lace in which he lived and by the temple which had a strong fortress by it called Antonia and was rebuilt by himself he contrived to make Samaria a fortress for himself also against all the people and called it Sebaste supposing that this place would be a strong hold against the country not inferior to the former So he fortified that place which was a day s journey distant from Jerusalem and which would be useful to him in common to keep both the country and the city in awe He also built another fortress for the whole nation it was of old called Siiato s Tower but was by him named Caesarea Moreover he chose out some select horsemen and placed them in the great plain and built for them a place in Galilee called Gaba with He sebonitis in Perea And these were the places which he parti cularly built while he always inventing somewhat farther for his own secuiity and encompassing the whole nation with guards that they might by no means get from under his power nor fall into tumults which they did continually upon any small com motion and that if they did make any commotions he might know of it while some of his spies might be upon them from the neighbourhood and might both be able to know what they were attempting and to prevent it And when he went about building the wall of Samaria he contrived to bring thither many of those that had been assisting to him in his wars and many of the people in that neighbourhood also whom he made fellow citizens with the rest This he did out of an ambitious desire of building a temple and out of a desire to in ike the city more eminent than it hod been before but principally be 358 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XV cause he contrived that it might at once be for his own secu rity and a monument of his magnificence He also changed its name and called it Sebaste Moreover he parted the adjoin ing country which was excellent in its kind among the inhabi tants of Samaria that they might be in a happy condition upon their first coming to inhabit it Besides all which he encompas sed the city with a wall of great strength and made use of the acclivity of the place for making its fortifications stronger nor was the compass of the place made now so small as it had been before but was such as rendered it not inferior to the most fa mous cities for it was twenty furlongs in circumference Now within and about the niddle of it he built a sacred place of a furlong and a half in circuit and adorned it with all sorts of decorations and therein erected a temple which was il lustrious on account of both its largeness and beauty And as to the several parts of the city he adorned them with decora tions of all sorts also and as to what was necessary to provide for his own security he made the walls very strong for that purpose and made it for the greatest part a citadel and as to the elegance of the building it was taken care of also that he might leave monuments of the fineness of his taste and of his beneficence to future ages CHAP IX Concerning the famine that happened in Judea and Syria   and how Herod after he had married another wife rebuilt Cesa rea and other Grecian cities Â 1 JN ow on this very year which was the thirteenth year of the reign of Herod very great calamities came upon the country whether they were derived from the anger of God or  whether this misery returns again naturally in certain periods of time for in the first place there were perpetual droughts and for that reason the ground was barren and did not bring forth the same quantity of fruits that it used to produce and after this barrenness of the soil that change of food which the want of corn occasioned produced distempers in the bodies of men and a pestilential disease prevailed one misery following upon the back of another and the circumstances that they  Here we have an eminent example of the language of Josephus in his writing to Gentiles different from that when he wrote to Jews in his writing to whom he â till derives all such judgments from the anger of God but because he knew many of the Gentiles thought they might naturally come in certain periods he complies with them in the following sentence See the note on the War B I ch xxxiii sect 2 Vol III Chap IX ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Sh9 were destitute both of methods of cure and of food made the pestilential distemper which began after a violent manner the more lasting The destruction of men also after such a manner deprived those that survived of all their courage because they had no way to provide remedies sufficient for the distresses they were in Vhen therefore the fruits of that year were spoiled and whatsoever they had laid up beforehand was spent there was no foundation of hope for relief remaining but the misery con trary to what they expected still increased upon them and this not only at that year while they had nothing for themselves left at the end of it but what seed they had sown perished also by reason of the ground not yieldingits fruitson the  second year This distress they were in made them also out of necessity to eat many things that did not use to be eaten nor was the king him self free from this distress any more than other men as being deprived of that tribute he used to have from the fruits of the ground and having already expended what money he had in his liberality to those whose cities he had built nor had he any people that were worthy of his assistance since this miserable state of things had procured him the hatred of his subjects for it is a constant rule that misfortunes are still laid to the account of those that govern 2 In these circumstances he considered with himself how to procure some seasonable help but this was a hard thing to be done while their neighbours had no food to sell them and their money also was gone had it been possible to purchase a little food at a great price However he thought it his best way by all means not to leave off his endeavours to assist his people so he cut off the rich furniture that was in his palace both of silver and gold insomuch that he did not spare the finest vessels he had or those that were made with the most elaborate skill of the ai  tificers but sent the money to Petronius who had been made prefect of Egypt by Caesar and as not a few had already fled to him under their necessities and as he was particularly a friend to He  This famine that for two years affected Judea and Syria the 13th and 14th years of Herod which ave the 23d and 24th years before the Christian era seems to have been more terrible during this time than was that in the days of Jacob Gen xli xlii And what makes the comparison the more remarkable is this that now as well as then the relief they had was from Egypt also then from Joseph the governoi ot Egypt under Pharaoh king of Egypt and now from Petronius the prefect of Egypt under Augustus the Roman emperor See almost the like case Antiq B XX chap ii sect 6 vol III It is also well worth our observation here that these two years were a sabbatic year and a yÂ ar of jubilee for which Providence during the theocracy used to provide a treple crop beforehand but became now when the Jews had forfeited that blessing the greatest years of famine to them ever since the days of Ahab 1 Kings xvii xviii 560 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XV rod and desirous to have his subjects preserved he gave leave to them in the first place to export corn and assisted them every way both in purchasing and exporting the same so that he was the principal if not the only person who afforded them what help they had And Herod taking care the people should under stand that this help came from himself did thereby not only re move from him the ill opinion of those that formerly hated him but gave them the greatest demonstration possible of his good will to them and care of them for in the first place as for those who were able to provide their own food he distributed to them their proportion of corn in the exactest manner but for those many that were not able either by reason of their old age or any other infirmity to providefood for themselves hemadethis provision for them that the bakers should make the bread ready for them He also took care that they might not be hurt by the dangers of winter since they were in great want of clothing also by reason of the utter destruction and consumption of their sheep and goats till they had no wool to make use of nor any thing else to cover themselves withal And when he had pro cured these things for his own subjects he went farther in or der to provide necessaries for their neighbours and gave seed to the Syrians which thing turned greatly to his own advantage also this charitable assistance being afforded most seasonably to their fruitful soil so that every one had now a plentiful provi sion of food Upon the whole when the harvest of the land was approaching he sent no fewer than fifty thousand men whom he had sustained into the country by which means he both repair ed the afflicted condition of his own kingdom with great genero sity and diligence and lightened the afflictions of his neighbours who were under the same calamities for there was nobody who had been in want that was left destitute of a suitable assistance by him nay farther there were neither any people nor any cities nor any private men who were to make provision for the multitudes and on that account were in want of support and had recourse to him but received what they stood in need of in somuch that it appeared upon a computation that the number of cori of wheat often attick medimni a piece that were given to foreigners amounted to ten thousand and the number that was given in his own kingdom was about fourscore thousand Now it happened that this care of his and this seasonable bene faction had such influence on the Jews and was so cried up among other nations as to wipe off that old hatred which his vio lation of some of then customs during his reign had procured him among all the nation and that this liberality of his assistance in this their greatest necessity was full satisfaction for all that he had done of that nature as it also procured him great fame Chap IX ANTIgUTTIJiS OF THE JEWS 361 among foreigners and it looked as if these calamities that af flicted his land to a degree plainly incredible came in order to raise his glory and to be to his great advantage for the great ness of his liberality in these distresses which he now demonstrat ed beyond all expectation did so change the disposition of the multitude towards him that they were ready to suppose he had been from the beginning not such a one as they had found him to be by experience but such a one as the care he had taken of them in supplying their necessities proved him now to be 3 About this time it was that he sent five hundred chosen men out of the guards of his body as auxiliaries to Caesar whom  jElius Gallus led to the Red Sea and who were of great service to him there When therefore his affairs were thus improved and were again in a flourishing condition he built himself a pa lace in the upper city raising the rooms to a very great height and adorning them with the most costly furniture of gold and marble seats and beds and these were so large that they could contain very many companies of men These apartments were also of distinct magnitudes and had particular names given them for one apartment was called Caesar s another Agrippa s He also fell in love again and married another wife not suffering his reason to hinder him from living as he pleased The occa sion of thls his marriage was as follows There was one Simon a citizen of Jerusalem the son of one Boethus a citizen of Alex andria and a priest of great note there this man had a daughter who was esteemed the most beautiful woman of that time and when the people of Jerusalem began to speak much in her com mendation it happened that Herod was much affected with what was said of her and when he saw the damsel he was smitten with her beauty yet did he entirely reject the thoughts of using his authority to abuse her as believing what was the truth that by so doing he should be stigmatized for violence md tyranny so he thought it best to take the damsel to wife And while Simon was of a dignity too inferior to be allied to him but still too considerable to be despised he governed his inclinations after the most prudent manner by augmenting the dignity of the family and making them more honourable so he immediately deprived Jesus the son of Phabet of the high priest hood and conferred that dignity on Simon and so joined in af finity with him by marrying his daughter 4 When this wedding was over he built another citadel in  This TfUius Gallus seems to be no other than that JliuÂ Largus whom Dio speaks of as conducting an expedition that was about this time made into Arabia Felix according to Petavius who is here cited by Spanheim See a full account of this expedition in PridÂ aux at the years 23 and 24 S62 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JKWS Book XV that place where he had conquered the Jews when he was driven out of his government and Antigonus enjoyed it This citadel is distant from Jerusalem about threescore furlongs It was strong by nature and fit for such a building It is a sort of a moderate hill raised to a farther height by the hand of man till it was of the shape of a woman s breast It is encompassed with circular towers and hath a strait ascent up to it which ascent is composed of steps of polished stones in number two hundred Within it are royal and very rich apartments of a stucture that provided both for security and for beauty About the bottom thei e are habitations of such a structure as are well worth seeing both on other accounts and also on account of the water which is brought thitherfrom a great way off and at vastexpenses for the place itself is destitute of water The plain that is about this citadel is full of edifices not inferior to any city in large ness and having the hill above it in the nature of a castle 5 And now when all Herod s designs had succeeded accord ing to his hopes he had not the least suspicion that any troubles could arise in his kingdom because he kept his people obedient as well by the fear they stood in of him for he was implacable in the infliction of his punishments as by the provident care he had showed towards them after the most magnanimous manner when they were under their distresses But still he took care to have external security for his government as a fortress against his subjects for the orations he made to the cities were very fine and full of kindness and he cultivated a seasonable good under standing with their governors and bestowed presents on every one of them inducing them thereby to be more friendly to him and using his magnificent disposition so as his kingdom might be the better secured to him and this till all his affairs were every way more and more augmented But then this magnificent temper of his and that submissive behaviour and liberality which he exercised towards Caesar and the most powerful men of Rome obliged him to transgress the customs of his nation and to set aside many of their laws and by building cities after an extrava gant manner and erecting temples  not in Judea indeed for that  One may here take notice that how tyrannical and extravagant soever Herod was in himself and in his Grecian cities as to those plays and shows and temples tor idolatry mentioned above ch viii sect 1 and here also yet durst even he intro duce very few of them into the cities of ihe Jews who as Josephus here notes would not even then have borne them so zealous were they still for many of the la vs of Moses even under so tyrannical a government as this wasof Herod the Great which tyrannical government puts me naturally in mind of Dean Prideaux s honest reflection upon the like ambition after such tyrannical power in Pompey and Casar  One of these says he at the year GO could notEear an equal nor the other a superior and through Â this ambitious humour and thirxt after more power in these two men the Chap IX ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 363 would not have been borne it being forbidden for us to pay any honour to images or representations of animals after the man ner of the Greeks but still he did thus in the country properly out of our bounds and in the cities thereof The apology which he made to the Jews for these things was this that all was done not out of his own inclinations but by the commands and injunctions of the others in order to please Caesar and the Ro mans as though he had not the Jewish customs so much in his eye as he had the honour of those Romans while yet he had him self entirely in view all the while and indeed was very ambi tious to leave great monuments of his government to posterity whence it was that he was so zealous in building such fine cities and spent such vast sums of money upon them 6 Now upon his observation of a place near the sea which was very proper for containing a city and was before called Strato s Tower he set about getting a plan for a magnificent city there and erected many edifices with great diligence all over it and this of white stone He also adorned it with most sump tuous palaces and large edifices for containing the people and what was the greatest and most laborious work of all he adorned it with a haven that was always free from the waves of the sea Its largeness was not less than the Pyraeum at Athens and had towards the city a double station for the ships It was of excellent workmanship and this was the more remarkable for its being built in a place that of itself was not suitable to such noble structures but was to be brought to perfection by materials from other places and at very great expenses This city is situate in Phenicia in the passage by sea to Egypt be tween Joppa and Dora which are lesser maritime cities and not fit for havens on account of the impetuous south winds that beat upon them which rolling the sands that come from the sea against the shores do not admit of ships lying in their station but the merchants are generally there forced to ride at their anchors in the sea itself So Herod endeavoured to rectify this incon venience and laid out such a compass towards the land as might whole Roman empire being divided into two opposite factions there was pro duced hereby the most destructive war that ever afflicted it and the like folly too much reigns in all other places Could about thirty men be persuaded to Kve at home in peace without enterprising upon the right of each other for the vain glory of conquest and the enlargement of power the whole world might be at quiet but their ambition their follies and their humour leading  them constantly to encroach upon and quarrel with each other they involve all that are under them in the mischiefs thereof and many thousands are they which yearly perish by it so that it may almost raise a doubt whether the benefit which the world receives from government be sufficient to make amends for the calamities which it suiters from the follies mistakes and mal administrations of those that manage itÂ VOL II z z 27 364 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEW Book XV be sufficient for a haven wherein the great ships might lie in safety and this he effected by letting down vast stones of above fifty feet in length not less than eighteen in breadth and nine in depth into twenty fathom deep and as some were lesser so were others bigger than those dimensions This mole which he built by the sea side was two hundred feet wide the half of which was opposed to the current of the waves so as to keep off those waves which were to break upon them and so was called Procymatia or the first breaker of the waves but the other half had upon it a wall with several towers the largest of which was named Drusus and was a work of very great excellence and had its name from Drusus the son in law of Caesar who died young There were also a great number of arches where the mariners dwelt There were also before them a key or landing place which ran round the entire haven and was a most agreeable walk to such as had a mind to that exercise but the entrance or mouth of the port was made on the north quarter on which side was the stillest of the winds of all in this place and the basis of the whole circuit on the left hand as you enter the port sup ported a round turret which was made very strong in order to resist the greatest waves while on the right hand as you enter stood two vast stones and those each of them larger than the turret which was over against them these stood upright and were joined together Now there were edifices all along the circular haven made of the polished stone with a certain eleva tion whereon was erected a temple that was seen a great way off by those that were sailing for that haven and had in it two statues the one of Rome the other of Caesar As the city it self was called Caasarea which was also itself built of fine ma terials and was of a fine structure nay the very subterranean vaults and cellars had no less of architecture bestowed on them than had the buildings above ground Some of these vaults car ried things at even distances to the haven and to the sea but one of them ran obliquely and bound all the rest together that both the rain and the filth of the citizens were together carried off with ease and the sea itself upon the flux of the tide from without came into the city and washed it all clean Herod also built therein a theatre of stone and on the south quarter behind the port an amphitheatre also capable of holding a vast number of men and conveniently situated for a prospect to the sea So this city was thus finished in  twelve years  Cxsarea being here said to be rebuilt and adorned in twelve years and soon afterwards in ten years Antiq B XVI ch v sect 1 there must be a mistake in one of the places as to the true number but which of them it is hard positively to determine Chap X ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS SOS during which time the king did not fail to go on both with the work and to pay the charges that were necessary CHAP X How Herod sent his sons to Rome how also he was accused by Zenodorus and the Gadarens but was cleared of what they accused him of and withal gained to himself the good will of Ccesar Concerning the Pharisees the Essens and Manahem  1 W HEN Herod was engaged in such matters and when he had already re edified Sebaste Samaria he resolved to send his sons Alexander and Aristobulus to Rome to enjoy the company of Caesar who when they came thither lodged at the house of  Pollio who was very fond of Herod s friend ship and they had leave to lodge in Caesar s own palace for he received these sons of Herod with all humanity and gave Herod leave to give his kingdom to which of his sons he pleased and besides all this he bestowed on him Trachon and Batanea and Auranitis which he gave him on the occasion following One f Zenodorus had hired what was called the house of Lysa nias who as he was not satisfied with its revenues became a partner with the robbers that inhabited the Trachones and o procured himself a larger income for the inhabitants of those places lived in a mad way and pillaged the country of the Da mascenes while Zenodorus did not restrain them but partook of the prey they acquired Now as the neighbouring people were hereby great sufferers they complained to Varro who was then president of Syria and entreated him to write to Caesar about this injustice of Zenodorus When these matters were laid before Caesar he wrote back to Varro to destroy those nests of robbers and to give the land to Herod that so by his care the neighbouring countries might be no longer disturbed with these doings of the Trachonites for it was not an easy thing to restrain them since this way of robbery had been theu usual practice and they had no other way to get their living because they had neither any city of their own nor lands in their possession but only some receptacles and dens in the earth and there they and their cattle lived in common together However  This Pollio with whom Herod s sons lived at Rome was not Pollio the Phari see already mentioned by Josephus ch i sect 1 and again presently after this ch x sect 4 but Asinius Pollio the Roman as Spanheim here observes  The character of this Zenodorus is so like that of a famous robber of this same name in Strabo and that about this very country and about this very time also that I think Dr Hudson hardly needed to have put 3 perhaps to liis determination that they were the same 366 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XV they had made contrivances to get pools of water and laid up corn in granaries for themselves and were able to make great resistance by issuing out on the sudden against any that attacked them for the entrances of their caves were narrow in which but one could come in at a time and the places within incredibly large and made very wide but the ground over their habitations was not very high but rather on a plain while the rocks are altogether hard and difficult to be entered upon unless any one gets into the plain road by the guidance of another for these roads are not straight but have several revolutions But when these men are hindered from their wicked preying upon their neighbours their custom is to prey one upon another insomuch that no sort of injustice comes amiss to them But when Herod had received this grant from Caesar and was come into this country he procured skilful guides and put a stop to their wick ed robberies and procured peace and quietness to the neighbour ing people 2 Hereupon Zenodorus was grieved in the first place be cause his principality was taken away from him and still more so because he envied Herod who had gotten it so he went up to Rome to accuse him but returned back again without suc cess Now Agrippa was about this time sent to succeed Cae sar in the government of the countries beyond the Ionian sea upon whom Herod light when he was wintering about Mitylene for he had been his particular friend and companion and then returned into Judea again Jowever some of the Gadarens came to Agrippa and accused Herod whom he sent back bound to the king without giving them the hearing but still the Arabians who of old bare ill will to Herod s government were nettled and at that time attempted to raise a sedition in his do minions and as they thought upon a more justifiable occasion for Zenodorus despairing already of success as to his own af fairs prevented his enemies by selling to those Arabians a part of his principality called Auranitis for the value of fifty talents but as this was included in the donations of Caesar they contested the point with Herod as unjustly deprived of what they had bought Sometimes they did this by making incur sions upon him and sometimes by attempting force against him and sometimes by going to law with him Moreover they persuaded the poorer soldiers to help them and were trouble some to him out of a constant hope that they should seduce the people to raise a sedition in which designs those that are in the most miserable circumstances of life are still the most earnest and although Herod had been a great while apprized of these attempts yet did not he indulge any severity to them Chap X ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 367 but by rational methods aimed to mitigate things as not wil ling to give any handle for tumults 3 Now when Herod had already reigned seventeen years Cae sar came into Syria at which time the greatest part of the in habitants of Gadara clamoured against Herod as one that was heavy in his injunctions and tyrannical These reproaches they mainly ventured upon by the encouragement of Zenodorus who took his oath that he would never leave Herod till he had procured that they should be severed from Herod s kingdom and joined to Caesar s province The Gadarens were induced hereby and made no small cry against him and that the more boldly because those that had been delivered up by Agrippa were not punished by Herod who let them go and did them no harm for indeed he was the principal man in the world who appeared al most inexorable in punishing crimes in his own family but very generous in remitting the offences that were committed else where And while they accused Herod of injuries and plun derings and subversions of temples he stood unconcerned and was ready to make his defence However Caesar gave him his right hand and remitted nothing of his kindness to him upon this disturbance by the multitude and indeed these things were alleged the first day but the hearing proceeded no farther for as the Gadarens saw the inclination of Caesar and of his asses sors and expected as they had reason to do that they should be delivered up to the king some of them out of a dread of the torments they might undergo cut their own throats in the night time and some of them threw themselves down precipices and others of them cast themselves into the river and destroyed themselves of their own accord which accidents seemed a suffi cient condemnation of the rashness and crimes they had been guilty of whereupon Caesar made no longer delay but cleared He rod from the crimes he was accused of Another happy accident there was which was a farther great advantage to Herod at this time for Zenodorus belly burst and a great quantity of blood issued from him in his sickness and he thereby departed this life at Antioch in Syria so Caesar bestowed his country which was no small one upon Herod it lay between Trachon and Galilee and contained Ulatha and Paneas and the country round about He also made him one of the procurators of Syria and com manded that they should do every thing with his approbation and in short he arrived at that pitch of felicity that whereas there were but two men that governed the vast Roman empire first Caesar and then Agrippa who was his principal favourite Caesar preferred no one to Herod besides Agrippa and Agrippa made no one his greater friend than Herod besides Caesar And when he had acquired such freedom he begged of Caesar a te 368 ANTIgUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XV trarchy  for his brother Pheroras while he did himself bestow upon him a revenue of a hundred talents out of his own king dom that in case he came to any harm himself his brother might be in safety and that his sons might not have dominion over him So when he had conducted Caesar to the sea and was returned home he built him a most beautiful temple of the whitest stone in Zenodorus country near the place called Panium This is a very fine cave in a mountain under which there is a great ca vity in the earth and the cavern is abrupt and prodigiously deep and full of a still water over it hangs a vast mountain and un der the caverns arise the springs of the river Jordan Herod adorned this place which was already a very remarkable one still farther by the erection of this temple which he dedicated to Caesar 4 At which time Herod released to his subjects the third part of their taxes under pretence indeed of relieving them after the dearth they had had but the main reason was to recover their good will which he now wanted for they were uneasy at him because of the innovations he had introduced in their practices of the dissolution of their religion and of the disuse of their own cus toms and the people every where talked against him like those that were still more provoked and disturbed at his procedure against which discontents he greatly guarded himself and took away the opportunities they might have to disturb him and en joined them to be always at work nor did he permit the citi zens either to meet together or to walk or to eat together but watched every thing they did and when any were caught they were severely punished and many there were who were brought to the citadel Hyrcania both openly and secretly and were there put to death and there were spies set every where both in the city and in the roads who watched those that met together nay it is reported that he did not himself neglect this part of caution but that he would oftentimes himself take the habit of a private man and mix among the multitude in the night time and make trial what opinion they had of his government and as for those that could no way be reduced to acquiesce under his scheme of government he prosecuted them all manner of ways but for the rest of the multitude he required that they should be obliged to take an oath of fidelity to him and at the same time compelled them to swear that they would bear him good will and con tinue certainly so to do in his management of the government and indeed a great part of them either to please him or out of  A tetrarcky properly and originally denoted the fourth part of an entire kingdom or country and a tetrarch one that was a ruler of such a fourth part which

were of a more open and generous disposition and had indig nation at the force he used to them he by one means or other made away with them He endeavoured also to persuade Pollio the Pharisee and Sameas and the greatest part of their scholars to take the oath but these would neither submit so to do nor were they punished together with the rest out of the reve rence he bore to Pollio The Essens also as we call a sect of ours were excused from this imposition These men live the same kind of life as do those whom the Greeks call Pythagoreans concerning whom I shall discourse more fully elsewhere How ever it is but fit to set down here the reasons wherefore Herod had these Essens in such honour and thought higher of them than their mortal nature required nor will this account be unsuitable to the nature of this history as it will show the opinion men had of these Essens Now there was one of these Essens whose name was Ma nnhem who had this testimony that he not only conducted his life after an excellent manner but had the foreknowledge of fu ture events given him by God also This man once saw Herod when he was a child and going to school and saluted him as king of the Jews but he thinking that either he did not know him or that he was in jest put him in mind that he was but a private man but Manahem smiled to himself and clapped him on his backside with his hand and said  However that be thou wilt be king and wilt begin thy reign happily for God finds thee worthy of it And do thou remember the blows that Manahem hath given thee as being a signal of the change of thy fortune And truly this will be the reasoning for thee that thou love justice towards men and piety towards God and clemency towards thy citizens yet do I know how thy whole conduct will be that thou wilt not be such a one for thou wilt excel all men in happiness and obtain an everlasting reputation but wilt forget piety and righteousness and these crimes will not be concealed from God at the conclusion of thy life when thou wilt find that he will be mindful of them and punish thee for them Now at that time Herod did not at all attend to what Manahem said as having no hopes of such advancement but a little afterward when he was so fortunate as to be advanced to the dignity of king and was in the height of his dominion he sent for Manahem and asked him How long he should reign Manahem did not tell him the full length of his reign wherefore upon that silence of his he asked him farther Whether he should reign ten years or not he replied Yes twenty nay thirty years but did not assign the just determinate limit of his reign Herod was satisfied with these 870 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XV replies and gave Manahem his hand and dismissed him and from that time he continued to honour all the Essens We have thought it proper to relate these facts to our readers how strange soever they be and to declare what hath happened among us because many of the Essens have by their excellent virtue been thought worthy of his knowledge of divine revelations CHAP XI Haw Herod rebuilt the temple and raised it higher and made it more magnificent than it was before  as also concerning that tower which he called Antonia  1 AND now Herod in the eighteenth year of his reign and after the acts already mentioned undertook a very great work that is to build of himself the  temple of God and made it larger in compass and to raise it to a most magnificent altitude as esteeming it to be the most glorious of all his ac tions as it really was to bring it to perfection and this would be sufficient for an everlasting memorial of him but as he knew the multitude were not ready nor willing to assist him in so vast a design he thought to prepare them first by making a speech to them and then set about the work itself so he called them to gether and spake thus to them I think I need not speak to you my countrymen about such other works as I have done since I came to the kingdom although I may say they have been performed in such a manner as to bring more security to you than glory to myself for I have neither been negligent in the most difficult times about what tended to ease your ne cessities nor have the buildings I have made been so proper to preserve me as yourselves from injuries and I imagine that with God s assistance I have advanced the nation of the Jews to a degree of happiness which they never had before and for the particular edifices belonging to your own country and your own cities that we have lately acquired which we have erected and greatly adorned and thereby augmented the dig nity of your nation it seems to me a needless task to enume  We may here observe that the fancy of the modern Jews in calling this temple which was really the third of their temples the second temple follow ed so long by later Christians seems to be without any solid foundation The reason why the Christians here followed the Jews is because the prophecy of Haggai ii Câ 9 which they expound of ihe Messiah s coming to the second or Zorobabel s temple of which they suppose this of Herod s to be only a continua tion which is meant I think of his coming to the oÂ r A and last temple or to that future largest and most glorious one described by Ezekiel whence 1 take the former notion how general soever to be a great mistake See Lit Accomp of Troph p 24 Chap XI ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS S71 rate them to you since you well know them yourselves but as to that undertaking which 1 have a mind to set about at present and which will be a work of the greatest piety and excellence that can possibly be undertaken by us I will now declare it to you Our fathers indeed when they were return ed from Babylon built this temple to God Almighty yet does it want sixty cubits of its largeness in altitude for so much did that first temple which Solomon built exceed this temple nor let any one condemn our fathers for their negligence or want of piety herein for it was not their fault that the temple was no higher for they were Cyrus and Darius the son of Hystas pes who determined the measures for its rebuilding and it hath been by reason of the subjection of those fathers of ours to them and to their posterity and after them to the Macedo nians that they had not the opportunity to follow the origi nal model of this pious edifice nor could raise it to its ancient altitude but since I am now by God s will your governor and I have had peace a long time and have gained great rich es and large revenues and what is the principal thing of all I am at amity with and well regarded by the Romans who if I may so say are the rulers of the whole world I will do my endeavour to correct that imperfection which hath arisen from the necessity of our affairs and the slavery we have been under formerly and to make a thankful return after the most pious manner to God for what blessings I have received from him by giving me this kingdom and that by rendering his temple as complete as I am able 2 And this was the speech which Herod made to them  but still this speech affrighted many of the people as being unex pected by them and because it seemed incredible it did not en 1 courage them but put a damp upon them for they were afraid that he would pull down the whole edifice and not be able to bring his intentions to perfection for its rebuilding and this danger appeared to them to be very great and the vastness of the undertaking to be such as could hardly be accomplished But while they were in this disposition the king encouraged them and told them he would not pull down their temple till all things were gotten ready for building it up entirely again And as he promised them this beforehand so he did not break his word with them but got ready a thousand wag gons that were to bring stones for the building and chose out teti thousand of the most skilful workmen and brought a thou sand sacerdotal garments for as many of the priests and had some of them taught the arts of stone cutters and others of carpenters and then began to build but this not till every thing was well prepared for the work VOL 11 3 A 27 372 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XV 3 So Herod took away the old foundations and laid others and erected the temple upon them being in length a hundred cubits and in height twenty additional cubits which twenty upon the  sinking of their foundations fell down and this part it was that we resolved to raise again in the days of Nero Now the temple was built of stones that were white and strong and each of their length was twenty five cubits their height was eight and their breadth about twelve and the whole structure as was also the structure of the royal cloister was on each side much lower but the middle was much higher till they were visible to those that dwelt in the country for a great many fur longs but chiefly to such as lived over against them and those that approached to them The temple had doors also at the en trance and lintels over them of the same height with the tem ple itself They were adorned with embroidered vails with their flowers of pm pie and pillars interwoven and over these but under the crown work was spread out a golden vine with its branches hanging down from a great height the largeness and fine workmanship of which was a surprising sight to the specta tors to see what vast materials there were and with what great skill the workmanship was done He also encompassed the en tire temple with very large cloisters contriving them to be in a due proportion thereto and he laid out larger sums of money upon them than had been done before him till it seemed that no one else had so greatly adorned the temple as he had done There was a large wall to both the cloisters which wall was itself the most prodigious work that was ever heard of by man The hill was a rocky ascent that declined by degrees towards the east parts of the city till it came to an elevated level This hill it was which Solomon who was the first of our kings by divine revelation encompassed with a wall it was of excellent work manship upwards and round the top of it He also built a wall below beginning at the bottom which was encompassed by a  Some of our modern students in architecture have made a strange blunder here when they imagine that Joseph us affirms the entire foundation of the tempi or holy house sunk down into the rocky mountain on which it stood no less than 20 cubits whereas he is clear that they were the foundations of the ulduiimal 20 cubits only above the hundred made perhaps weak on purpose and only for show and grandeur that sunk or fell do vn as Dr Hudson rightly understands him nor is the thing itself possible in the other sense Agrippa s preparation for building the inner pans of the temple 20 cubits higher H istory of the War B V ch i stct 5 must in all probability refer to this matter since Josephus says here that this which had fallen down was designed to 1 craised up again under NeTO under whom Agrippa made that preparation But what Josejihus says presently that Solomon was the first king of the Jews appears by the paraltel place Amu B XX

rocks together and bound them one to another with lead and included some of the inner parts till it proceeded to a great height and till both the largeness of the square edifice and its altitude were immense and till the vastness of the stones in the front were plainly visi ble on the outside yet so that the inward parts were fastened to gether with iron and preserved the joints immoveable for all future times When this work for the foundation was done in this manner and joined together as part of the hill itself to the very top of it he wrought it all into one outward surface and filled up the hollow places which were about the wall and made it a level on the external upper surface and a smooth level also This hill was walled all round and in compass four furlongs the distance of each angle containing in length a fur long but within this wall and on the very top of all there ran another wall of stone also having on the east quarter a double cloister of the same length with the wall in the midst of which was the temple itself This cloister looked to the gates of the temple and it had been adorned by many kings in former times And round about the entire temple were fixed the spoils taken from barbarous nations all these had been dedicated to the temple by Herod with the addition of those he had taken from the Arabians 4 Now on the north side of the temple was built a citadel whose walls were square and strong and of extraordinary firmness This citadel was built by the kings of the Asamo nean race who were also high priests before Herod and they called it the Tower in which were reposited the vestments of the high priest which the high priest only put on at the time when he was to offer sacrifice These vestments king Herod kept in that place and after his death they were under the power of the Romans until the time of Tiberius Caesar under whose reign Vitellius the president of Syria when he once Came to Jerusalem and had been most magnificently received by the multitude he had a mind to make them some requital for the kindness they had showed him so upon their petition to have those holy vestments in their own power he wrote about them to Tiberius Caesar who granted his request and this their power over the sacerdotal vestments continued with the Jews till the death of king Agrippa but after that Cassius Longi nus who was president of Syria and Cuspius Fadus who was procurator of Judea enjoined the Jews to reposit those vest ments in the Tower of Antonia for that they ought to have them in their power as they formerly had However the Jews sent ambassadors to Claudius Caesar to intercede with him for them upon whose coming king Agrippa jun being then at Romer 374 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JBWS Book XV asked for ajid obtained the power over them from the emperor who gave command to Vitellius who was then commander in Syria to give it them accordingly Before that time they were kept under the seal of the high priest and of the treasurers of the temple which treasurers the day before a festival went up to the Roman captain of the temple guards and viewed their own seal and received the vestments and again when the festival was over they brought them to the same place and showed the captain of the temple guards their seal which cor responded with his seal and reposited them there And that these things were so the afflictions that happened to us after ward about them are sufficient evidence But for the tgvyer itself when Herod the king of the Jews had fortified it more firmly than before in order to secure and guard the temple he gratified Antonius who was his friend and the Roman ruler and then gave it the name of the Tower pf Antonia 5 Now in the western quarters of the enclosure of the tem ple there were four gates the first led to the king s palace and went o a passage over the intermediate valley two more led to the suburbs of the city and the last led to the other city where the roqd descended down info the valley by a great number of steps and thence up again by the ascent for the ity lay over against the temple in the manner of a theatre and was encompassed with a deep valley along the entire south quarter but the fourth front of the temple which was south ward had indeed itself gates in its middle as also it had the royal cloister with three walks which reached in length from the east valley unto that on the west for it was impossible it should reach any farther and this cloister deserves to be mentioned better than any other under the sun for while the valley was very deep and its bottom could not be seen if you looked from above into the depth this farther vastly high elevatioji of the cloister stood upon that height insomuch that if any one look ed down from the top of the battlements or down both those altitudes he would be giddy while his sight could not reach to such an immense depth This cloister had pillars that stood in four rows one over against the other all along for the fourth row was interwoven into the wall which also was built of stone and the thickness of each pillar was such that three men might with their arms extended fathom it round and join their hands again while its length was twenty seven feet with a double spiral at its basis and the number of all the piL lars in that court was a hundred and sixty two Their chap iters were made with sculptures after the Corinthian order and caused an amazement to the spectators by reason of the grandeur of the whole These four rows of pillars included Chap XI ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS three intervals for walking in the middle of this cloister two of which walks were made parallel to each other and were con trived after the same manner  the breadth of each of them was thirty feet the length was a furlong and the height fifty feet but the breadth of the middle part of the cloister was one and a half of the other and the heig ht was double for it was much higher than those on each side but the roofs were adorned with deep sculptures in wood representing many sorts of figures the middle was much higher than the rest and the wall of the front was adorned with beams resting upon pillars that were interwoven into it and that front was all of polished stone inT somuch that its fineness to such as had not seen it was incred ible and to such as had seen it was greatly amazing Thus was the first enclosure in the midst of which and not far from it was the second to be gone up to by a few steps this was encompassed by a stone wall for a partition with an inscription which forbade any foreigner to go in under pain of death Now this inner enclosure had on its southern and northern quarters three gates equally distant one from another but on the east quarter towards the sunrising there was one large gate through which such as were pure came in together with their wives but the temple farther inward in that gate was not allowed to the women but still more inward was there a third court of the temple whereinto it was not lawful for any but the priests alone to enter The temple itself was within this and before that temple was the altar upon which we offer our sacrifices and burnt offerings to God Into  none of these three did king Herod enter for he was forbidden because he was not a priest However he took care of the cloisters and the outer enclosures and these he built in eight years 6 But the temple itself was built by the priests in a year and six months upon which all the people were full of joy and presently they returned thanks in the first place to God and in the next place for the alacrity the king had showed They feasted and celebrated this rebuilding of the temple And for the king he sacrificed three hundred oxen to God as did the rest every one according to his ability the number of which sacrifices is not possible to be set down for it cannot be that we should truly relate it for at the same time with this celebra  Into none of these three Aid king Herod enter i e 1 Not into Ihe court of the priests 2 nor into the holy house itself 3 nor into the separate place be longing to the altar as the words following imply for none but priests or their attendants the Levites might come into any of them See Antiq B XVJ ch iv sect 6 when Herod goes into the temple and makes a speech in it to the peo ple but that could only be into

old custom as a festi val and it now coincided with the other which coincidence ot them both made the festival most illustrious 7 There was also an occult passage built for the king it led from Antonia to the inner temple at its eastern gate over which he also erected for himself a tower that he might have the op portunity of a subterraneous ascent to the temple in order to guard against any sedition which might be made by the people against their kings It is also  reported that during the time that the temple was building it did not rain in the daytime but that the showers fell in the night so that the work was not hindered And this our fathers have delivered to us nor is it incredible if any one have regard to the manifestations of God And thus was performed the work of the rebuilding of the temple  This tradition which Josephus here mentions as delivered down from fathers to their chitdren of this particular remarkable circumstance relating to the build ing of Herod s temple is a demonstration that such its building wns a known thing in Judea at that time He was born but 46 years after it is related to have been finished and might himself have seen and spoken wiih some of the builders themselves and with a great number of those that had seen it building The doubt therefore about the ruth of this history of the pulling down and rebuilding this temple by Horod which some weak people have indulged was not then much greater than it soon may be whether or not our St Paul s Church in London was burnt down in the fire of London A D 1666 and rebuilt by Sir Christopher Wren a little afterward Chap I ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS S77 BOOK XVI CONTAINING THE INTERVAL OF TWELVE YEARS FROM THE FINISHING OF THE TEMPLE BY HEROD TO THE DEATH OF ALEXANDER AND ARISTOBULUS J CHAP I A law of Herod about thieves Salome and Pheroras calum niate Alexander and Aristobulus upon their return from Rome for whom yet Herod provides wives Â 1 As king Herod was very zealous in the administration of his entire government and desirous to put a slop to particular acts of injustice which were clone by criminals about the city and country he made a law no way like our original laws and which he enacted of himself to expose housebreak ers to be ejected out of his kingdom which punishment was not only grievous to be borne by the offenders but contained in it a dissolution of the customs of our forefathers for this slavery to foreigners and such as did not live after the manner of Jews and this necessity that they were under to do whatsoever such men should command was an offence against our religious settlement rather than a punishment to such as were found to have offended such a punishment being avoided in our original laws for those laws ordain that the thief shall restore four fold and that if he have not so much he shall be sold indeed but not to foreigners nor so that he be under perpetual slavery for he must have been released after six years But this law thus enacted in order to introduce a severe and illegal punishment seemed to be a piece of insolence in Herod when he did not act as a king but as a tyrant and thus contemptuously and with out any regard to his subjects did he venture to introduce such a punishment Now this penalty thus brought into practice was like Herod s other actions and became a part of his accu sation and an occasion of the hatred he lay under 2 Now at this time it was that he sailed to Italy as very de sirous to meet with Caesar and to see his sons who lived at Rome and Caesar was not only very obliging to him in other respects but delivered him his sons again that he might take them home with him as having already completed themselves in the sci ences but as soon as tne young men were come from Italy the 578 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XVI multitude were very desirous to see them and they became con spicuous among them all as adorned with great blessings of for tune and having the countenances of persons of royal dignity So they soon appeared to be the objects of envy to Salome the king s sister and to such as had raised calumnies against Ma riamne for they were suspicious that when these came to the government they should be punished for the wickedness they had been guilty of against their mother so they made this very fear of theirs a motive to raise calumnies against them also They gave it out that they were not pleased with their father s company because he had put their mother to death as if it were not agreeable to piety to appear to converse with their mother s murderer Now by carrying these stories that had indeed a true foundation in the fact but were only built on probabil ities as to the present accusation they were able to do them mischief and to make Herod take away that kindness from his sons which he had before borne to them for they did not say these things to him openly but scattered abroad such words among the rest of the multitude from which words when car ried to Herod he was induced at last to hate them and which natural affection itself even in length of time was not able to overcome yet was the king at that time in a condition to pre fer the natural affection of a father before all the suspicions and calumnies his sons lay under So he respected them as he ought to do and married them to wives now they were of an age suitable thereto To Aristobulus he gave for a wife Berenice Salome s daughter and to Alexander Glaphyra the daughter of Archelaus king of Cappadocia CHAP II How Herod twice sailed to Agrippa and homo upon the com plaint of the Jews in Ionia against the Greeks Agrippa con firmed the laws of the Jews to them Â 1 WHEN Herod had despatched these affairs and he understood that Marcus Agrippa had sailed again out of Italy into Asia he made haste to him and besought him to come to him into his kingdom and to partake of what he might justly expect from one that had been his guest and was his friend This request he greatly pressed and to it Agrippa agreed and came into Judea whereupon Herod omitted nothing tliat might please him He entertained him in his new built cities and showed him the edifice he had built and provided all sorts of the best and most costly dainties for him and his friends and that at Sebaste and Cscsarea about that port that Chap II ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 879 he had built and at the fortresses which he had erected at great expense Alexandrium and Herodium and Hyrcania He also conducted him to the city Jerusalem where all the people met him in their festival garments and received him with acclama tions Agrippa also offered a hecatomb of sacrifices to God and feasted the people without omitting any of the greatest dainties that could be gotten He also took so much pleasure there that he abode many days with them and would willingly have staid longer but that the season of the year made him make haste away for as winter was coming on he thought it not safe to go to sea later and yet he was of necessity to return again to Ionia 2 So Agrippa went away when Herod had bestowed on him and on the principal of those that were with him many presents but king Herod when he had passed the winter in his own do minions made haste to get to him again in the spring when he knew he designed to go to a campaign at the Bosphorus So when he had sailed by Rhodes and by Cos he touched at Les bos as thinking he should have overtaken Agrippa there but he was taken short here by a northwind which hindered his ship from going to the shore so he continued many days at Chios and there he kindly treated a great many that came to him and obliged them by giving them royal gifts And when he saw that the portico of the city was fallen down which as it was overthrown in the Mithridatic war and was a very large and fine building so was it not so easy to rebuild that as it was the rest yet did he furnish a sum not only large enough for that purpose but what was more than sufficient to finish the build ing and ordered them not to overlook that portico but to re build it quickly that so the city might recover its proper orna ments And when the high winds were laid he sailed to Mity lene and thence to Byzantium and when he heard that Agrippa was sailed beyond the Cyanean rocks he made all the haste pos sible to overtake him and came up with him about Sinope in Pontus He was seen sailing by the shipmen most unexpectedly but appeared to their great joy and many friendly salutations there were between them insomuch that Agrippa thought he had received the greatest marks of the king s kindness and humanity towards him possible since the king had come so long a voyage and at a very proper season for his assistance and had left the government of his own dominions and thought it more worth his while to come to him Accordingly Herod was all in all to Agrippa in the management of the war and a great assistant in civil affairs and in giving him counsel as to parti cular matters He was also a pleasant companion for him when he relaxed himself and a joint partaker with him in all things VOL u SB 27 380 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XVI in troubles because of his kindness and in prosperity because of the respect Agrippa had for him Now as soon as those affairs of Pontus were finished for whose sake Agrippa was sent thither they did not think fit to return by sea but passed through Paphlagonia and Cappadocia they then travelled thence over great Phrygia and came to Ephesus and then they sailed from Ephesus to Samos And indeed the king bestowed a great many benefits on every city that he came to according as they stood in need of them for as for those that wanted either money or kind treatment he was not wanting to them but he supplied the former himself out of his own expenses he also became an intercessor with Agrippa for all such as sought after his favour and he brought things so about that the petitioners failed in none of their suits to him Agrippa being himself of a good disposition and of great generosity and ready to grant all such requests as might be advantageous to the petitioners pro vided they were not to the detriment of others The inclination of the king was of great weight also and still excited Agrippa who was himself ready to do good for he made a reconciliation between the people of Ilium at whom he was angry and paid what money the people of Chios owed Caesar s procurators and discharged them of their tributes and helped all others accord ing as their several necessities required 3 But now when Agrippa and Herod were in Ionia a great multitude of Jews who dwelt in their cities came to them and laying liold of the opportunity and the liberty now given them laid before them the injuries which they suffered while they were not permitted to use their own laws but were compelled to prosecute theif lawsuits by the ill usage of the judges upon their holy days and were deprived of the money they used to lay up at Jerusalem and were forced into the army and upon such other offices as obliged them to spend their sacred money from which burdens they always used to be freed by the Ro mans who had still permitted them to live according to their own laws When this clamour was made the king desired of Agrippa that he would hear their cause and assigned Nicolaus one of his friends to plead for those their privileges Accord ingly when Agrippa had called the principal of the Romans and such of the kings and rulers as we re there to be his asses sors Nicolaus stood up and pleaded for the Jews as follows It is of necessity incumbent on such as are in distress to have recourse to those that have it in their power to free them from those injuries they lie under and for those that now are complainants they approach you with great assurance for as they have formerly often obtained your favour so far as they have even wished to have it they now only entreat that you Chap II ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 381  who have been the donors will take care that those favours you have already granted them may not be taken away from them We have received these favours from you who alone have power to grant them but have them taken from us by such as are no greater than ourselves and by such as we know are as much subjects as we are and certainly if we have been vouchsafed great favours it is to our own com mendation who have obtained them as having been found deserving of such great favours and if those favours be but small ones it would be barbarous for the donors not to con firm them to us and for those that are the hinderance of the Jews and use them reproachfully it is evident that they af front both the receivers while they will not allow those to be worthy men to whom their excellent rulers themselves have borne their testimony and the donors while they desire those favours already granted may be abrogated Now if any one should ask these Gentiles themselves which of the two things they would choose to part with their lives or the customs of their forefathers their solemnities their sa orifices their festivals which they celebrated in honour of those they suppose to be gods I know very well that they would choose to suffer any thing whatsoever rather than a dissolution of any of the customs of their forefathers for a great many of them have rather chosen to go to war on that account as very solicitous not to transgress in those matters And indeed we take an estimate of that happiness which all mankind do now enjoy by your means from this very thing that we are allowed every one to worship as our own institu tions require and yet to live in peace and although they would not be thus treated themselves yet do they endeavour to compel others to comply with them as if it were not as great an instance of impiety profanely to dissolve the reli gious solemnities of any others as to be negligent in the obser vation of their own tov ards their gods And let us now con sider the one of these practices Is there any people or city or community of men to whom your government and the  Reman power does not appear to be the greatest blessing Is there any one that can desire to make void the favours they have granted No one is certainly so mad for there are no men but such as have been partakers of their favours both  public and private and indeed those that take away what  you have granted can have no assurance but every one of their own grants made them by you may be taken from them also which grants of yours can yet never be sufficiently valued for if they consider the old governments under kings 4 together with vour present government besides the great ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XVI number of benefits which this government hath bestowed on them in order to their happiness this is instead of all the rest that they appear to be no longer in a state of slavery but of freedom Now the privileges we desire even when we are in the best circumstances are not such as deserve to be en vied for we are indeed in a prosperous state by your means but this is only in common with others and it is no more than this which we desire to preserve our religion without any prohibition which as it appears not in itself a privilege to be envied us so it is for the advantage of those that grant it to us for if the divinity delights in being honoured he must delight in those that permit them to be honoured and there are none of our customs which are inhuman but all tending to piety and devoted to the preservation of justice nor do we conceal those injunctions of ours by which we govern our lives they being memorials of piety and of a friendly con versation among men And  the seventh day we set apart from labour it is dedicated to the learning of our customs and laws we thinking it proper to reflect on them as well as on any good thing else in order to our avoiding of sin If any one therefore examine into our observances he will find they are good in themselves and that they are ancient also though some think otherwise insomuch that those who have received them cannot easily be brought to depart from them out of that honour they pay to the length of time they have Ve ligiously enjoyed them and observed them Now our adver saries take these our privileges away in the way of injustice they violently seize upon that money of ours which is offered to God and called sacred money and this openly after a sa criligious manner and they impose tributes upon us and bring us before tribunals on holy days and then require other like debts of us not because the contracts require it or for their own advantage but because they would put an af  front on our religion of which they are conscious as well as we and have indulged themselves in an unjust and to them involuntary hatred for your government over all is one tending to the establishing of benevolence and abolishing of ill will among such as ate disposed to it This is therefore what we implore from thee most excellent Agrippa that we may not be ill treated that we may not be abused that we may not be hindered from making use of our own customs nor be despoiled of our goods nor be forced by these men to  We may here observe the ancient practice of the Jews of dedicating the Sab bath da not to idleness but to the learning their sacred rites and religious customs and to die meditation on the law of Moses The like to which we meet with else where in Jotephus also against A pion 6 I sect  22 Chap II ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 38S do what we ourselves force nobody to do for these privileges of ours are not only according to justice but have formerly been granted us by you And we are able to read to you many decrees of the senate and the tables that contain them which are still extant in the capitol concerning these things which it is evident were granted after you had experience of our fidelity towards you and which ought to be valued though no such fidelity had been for you have hitherto preserved what people were in possession of not to us only but almost to all men and have added greater advantages than they could have hoped for and thereby your government is become a great advantage to them And if any one were able to enu merate the benefits you have conferred on every nation which they possess by your means he could never put an end to his discourse but that we may demonstrate that we are not unworthy of all those advantages we have obtained it will be sufficient for us to say nothing of other things but to speak freely of this king who now governs us and is now one of thy assessors and indeed in what instance of good will as to your house hath he been deficient What mark of fidelity to it hath he omitted What token of honour hath he not devised What occasion for his assistance of you hath he not regarded at the very first What hindereth therefore but that your kindnesses may be as numerous as his so great benefits to you have been It may also perhaps be fit here not to pass over in silence the valour of his father Antipater who when Caesar made an expedition into Egypt assisted him with two thousand armed men and proved inferior to none neither in the battles on land nor in the management of the navy and what need I say any thing of how great weight those sol diers were at that juncture or how many and how great presents they were vouchsafed by Caesar And truly I ought before now to have mentioned the epistles which Caesar wrote to the senate and how Antipater had honours and the free dom of the city of Rome bestowed upon him for these are demonstrations both that we have received these favours by our own deserts and do on that account petition thee for thy confirmation of them from whom we had reason to hope for them though they had not been given us before both out of regard to our king s disposition towards you and your dispo sition towards him And farther we have been informed by those Jews that were there with what kindness thou came into our country and how thou offered the most perfect sa crifices to God and honoured him with remarkable vows and how thou gave the people a feast and accepted of their own hospitable presents to thee We ought to esteem all these 38 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XVI kind entertainments made both by our nation and our city to a man who is the ruler and manager of so much of the pub lie affairs as indications of that friendship which thou hast re turned to the Jewish nation and v hich hath been procured them by the family of Herod So we put thee in mind of these things in the presence of the king now sitting by thee and make our request for no more but this that what you have  given us yourselves you will not see taken away by others from us 5 When Nicolaus had made this speech there was no oppo sition made to it by the Greeks for this was not an inquiry made as in a court of justice but an intercession to prevent violence to be offered to the Jews any longer nor did the Greeks make any defence of themselves or deny what it was supposed they had done Their pretence was no more than this that while the Jews inhabited in their country they were entirely unjust to them in not joining in their worship but they de monstrated their generosity in this that though they worship ped according to their own institutions they did nothing that ought to grieve them So when Agrippa perceived that they had been oppressed by violence he made this answer That on account of Herod s good will and friendship he was ready to grant the Jews whatsoever they should ask him and that their requests seemed to him in themselves just and that if they requested any thing farther he should not scruple to grant it them provided it was no way to the detriment of the Roman government but that while their request was no more than this that what privileges they had already gi ven them might not be abrogated he confirmed this to them that they might continue in the observation of their own cus toms without any one s offering them the least injury And when he had said this he dissolved the assembly upon which Herod stood up and saluted him and gave him thanks for the kind disposition he showed to them Agrippa also took this in a very obliging manner and saluted him again and embraced him in his arms after which he went away from Lesbos but the king determined to sail from Samos to his own country and when he had taken his leave of Agrippa he pursued his voyage and landed at Caesarea in a few days time as having fa vourable winds from whence he went to Jerusalem and there gathered all the people together to an assembly not a few being there out of the country also So he came to them and gave them a particular account of all his journey and of the af fairs of all the Jews in Asia how by his means they would live without injurious treatment for the time to come He also told them of the entire good fortune he had met vith and how he Chap III ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 385 had administered the government and had not neglected any thing which was for their advantage and as he was very joyful he now remitted to them the fourth part of their taxes for the last year Accordingly they were so pleased with his favour and speech to them that they went their ways with great glad ness and wished the king all manner of happiness CHAP III How great disturbances arose in Herod s family on his preferring Antipater his eldest son before the rest till Alexander took that injury very heinously Â 1 JJUT now the affairs in Herod s family were m more disorder and became more severe upon him by the hatred of Salome to the young men Alexander and Aristobulus which descended as it were by inheritance from their mother Mariamne And as she had fully succeeded against their mother so she proceeded to that degree of madness and inso lence as to endeavour that none of her posterity might be left alive who might have it in their power to revenge her death The young men had also somewhat of a bold and uneasy disposi tion towards their father occasioned by the remembrance of what their mother had unjustly suffered and by their own affec tation of dominion The old grudge was also renewed and they cast reproaches on Salome and Pheroras who requited the young men with malicious designs and actually laid treacherous snares for them Now as for this hatred it was equal on both sides but the manner of exerting that hatred was different for as for the young men they were rash reproaching and affront ing the others openly and were unexperienced enough to think it the most generous to declare their minds in that undaunted manner but the others did not take that method but made use of calumnies after a subtle and a spiteful manner still provok ing the young men and imagining that their boldness might in time turn to the offering violence to their father for inasmuch as they were not ashamed of the pretended crimes of their mother nor thought she suffered justly these supposed that it might al length exceed all bounds and induce them to think they ought to be ivenged on their father though it were by despatching him with their own hands At length it came to this that the whole city was full of their discourses and as is usual in such contests the unskilfulness of the young men was pitied but the contrivance of Salome was too hard for them and what impu tations she laid upon them came to be believed by means of their own conduct for they who were so deeply affected with S86 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XVI the death of their mother that while they said both she and themselves were in a miserable case they vehemently complain ed of her pitiable end which indeed was truly such and said that they were themselves in a pitiable case also because they were forced to live with those that had been her murderers and to be partakers with them 2 These disorders increased greatly and the king s absence abroad had afforded a fit opportunity for that increase but as soon as Herod was returned and had made the forementioned speech to the multitude Pheroras and Salome let fall words im mediately as if he were in great danger and as if the young men openly threatened that they would not spare him any longer but revenge their mother s death upon him They also added another circumstance that their hopes were fixed on Arche laus the king of Cappadocia that they should be able by his means to come to Caesar and accuse their father Upon hearing such things Herod was immediately disturbed and indeed was the more astonished because the same things were related to him by some others also He then called to mind his former calamity and considered that the disorders in his family had hindered him from enjoying any comfort from those that were dearest to him or from his wife whom he loved so well and suspecting that his future troubles would soon be heavier and greater than those that were past he was in great confusion of mind for divine providence had in reality conferred upon him a great many outward advantages for his happiness even be yond his hopes but the troubles he had at home were such as he never expected to have met with and rendered him unfortu nate nay both sorts came upon him to such a degree as no one could imagine and made it a doubtful question whether upon the comparison of both he ought to have exchanged so great a success of outward good things for so great misfortunes at home or whether he ought not to have chosen to avoid the calamities relating to his family though he had for a compensation never been possessed of the admired grandeur of a kingdom 3 As he was thus disturbed and afflicted in order to depress these young men he brought to court another of his sons that was born to him when he was a private man his name was Antipater  yet did he not then indulge him as he did afterwards when he was quite overcome by him and let him do every thing as he pleased but rather with a design of depressing the insolence of the sons of Mariamne and managing this elevation of his so that it might be for a warning to them for this bold behaviour of theirs he thought would not be so great if they were once persuaded that the succession to the kingdom did not appertain to them alone or must of necessity come to them So he intro Chap III ANTIQUITIES OP THE JEWS 397 duced Antipater as their antagonist and imagined that he made a good provision for discouraging their pride and that after this was done to the young men there might be a proper season for expecting these to be of a better disposition But the event proved otherwise than he intended for the young men thought he did them a very great injury and as Antipater was a shrewd man when he had once obtained this degree of freedom and began to expect greater things than he had before hoped for he had but one single design in his head and that Was to distress his bre thren and not at all to yield to them the pre eminence but to keep close to his father who was already alienated from them by the calumnies he had heard about them and ready to be wrought upon in any way his zeal against them should advise him to pursue that he might be continually more and morese vere against them Accordingly all the reports that were spread abroad came from him while he avoided himself the suspicion of those discoveries proceeding from him for he rather chose to make use of those persons for his assistants that were unsuspected and such as might be believed to speak truth by reason of the good will they bore to the king and indeed there were already not a few who cultivated a friendship with Antipater in hopes of gaining somewhat by him and these were the men who most of all persuaded Herod because they appeared to speak thus out of their good will to him and while these joint accusations which from various foundations supported one another s veracity the young men themselves afforded farther occasions to An tipater also for they were observed to shed tears often on ac count of the injury that was offered them and had their mother in their mouths and among their friends they ventured to re proach their father as not acting justly by them all which things were with an evil intention reserved in memory by An tipater against a proper opportunity and when they were told to Herod with aggravations increased the disorder so much that  it brought a great tumult into the family for while the king was very angry at imputations that were laid upon the sons of Mariam ne and was desirous to humble them he still increased the honour that he had bestowed on Antipater and was at last so overcome by his persuasions that he brought his mother to court also He also wrote frequently to Caesar in favour of him and more earnestly recommended him to his particular care And when Agrippa was returning to Rome after he had finished his ten  years government in Asia Herod sailed fromJudea ami when he met with him he had none with him but Antipater  This interval of ten years for die duration of Marcus Agrippa s government in Asia seems to be true and agreeable to the Roman liiitory See Usher s Annals It A M 1392 vpL iI 3 C 2 388 iimgoiTiES OF THE JEWS Book XVI whom he delivered to Agrippa that he might take him along with him together with many presents that so he might be come Caesar s friend insomuch that things already looked as if he had all his father s favour and that the young men were entirely rejected from any hopes of the kingdom CHAP IV How during Antipater s abode at Home Herod brought Alex ander and Aristobulus before C sar and accused them Alex ander s defence of himself before Caesar and reconciliation to hisfather Â 1 AND now what happened during Antipater s absence augmented the honour to which he had been promoted and his apparent eminence above his brethren for he had made a great figure in Rome because Herod had sent recommendations of him to all his friends there only he was grieved that he was not at home nor had proper opportunities of perpetually calum niating his brethren and his chief fear was lest his father should alter his mind and entertain a more favourable opinion of the sons of Mariamne and as he had this in his mind he did not desist from his purpose but continually sent from Rome any such stories as he hoped might grieve and irritate his father against his brethren under pretence indeed of a deep concern for his preservation but in truth such as his malicious mind dictated in order to purchase a greater hope of the succession which yet was already great in itself and thus he did till he hadexcitedsuch a degree of anger in Herod that he was already become very ill disposed towards the young men but still while he delayed to exercise so violent a disgust against them and that he might not either be too remiss or too rash and so offend he thought it best to sail to Rome and there accuse his sons before Caesar and not indulge himself in any such crime as might be heinous enough to be suspected of impiety but as he was going up to Rome it happened that he made such haste as to meet with Caesar at the  city Aquilei So when he came to the speech of Caesai he ask ed for a time for hearing this great cause wherein he thought  Although Herod met Augustus at Aquilei yet was this accusation of his sons deferred till they came to Rome as sect 3 assures and as we are particularly in formed in the history of the War B I ch xxiii sect 3 voL III though what he here says belonged distinctly to Alexander the elder brother I mean his being brought to Rome is here justly extended to both the brothers and that not only in our copies but that in Zonoras also nor is there reason to doubt but they were both at this solemn hearing of Augustus although the defence was made by Alexander lone who was the eldest brother and one that could speak very well Chap IV ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 389 himself very miserable and presented his sons there and accus ed them of their mad actions and of their attempts against him That  they were enemies to him and by all the means they were able did their endeavours to show their hatred to their own father and would lake away his life and so obtain his king dom after the most barbarous manner that he had power from Caesar to dispose of it not by necessity but by choice to him who shall exercise the greatest piety towards him while these my sons are not so desirous of ruling as they are upon a disappointment thereof to expose their own life if so be they may but deprive their father of his life so wild and pollu ted is their mind by time become out of their hatred to him that whereas he had a long time borne this his misfortune he was now compelled to lay it before Caesar and to pollute his ears with such language while he himself wants to know what severity they have ever suffered from him or what hardships he hath ever laid upon them to make them com plain of him and how they can think it just that he should not be lord of that kingdom which he in a long time and with great danger had gained and not allow him to keep it and dispose of it to him who should deserve it best  and this with other advantages he proposes as a reward for the piety of such a one as will hereafter imitate the care he hath taken of it and that such a one may gain so great a requittal as that is and that it is an impious thing for them to pretend to meddle with it beforehand for he who hath ever the king dom in his view at the same time reckons upon procuring the death of his father because otherwise he cannot come at the government that as for himself he had hitherto given them all that he was able and what was agreeable to such as are subject to the royal authority and the sons of a king what ornaments they wanted with servants and deli cate fare and had married them into the most illustrious families the one Aristobulus to his sister s daughter but Alexander to the daughter of king Archelaus and what was the greatest favour of all when their crimes were so very bad and he had authority to punish them yet had he not made use of it against them but had brought them before Caesar their common benefactor and had not used the severity which either as a father who had been impiously abused or as a king who had been assaulted treacherously he might have done he made them stand upon the level with him in judg ment that however it was necessary that all this should not be passed over without punishment nor himself live in the greatest fears nay that it was not for their own advantage to see the light of the sun after what they have done although they should escaue at this time since they had done 590 ANTIQUITIES or THE JEWS Bodk XVI the vilest things and would certainly suffer the greatest pun ishments that were ever known among mankind 2 These were the accusations which Herod laid with great vehemency against his sons before Caesar Now the young men both while he was speaking and chiefly at his concluding wept and were in confusion For as to themselves they knew in their own consciences they were innocent but because they were accused by their father they were sensible as the truth was that it was hard for them to make their apology since though they were at liberty to speak their minds freely as the occasion required and might with force and earnestness refute the accusa tion yet was it not now decent so to do There was therefore a difficulty how they should be able to speak and tears and at length a deep groan followed while they were afraid that if they said nothing they should seem to be in this difficulty from a consciousness of guilt nor had they any defence ready by rea son of their youth and the disorder they were under yet was not Caesar unapprised when he looked upon them in the con fusion they were in that their delay to make their defence did not arise from any consciousness of great enormities but from their unskilfulness and modesty They were also commiserated by those that were there in particular and they moved their fa ther s affections in earnest till he had much ado to conceal them 3 But when they saw there was a kind disposition arisen both in him and in Caesar and that every one of the rest did either shed tears or at least did all grieve with them the one of them whose name was Alexander called to his father and attempted to answer his accusation and said  O father the benevolence thou hast showed to us is evident even in this very judicial proce dure for hadst thou had any pernicious intentions about us thou hadst not produced us here before the common saviour of all for it was in thy power both as a king and as a father to punish the guilty but by thus bringing us to Rome and mak ing Caesar himself a witness to what is done thou intimatest that thou intendest to save us for no one that hath a design to slay a man will bring him to the temples and to the altars yet are our circumstances still worse for we cannot endure to live ourselves any longer if it be believed that we have injur ed such a father nay perhaps it would be worse for us to live with this suspicion upon us that we have injured him than to die without such guilt and if our open defence may be taken to be true we shall be happy both in pacifying thee and in escaping the danger we are in but if this calumny so prevails it is more than enough for us that we have seen the sun this day  which why should we see if this suspicion be fixed upon us Now it is easy to say of young men that they Chap IV ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 891 desire to reign and to say farther that this evil proceeds from the case of our unhappy mother This is abundantly sufficient to produce our misfortune out of the former but consider well whether such an accusation does not suit all such young men and may not be said of them all promiscuously for nothing can hinder him that reigns if he have children and their mother be dead but the father may have a suspicion upon all his sons as intending some treachery to him but a sus picion is not sufficient to prove such an impious practice Now let any man say whether we have actually and insolently at tempted any such thing whereby actions otherwise incredible use to be made credible Can any body prove that poison hath been prepared or prove a conspiracy of our equals or the corruption of servants or letters written against thee though indeed there are none of those things but have some times been pretended by way of calumny when they were never done for a royal family that is at variance with itself is a terrible thing and that which thou callest a reward of piety often becomes among very wicked men such a founda tion of hope as makes them leave no sort of mischief untried Nor does any one lay any wicked practices to our charge but to calumnies by hearsay how can he put an end to them who will not hear what we have to say Have we talked with too great freedom yes but not against thee for that would be unjust but against those that never conceal any thing that is spoken to them Hath either of us lamented our mother yes but not because she is dead but because she was evil spoken of by those who had no reason so to do Are we desirous of that dominion which we know our father is pos sessed of For what reason can we be so If we already have royal honours as we have should not we labour in vain And if we have them not yet are not we in hopes of them Or supposing that we had killed thee could we expect to ob tain thy kingdom while neither the earth would let us tread upon it nor the sea let us sail upon it after such an action as that nay the religion of all your subjects and the piety of the whole nation would have prohibited parricides from as suming the government and from  entering into that most  Since some prejudiced men have indulged a wild suspicion as we have sup posed already Antiq B XV ch xi seet 7 that Josephus history of Herod s rebuilding the temple is no better than a fable it may not be amiss to take notice of the occasional clause in the speed of Alexander before his father Herod in his and his brother s vindication which mentions the temple as known by every body to have been built by Herod See John ii 20 See also another speech of Herod s

per haps more unfortunate than is convenient for thee But in case thou neither findest any causes of complaint nor any treacherous designs what sufficient evidences hast thou to make such a wickedness of ours credible Our mother is dead in deed but then what befell her might be an instruction to us to caution and not an incitement to wickedness We are  willing to make a larger apology for ourselves but actions never done do not admit of discourse Nay we will make this agreement with thee and that before Caesar the lord of all who is now a mediator between us If thou O father canst bring thyself by the evidence of truth to have a mind free from suspicion concerning us let us live though even then we shall live in an unhappy way for to beaccusedof greatactsof wicked ness though falsely is a terrible thing but if thou hast any fear remaining continue thou on in thy pious life we will give this reason for our own conduct our life is not so de sirable to us as to desire to have it if it tend to the harm of our father who gave it us 4 When Alexander had thus spoken Caesar who did not be fore believe so gross a calumny was still more moved by it and looked intently upon Herod and perceived he was a little con founded the persons there present were under an anxiety about the young men and the fame that was spread abroad made the king hated for the very incredibility of the calumny and the Gommiseration which the flower of youth the beauty of body which were in the young men pleaded for assistance and the more so on this account that Alexander had made their de fence with dexterity and prudence nay they did not themselves any longer continue in their former countenances which had been bedewed with tears and cast downwards to the ground but now there arose in them a hope of the best and the king himself appeared not to have had foundation enough to build such an accusation upon he having no real evidence wherewith to con vict them Indeed he wanted some apology for making the ac cusation but Caesar after some delay said That although the young men were thoroughly innocent of that for which they were calumniated yet had they been so far to blame that they had not demeaned themselves towards their father so as to prevent that suspicion which was spread abroad concerning him a vast sum and that the Asamoneans in those 125 years they held the government were not able to perform so great a work to the honour of God at this was Antiq B XVII ch vi sect 3 vol HI Chap IV ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS S9S them He also exhorted Herod to lay all such suspicions aside and to be reconciled to his sons for that it was not just to give any credit to such reports concerning his own children and that this repentance on both sides might still heal those breaches that had happened between them and might improve their good will to one another whereby those on both sides excusing the rashness of their suspicions might resolve to bear a greater degree of affection towards each other than they had before Af ter Caesar had given them this admonition he beckoned to the young men When therefore they were disposed to fall down to make intercession to their father he took them up and em braced them as they were in tears and took each of them dis tinctly in his arms till not one of those that were present whether freeman or slave but was deeply affected with what they saw 5 Then did they return thanks to Caesar and went away together and with them went Antipater with a hypocritical pretence that he rejoiced at this reconciliation And in the last days they were with Caesar Herod made him a present of three hundred talents as he was then exhibiting shows andjargesses to the people of Rome and Caesar made him a present of half the revenue of the copper mines in Cyprus and committed the care of the other half to him and honoured him with other gifts and incomes And as to his own kingdom he left it in his own power to appoint which of his sons he pleased for his successor or to distribute it in parts to every one that the dignity might thereby come to them all And when Herod was disposed to make such a settlement immediately Caesar said He would not give him leave to deprive himself while he was alive of the power over his kingdom or over his sons 6 After this Herod returned to Judea again but during his absence no small part of his dominions about Trachon had re volted whom yet the commanders he left there had vanquished and compelled to a submission again Now as Herod was sail ing with his sons and was come over against Cilicia to the island Eleusa which hath now changed its name for Sebaste he met with Archelaus king of Cappadocia who received him kindly as rejoicing that he was reconciled to his sons and that the accasation against Alexander who had married his daugh ter was at an end They also made one another such presents as it became kings to make From thence Herod came to Judea and to the temple where he made a speech to the people con cerning what had been done in this his journey  He also dis coursed to them about Caesar s kindness to him and about as many of the particulars he had done as he thought it for his advantage other people should be acquainted with At last he 394 ANTIO UITIES or THE JEWS Book XVI turned his speech to the admonition of his sons and exhorted those that lived at court and the multitude to concord and informed them that his sons were to resign after him Anti pater first and then Alexander and Aristobulus the sons of Mariamne but he desired that at present they should all have regard to himself and esteem him king and lord of all since he was not yet hindered by old age but was in that period ot life when he must be the most skilful in governing and that he was not deficient in other arts of management that might enable him to govern the kingdom well and to rule over his children also He farther told the rulers under him and the soldiery that in case they would look upon him alone their life would be led in a peaceable manner and they would make one another happy And when he had said this he dismissed the assembly Which speech was acceptable to the greatest part of the audience but not so to them all for the contention among his sons and the hopes he had given them occasioned thoughts and desires of innovations among them CHAP V How Herod celebrated the games that were to return every Jifth year upon the building of Ccesarea   and hem he built and adorned many other places after a magnificent manner and did many other actions gloriously Â 1 ABOUT this time it was that Caesarea Sebaste which he had built was finished The entire building being accomplish ed in the tenth year the solemnity of it fell into the twenty eight year of Herod s reign and into the hundred and ninety second olympiad There was accordingly a great festival and most sumptuous preparations made presently in order to its dedication for he had appointed a contention in music and games to be performed naked He had also gotten ready a great number of those that fight single combats and of beasts lor the like purpose horse races also and the most chargeable of such sports and shows as used to be exhibited at Rome and in other places He consecrated this combat to Caesar and or dered it to be celebrated every fifth year He also sent all sorts of ornaments for it out of his own furniture that it might want nothing to make it decent nay Julia Caesar s wife sent a great part of her most valuable furniture from Rome insomuch that he had no want of any thing The sum of them all was esti mated at five hundred talents Now when a great multitude was come to that city to see the shows as well as the ambassadors whom other people sent on account of the benefits they had re Chap V ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 395 oeived from Herod he entertained them all in the public inns and at public tables nnd with perpetual feasts this solemnity having in the day time the diversions of the fights and in the night time such merry meetings as cost vast sums of money and publicly demonstrated the generosity of his soul fof in ail his undertakings he was ambitious to exhibit what exceeded whatsoever had been done before of the same kind And it is related that Caesar and Agrippa often said That  the dominions of Herod were too little for the greatness of his soul for thai he deserved to have both all the kingdom of Syria and that of Egypt also 2 After this solemnity and these festivals were over Herod erected another city in the plain called Capharsaba where he chose out a fit place both for plenty of water and goodness of soil and proper for the production of what was there planted where a river encompassed the city itself and a grove of the best trees for magnitude was round nbflut it this he named An tipatris from his father Antipater He also built upon another spot of ground above Jericho of the same name with his mo ther a place of great security and very pleasant for habitation and called it Cyprus He also dedicated the finest monuments to his brother Phasaelus on account of the great natural affec tion there had been between them by erecting a tower in the city itself not less than the tower of Pharos which he named Phasaelus which was at once a part of the strong defences of the city and a memorial for him that was deceased because it bore his name He also built a city of the same name in the valley of Jericho as you go from it northward whereby he rendered the neighbouring country more fruitful by the cultivation its inhabitants introduced and this also he called Phasaelus 3 But as for his other benefits it is impossible to reckon them up those which he bestowed on cities both in Syria and in Greece and in all the places he came to in his voyages for he seems to have conferred and that after a most plentiful manner what would minister to many necessities and the building of public works and gave them the money that was necessary to such works as wanted it to support them upon the failure of their other revenues but what was the greatest and most il lustrious of all his works he erected Apollo s temple at Rhodes at his own expenses and gave them a great number of talents of silver for the repair of their fleet He also built the greatest part of the public edifices for the inhabitants of  Nicopolis  Dr Hudson here gives us the words of Suetonius concerning this Nieopolis when Agustus rebuilt it And that the memory of the victory at Actium might be celebrated the more afterward he built NicopolUat Actium and appointed pub lie shows to be ilmrc exhibited every tifth year in August Sect 18 VOL iI 3D 27 396 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XVI at Actium and for the Antiochians the inhabitants of the principal city in Syria where a broad street cuts through the place lengthways he built cloisters along it on both sides and laid the open road with polished stone and was of very great advantage to the inhabitants And as to the Olympic games which were in a very low condition by reason of the failure of their revenues he recovered their reputation and appointed re venues for their maintenance and made that solemn meeting more venerable as to the sacrifices and other ornaments and by reason of this vast liberality he was generally declared in their inscriptions to be one of the perpetual managers of those games 4 Now some there are who stand amazed at the diversity of Herod s nature and purposes for when we have respect to his magnificence and the benefits which he bestowed on all mankind there is no possibility for even those that had the least respect for him to deny or not openly to confess that he had a nature vastly beneficent but when any one looks upon the punishments he inflicted and the injuries he did not only to his subjects but to his nearest relations and takes notice of his severe and unrelent ing disposition there he will be forced to allow that it was brut ish and a stranger to all humanity insomuch that these men suppose his nature to be different and sometimes at contradic tion with itself but 1 am myself of another opinion and ima gine that the occasion of both these sort of actions was one and the same for being a man ambitious of honour and quite over come by that passion he was induced to be magnificent where ever there appeared any hopes of a future memorial or of re putation at present and as his expenses were beyond his abili ties he was necessitated to be harsh to his subjects for the per sons on whom he expended his money were so many that they made him a very bad procurer of it and because he was con scious that he was hated by those under him for the injuries he did them he thought it not an easy thing to amend his offences for that it was convenient for his revenue he therefore strove on the other side to make their ill will an occasion of his gains As to his own court therefore if any one was not very obsequious to him in his language and would not confess himself to be his slave or but seemed to think of any innovation in his govern ment he was not able to contain himself but prosecuted his very kindred and friends and punished them as if they were ene mies and this wickedness he undertook out of a desire that he might be himself alone honoured Now for this my assertion about that passion of his we have the greatest evidence by what he did to honour Caesar and Agrippa and his other friends  for with what honours he paid his respects to them who were his Chap VI ANTIQUITIES Of THE JEWS 897 superiors the same did he desire to be paid to himself and what he thought the most excellent present he could make ano ther he discovered an inclination to have the like presented to himself But now the Jewish nation is by their law a stranger to all such things and accustomed to prefer righteousness to glory for which reason that nation was not agreeable to him because it was out of their power to flatter the king s ambition with statues or temples or any other such performances And this seems to me to have been at once the occasion of Herod s crimes as to his own courtiers and counsellors and of his

mischief on other particular occasions When there fore they were thus afflicted and found no end of the barbar ous treatment they met with among the Greeks they sent am bassadors to Caesar on those accounts who gave them the same privileges as they had before and sent letters to the same pur pose to the governors of the provinces copies of which I sub join here as testimonials of the ancient

which I exercise toward all mankind and out of regard to Caius Marcus Censorinus together with the present decree be proposed in that most eminent place which hath been consecrated to me by the community of Asia at Ancyra And if any one transgress any part of what is above decreed he shall be severely punished This was inscribed upon a pillar in the temple of Caesar 3  Caesar to Norbanus Flaccus sendeth greeting Let those Jews how many soever they be who have been used according to their ancient custom to send their sacred money to Jerusalem do the same freely These were the decrees of Caesar 4 Agrippa also did himself write after the manner following on behalf of the Jews Agrippa to the magistrates senate and people of the Ephesians sendeth greeting I will that the care and custody of the sacred money that is carried to the temple at Jerusalem be left to the Jews of Asia to do with it according to their ancient custom and that such as steal that sacred money of the Jews and fly to a sanctuary shall be taken thence and delivered to the Jews by the same law that sacrilegious persons are taken thence I have also written to Sylvanus the pretor that no one compel the Jews

be exactly returned to the Jews in that place 6  Caius Norbanus Flaccus proconsul to the magistrates of the Sardians sendeth greeting Caesar hath written to me and commanded me not to forbid the Jews how many soever they be from assembling together according to the custom of their forefathers nor from sending their money to Jerusalem I have therefore written to you that you may know that both Caesar and I would have you act accordingly 7 Nor did Julius Antonius the proconsul write otherwise To the magistrates senate and people of the Ephesians send eth greeting As I was dispensing justice at Ephesus on the ides of February the Jews that dwell in Asia demonstrated to me that Augustus and Agrippa had permitted them to use their own laws and customs and to offer those their first fruits which every one of them freely offers to the Deity on account of piety and to carry them in a company together to Jerusalem without disturbance They also petitioned me that I also would confirm what had been granted by Augus tus and Agrippa by my own sanction I would therefore have you take notice that according to the will of Augustus and Agrippa I permit them to use and do according to the customs of their forefathers without disturbance 8 I have been obliged to set down these decrees because the present history of our own acts will go generally among the Greeks and I have hereby demonstrated to them that we have formerly been in great esteem and have not been prohibited by those governors we were under from keeping any of the laws of our forefathers nay that we have been supported by them while we followed our own religion and the worship we paid to God and I frequently make mention of these decrees in or der to reconcile other people to us and to take away the causes of that hatred which unreasonable men bear to us As for our  customs there is no nation which always makes use of the same and in every city almost we meet with them different from one another but natural justice is most agreeable to the advantage of all men equally both Greeks and Barbarians to which our laws have the greatest regard and thereby render us if we abide in them after a pure manner benevolent and friendly  The remaining part of this chapter is a remarkable one as justly distinguish ing natural justice religion and morality from positive institutions in all countries and evidently preferring the former before the latter as did the true prophets of Ood always under the Old Testament and Christ and his Apostles always under the New whence our Josephns seems to have been at this time nearer Christianity than wen th Scrifces and Pharisees ot his age who as wÂ know from the New Testament vÂ re entirely of a different opinion and practice 400 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XVI to all men on which account we have reason to expect the like return from others and to inform them that they ought not to esteem difference of positive institutions a sufficient cause of alienation but join with us in the pursuit of virtue and probity for this belongs to all men in common and of itself alone is sufficient for the preservation of human life I now return to the thread of my history CHAP VII How upon Herod s going down into David s sepulchre the sedi tion in his family greatly increased Â 1 As for Herod he had spent vast sums about the cities both without and within his own kingdom and as he had before heard that Hyrcanus who had been king before him had opened David s sepulchre and taken out of it three thousand talents of silver and that there was a much greater number left behind and indeed enough to suffice all his wants he had a great while an intention to make the attempt and at this time he opened that sepulchre by night and went into it and endea voured that it should not be at all known in the city but took only his most faithful friends with him As for any money he found none as Hyrcanus had done but that furniture of gold and those precious goods that were laid up there all which he took away However he had a great desire to make a more diligent search and to go farther in even as far as the very bodies of David and Solomon where two of his guards were slain by a flame that burst out upon those that went in as the report was So he was terribly affrighted and went out and built a propi tiatory monument of that fright he had been in and this of white stone at the mouth of the sepulchre and that at great ex pense also And even  Nicolaus his historiographer makes mention of this monument built by Herod though he does not mention his going dovn into the sepulchre as knowing that ac tion to be of ill repute and many other things he treats of in the same manner in his book for he wrote in Herod s lifetime and under his reign and so as to please him and as a servant to  It is here worth our observation how careful Josephus was to the discovery of truth in Herod s history since he would not follow Njcolaus of Damascus him self so great a historian where there was great reason to suspect that he flattered Herod which impartiality in history Josephus here solemnly professes and of which impartiality he has given more demonstrations than almost any historian whom soever But as to Herod s taking great wealth out of David s sepulchre though I cannot prove it yet do I strongly suspect it was this very history Chap VII ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 401 him touching upon nothing but what tended to his glory and openly excusing many of his notorious crimes and very diligently concealing them And as he was desirous to put handsome colours on the death of Mariamne and her sons which were barbarous actions in the king he tells falsehoods about the in continence of Mariamne and the treacherous designs of his sons upon him and thus he proceeded in his whole work making a pompous encomium upon what just actions he had done but ear nestly apologizing for his unjust ones Indeed a man as I said may have a great deal to say by way of excuse for Nicolaus for he did not so properly write this as a history for others as somewhat that might be subservient to the king himself As for ourselves who come of a family nearly allied to the Asamonean kings and on that account have an honourable place which is the priesthood we think it indecent to say any thing that is false about them and accordingly we have described their actions after an unblemished and upright manner And although we rever ence many of Herod s posterity who still reign yet do we pay A greater regard to truth than to them and this though it some times happens that we incur their displeasure by so doing 2 And indeed Herod s troubles in his family seemed to be augmented by reason of this attempt he made upon David s se pulchre whether divine vengeance increased the calamities he lay under in order to render them incurable or whether fortune made an assault upon him in those cases wherein the seasonable ness of the cause made it strongly believed that the calamities came upon him for his impiety for the tumult was like a civil war in his palace and their hatred towards one another was like that where each one strove to exceed another in calumnies However Antipater used stratagems perpetually against his brethren and that very cunningly While abroad he loaded them with accusations but still took upon him frequently to apologize for them that this apparent benevolence to them might make him be believed and forward his attempts against them by which means he after various manners circumvented his father who believed that all he did was for his preservation Herod also recommend ed Ptolemy who was a great director of the  affairs of his king dom to Antipater and consulted with his mother about the pub lic affairs also And indeed these were all in all and did what they pleased and made the king angry against any other persons as they thought it might be to their own advantage but still the sons of Mariamne were in a worse and worse condition perpetu ally and while they were thrust out and set in a more dishonour able rank who yet by birth were the most noble they could not bear the dishonour And for the women Glaphyra Alexan der s wife the daughter of Archelaus hated Salome both be 402 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XVI cause of her love to her husband and because Glaphyra seemed to behave herself somewhat insolently towards Salome s daugh ter who was the wife of Aristobulus which equality of hers to herself Glaphyra took very impatiently 3 Now besides this second contention that had fallen among them neither did the king s brother Pheroras keep himself out af trouble but had a particular foundation for suspicion and ha tred for he was overcome with the charms of his wife to such a degree of madness that he despised the king s daughter to whom he had been betrothed and wholly bent his mind to the other who had been but a servant Herod also was grieved by the dishonour that was done him because he had bestowed many favours upon him and had advanced him to that height of power that he was almost a partner with him in the kingdom and saw that he had not made him a due return for his favours and esteem ed himself unhappy on that account So upon Pheroras un woithy refusal he gave the damsel to Phasaelus son but after some time when he thought the heat of his brother s affections was over he blamed him for his former conduct and desired him to take his second daughter whose name was Cypros Pto lemy also advised him to leave off affronting his brother and to forsake her whom he had loved for that it was a base thing to be so enamoured of a servant as to deprive himself of the king s good will to him and become an occasion of his trouble and make himself hated by him Pheroras knew that this advice would be for his own advantage particularly because he had been ac cused before and forgiven so he put his wife away although he already had a son by her and engaged to the king that he would take his second daughter and agreed that the thirtieth day after should be the day of marriage and swore he would have no farther conversation with her whom he had put away but when the thirty days were over he was such a slave to his affections that he no longer performed any thing he had promised but con tinued still with his former wife This occasioned Herod to grieve openly and made him angry while the king dropped one word or other against Pheroras perpetually and many made the king s anger an opportunity for raising calumnies against him Nor had the king any longer a single quiet day or hour but oc easions of one fresh quarrel or another arose among his relations and those that were dearest to him for Salome was of a harsh temper and ill natured to Mariamne s sons nor would she suffer her own daughter who was the wife of Aristobulus one of those young men to bear a good will to her husband but per suaded her to tell her if he said any thing to her in private and when any misunderstandings happened as is common she raised a great many suspicions out of it by which means she Chap VII ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 408 learned all their concerns and made the damsel ill natured to the young man And in order to gratify her mother she often said that the young men used to mention Mariamne when they were by themselves and that they hated their father and were con tinually threatening that if they had once got the kingdom they would make Herod s sons by his other wives country school masters for that the present education which was given them and their diligence in learning fitted them for such an employ ment And as for the women whenever they saw them adorn ed with their mother s clothes they threatened that instead of their present gaudy apparel they should be clothed in sackcloth and confined so closely that they should not see the light of the sun These stories were presently carried by Salome to the king who was troubled to hear them and endeavoured to make up matters but these suspicions afflicted him and be coming more and more uneasy he believed every body against every body However upon his rebuking his sons and hearing the defence they made for themselves he was easier for a while though a little afterwards much worse accidents came upon him 4 For Pheroras came to Alexander the husband of Glaphy ra who was the daughter of Archelaus as we have already told you and said that he had heard from Salome that Herod was enamoured of Glaphyra and that his passion for her was in curable When Alexander heard that he was all on fire from his youth and jealousy and he interpreted the instances of He rod s obliging behaviour to her which were very frequent for the worse which came from those suspicions he had on account of that word which fell from Pheroras nor could he conceal his grief at the thing but informed him what words Pheroras had said Upon which Herod was in a greater disorder than ever and not bearing such a false calumny which was to his shame was much disturbed at it and often did he lament the wickedness of his domestics and how good he had been to them and how ill requitals they had made him So he sent for Pheroras and re proached him and said  Thou vilest of all men art thou come to that unmeasurable and extravagant degree of ingratitude as not only to suppose such things of me but to speak of them I now indeed perceive what thy intentions are it is not thy only aim to reproach me when thou usest such words to my son but thereby to persuade him to plot against me and get me destroyed by poison And who is there if he had not a good genius at his elbow as hath my son but would not bear such a suspicion of his father but would revenge himself upon him Dost thou suppose that thou hast only dropped a word for him to think of and not rather hast put a sword into his hand to slay his father And what dost thou Â n 8 E 27 104 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XVL mean when thou really hatest both him and his brother to pretend kindness to them only in order to raise a reproach against me and talk of such things as no one but such an im pious wretch as thou art could either devise in their mind or declare in their words Begone thou that art such a plague to thy benefactor and thy brother and may that evil con science of thine go along with thee while I still overcome my relations by kindness and am so far from avenging myself of them as they deserve that I bestow greater benefits upon them than they are worthy of 5 Thus did the king speak Whereupon Pheroras who was caught in the very act of his villany said That  it was Salome who was the framer of this plot and that the words came from her But as soon as she heard that for she was at hand she cried out like one that would be believed that no such thing ever came out of her mouth  that they all earnestly endeavoured to make the king hate her and to make her away because of the good will she bore to Herod and because she was always fore seeing the dangers that were coming upon him and that at pre sent there were more plots against him than usual for while she was the only person who persuaded her brother to put away the wife he now had and to take the king s daughter it was no wonder if she were hated by him As she said this and of ten tore her hair and often heather breast her countenance made her denial to be believed but the perverseness of her manners de clared at the same time her dissimulation in these proceedings but Pheroras was caught between them and had nothing plausible to offer in his own defence while he confessed that he had said what was charged upon him but was not believed when he said he had heard it from Salome so the confusion among them was increas ed and their quarrelsome words one to another At last the king out of his hatred to his brother and sister sent them both away and when he had commended the moderation of his son and that he had himself told him of the report he went in the evening to refresh himself After such a contest as this had fallen out among them Salome s reputation suffered greatly since she was supposed to have first raised the calumny  and the king s wives were grieved at her as knowing she was a very ill natured woman and would sometimes be a friend and sometimes an enemy at different seasons so they perpetually said one thing or another against her and somewhat that now fell out made them the bolder in speaking against her 6 There was one Obodas king of Arabia an inactive and slothful man in his nature but Sylleus managed most of his af fairs to him He was a shrewd man although he was but young and was handsome withal This Sylleus upon some Chap VII ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 405 occasion coming to Herod and supping with him saw Salome and set his heart upon her and understanding that she was a widow he discoursed with her Now because Salome was at this time less in favour with her brother she looked upon Syl leus with some passion and was very earnest to be married to him and on the days following there appeared many and those very great indications of their agreement together Now the women carried this news to the king and laughed at the inde cency of it whereupon Herod inquired about it farther of Phe roras and desired him to observe them at supper how their be haviour was one toward another who told him that by the signals which came from their heads and their eyes they both were evidently in love After this Sylleus the Arabian being suspected went away but came again two or three months after wards as it were on that very design and spoke to Herod about it and desired that Salome might be given him to wife for that his affinity might not be disadvantageous to his affairs by a union with Arabia the government of which country was already in effect under his power and more evidently would be his hereafter Accordingly when Herod discoursed with his sister about it and asked her whether she were disposed to this match she immediately agreed to it But when Sylleus was desired to come over to the Jewish religion and then he should marry her and that it was impossible to do it on any other terms he could not bear that proposal and went his way for he said that if he should do so he should be stoned by the Arabs Then did Pheroras reproach Salome for her incontinency as did the women much more and said that Sylleus had debauched her As for that damsel whom the king had betrothed to his bro ther Pheroras but he had not taken her as I have before re lated because he was enamoured of his former wife Salome desired of Herod she might be given to her son by Costobarus which match he was very willing to but was dissuaded from it by Pheroras who pleaded that this young man would not be kind to her since his father had been slain by him and that it was more just that his son who was to be his successor in the tetrarchy should have her So he begged his pardon and per suaded him to do so Accordingly the damsel upon this change of her espousals was disposed of to this young man the son of Pheroras the king giving for her portion a hundred talents 406 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XVI CHAP VIII Herod took vp Alexander and bound him tehom yet Ar chelaus king of Cappadocia reconciled to his father Herod again Â 1 I UT still the affairs of Herod s family were no better but perpetually more troublesome Now this accident happened which arose from no decent occasion but proceeded so far as to bring great difficulties upon him There were certain eu nuchs which the king had and on account of their beauty was very fond of them and the care of bringing him drink was en trusted to one of them of bringing him his supper to another and of putting him to bed to the third who almost managed the principal affairs of the government and there was one told the king that these eunuchs were corrupted by Alexander the king s son with great sums of money And when they were asked whether Alexander had had criminal conversation with them they confessed it but said they knew of no farther mischief of his against his father but when they were more severely tor tured and were in the utmost extremity and the tormentors out of compliance with Antipater stretched the rack to the very utmost they said that Alexander bare great ill will and in nate hatred to his father  and that he told them that Herod de spaired to live much longer and that in order to cover his great age he coloured his hair black and endeavoured to conceal what would discover how old he was but that if he would apply himself to him when he should attain the kingdom which in spite of his father could come to no one else he should quickly have the first place in that kingdom under him for that he was now ready to take the kingdom not only as his birthright but by the preparations he had made for obtaining it because a great many of the rulers and a great many of his friends were of his side and those no ill men neither ready both to do and to suffer whatsoever should come on that account 2 When Herod heard this confession he was all over anger and fear some parts seeming to him reproachful and some made him suspicious of dangers that attended him insomuch that on both accounts he was provoked and bitterly afraid lest some more heavy plot was laid against him than he should be then able to escape from whereupon he did not now make an open search but sent about spies to watch such as he suspected for he was now overrun with suspicion and hatred against all about him and indulging abundance of those suspicions in order to his preservation he continued to suspect those that were guiltless Chap VIII ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 4O7 nor did he set any bounds to himself but supposing that those who staid with him had the most power to hurt him they were to him very frightful and for those that did not use to come to him it seemed enough to name them to make them suspected and he thought himself safer when they were destroyed And at last his domestics were come to that pass that being no way se cure of escaping themselves they fell to accusing one another and imagining that he who first accused another was most likely to save himself yet when any had overthrown others they were hated and they were thought to suffer justly who unjustly accused others and they only thereby prevented their own accusation nay they now executed their own private enmities by this means and when they were caught they were punished in the same way Thus these men contrived to make use of this opportunity as an instrument and a snare against their ene mies yet when they tried it were themselves caught also in the same snare which they kid for others And the king soon re pented of what he had done because he had no clear evidence of the guilt of those whom he had slain and yet what was still more severe in him he did not make use of his repentance in order to leave off doing the like again but in order to inflict the same punishment upon their accusers 8 And in this state of disorder were the affairs of the palace and he had already told many of his friends directly that they ought not to appear before him nor come into the palace and the reason of this injunction was that when they were there he had less freedom of acting or a greater restraint on himself on their account for at this time it was that he expelled An dromachus and Gamellus men who had of old been his friends and been very useful to him in the affairs of his kingdom and been of advantage to his family by their embassages and coun sels and had been tutors to his sons and had in a manner the first degree of freedom with him He expelled Andromachus because his son Demetrius was a companion to Alexander and Gamellus because he knew that he wished him well which arose from his having been with him in his youth when he was at school and absent at Rome These he expelled out of his palace and was willing enough to have done worse by them but that he might not seem to take such liberty against men oi so great reputation he contented himself with depriving them of their dignity and of their power to hinder his wicked pro ceedings t Now it was Antipater who was the cause of all this who when he knew what a mad and licentious way of acting his fa ther was in and had been a great while one of his counsellors be hurried him on and then thought he should bring him to do 408 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XVI somewhat to purpose when every one that could oppose him was taken away When therefore Andromachus and his friends were driven away and had no discourse nor freedom with the king any longer the king in the first place examined by torture all whom he thought to be faithful to Alexander whether they knew of any of his attempts against him but these died with out having any thing to say to that matter which made the king more zealous after discoveries when he could not find out what evil proceedings he suspected them of As for Antipater he was very sagacious to raise a calumny against those that were really innocent as if their denial was only their constancy and fidelity to Alexander and thereupon provoked Herod to disco ver by the torture of great numbers what attempts were still con cealed Now there was a certain person among the many that were tortured who said that he knew that the young man had of ten said that when he was commended as a tall man in his body and a skilful marksman and that in his commendable exercises he exceeded all men these qualifications given him by nature though good in themselves were not advantageous to him be cause his father was grieved at them and envied him for them and that when he walked along with his father he endeavoured to de press and shorten himself that he might not appear too tall and that when he shot at any thing as he was hunting when his father was by he missed his mark on purpose for he knew how ambitious his father was of being superior in such exercises So when the man was tormented about this saying and had ease given his body after it he added that he had his brother Aristobulus for his assistance and contrived to lie in wait for their father as they were hunting and kill him and when they had done so to fly to Rome and desire to have the kingdom given them There were also letters of the young man found written to his brother wherein he complained that his father did not act justly in giv ing Antipater a country whose yearly revenues amounted to two hundred talents Upon these confessions Herod presently thought he had somewhat to depend on in his own opinion as to his suspicion about his sons So he took up Alexander and bound him yet did he still continue to be uneasy and was not quite satisfied of the truth of what he had heard and when he came to recollect himself he found that they had only made ju venile complaints and contentions and that it was an incredible thing that when his son should have slain him he should openly go to Rome to beg the kingdom so he was desirous to have some surer mark of his son s wickedness and was very solicitous about it that he might not appear to have condemned him to be put in prison too rashly so he tortured the principal of Alex ander s friends and out not a few of them to death without get Chap VIII ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 409 ting any of the things out of them which he suspected And while Herod was very busy about this matter and the palace was full of terror and trouble one of the younger sort when he was in the utmost agony confessed that Alexander had sent to his friends at Rome and desired that he might be quickly in vited thither by Caesar and that he could discover a plot against him that Mithridates the king of Parthia was joined in a friendship with his father against the Romans and that he had a poisonous potion ready prepared at Askelon 5 To these accusations Herod gave credit and enjoyed hereby in his miserable case some sort of consolation in excuse of his rashness as flattering himself with rmding things in so bad a con dition but as for the poisonous potion which he laboured to find he could find none As for Alexander he was very desirous to aggravate the vast misfortunes he was under so he pretended not to deny the accusations but punished the rashness of his fa ther with a great crime of his own and perhaps he was willing to make his father ashamed of his easy belief of such calumnies he aimed especially if he could gain belief to his story to plague him and his whole kingdom for he wrote four letters and sent them to him that  he did not need to torture any more persons for he had plotted against him and that he had for his part ners Pheroras and the most faithful of his friends and that Salome came in to him by night and that she lay with him whether he would or no and that all men were come to be of one mind to make away with him as soon as they could and so get clear of the continual fear they were in from him Among these were accused Ptolemy and Sapinnius who were the most faithful friends to the king And what more can be said but that those who before were the most intimate friends were become wild beasts to one another as if a certain madness had fallen upon them while there was no room for defence or refutation in order to the discovery of the truth but all were at random doomed to destruction  so that some lamented those that were in prison some those that were put to death and others lamented that they were in the expectation of the same miseries and a melancholy solitude rendered the kingdom de formed and quite the reverse to that happy state it was formerly in Herod s own life also was entirely disturbed and because he could trust nobody he was sorely punished by the expecta tion of farther misery for he often fancied in his imagination that his son had fallen upon him or stood by him with a sword in his hand and thus was his mind night and day intent upon this thing and revolved it over and over no otherwise than if he were under a distraction And this was the sad condition Herod was now in  410 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XVI 6 But when Archelaus king of Cappadocia heard of the state that Herod was in and being in great distress about his daughter and the young man her husband and grieving with Herod as with a man that was his friend on account of so great a disturbance as he was under he came to Jerusalem on pur pose to compose their differences and when he found Herod in such a temper he thought it wholly unseasonable to reprove him or to pretend that he had done any thing rashly for that he should thereby naturally bring him to dispute the point with him and by still more and more apologizing for himself to be the more irritated He went therefore another way to work in or der to correct the former misfortunes and appeared angry at the young man and said that Herod had been so very mild a man that he had not acted a rash part at all Healsosaid hewoulddis solve his daughter s marriage with Alexander nor could in jus tice spare his own daughter if she were conscious of any thing and did not inform Herod of it When Archelaus appeared to be of this temper and otherwise than Herod expected or imag ined and for the main took Herod s part and was angry on his account the king abated of his harshness and took occasion from his appearing to have acted justly hitherto to come by degrees to put on the affection of a father and was on both sides to be pitied for when some persons refuted the calumnies that were laid on the young man he was thrown into a passion but when Archelaus joined in the accusation he was dissolved into tearsand sorrow after an affectionatemanner Accordingly hedesiredthat he would not dissolve his son s marriage and became not so an gry as before for his offences So when Archelaus had brought him to a more moderate temper he transferred the calumnies upon his friends and said it must be owing to them that so young a man and one unacquainted with malice was corrupted and he supposed that there was more reason to suspect the bro ther than the son Upon which Herod was very much displeased at Pheroras who indeed now had no one that could make a reconciliation between him and his brother so when he saw that Archelaus had the greatest power with Herod he betook himself to him in the habit of a mourner and like one that had all the signs upon him of an undone man Upon this Archelaus did not overlook the intercession he made to him nor yet did he undertake to change the king s disposition towards him imme diately and he said that it was better for him to come himself to the king and confess himself the occasion of all that this would make the king s anger not to be extravagant towards him and that then he would be present to assist him When he had persuaded him to this he gained his point with both of them and the calumnies raised Â gainst the young man were beyond Chap IX ANTIgUITIES OF THE JEWS 411 all expectation wiped off And Archelaus as soon as he had made the reconciliation went then away to Cappadocia having proved at this juncture of time the most acceptable person to Herod in the world on which account he gave him the richest presents as tokens of his respect to him and being on other oc casions magnanimous he esteemed him one of his dearest friends He also made an agreement with him that he would go to Rome because he had written to Caesar about these affairs so they went together as far as Antioch and there Herod made a recon ciliation between Archelaus and Titus the president of Syria who had been greatly at variance and so returned back to Judea CHAP IX Concerning the revolt

arose between him and the Arabians on the oc casion following The inhabitants of Trachonitis after Caesar had taken the country away from Zednodorus and added it to Herod had not now power to rob but were forced to plough the land and to live quietly which was a thing they did not like and when they did take that pains the ground did not produce much fruit for them However at the first the king would not permit them to rob and so they abstained from that unjust way of living upon their neighbours which procured Herod a great reputation for his care But when he was sailing to Rome it was at that time when he went to accuse his son Alexander and to commit Antipater to Caesar s protection the Trachonites spread a report as if he were dead and revolted from his dominion and betook themselves again to their accus tomed way of robbing their neighbours at which time the king s commanders subdued them during his absence but about forty of the principal robbers being terrified by those that had been taken left the country and retired into Arabia Sylleus entertaining them after he had missed of marrying Salome and gave them a place of strength in which they dwelt So they over ran not only Judea butall Coelesyria also and carried off the prey while Sylleus afforded them places of protection and quietness during their wicked practices But when Herod came back from Rome he perceived that his dominions had greatly suffered by them and since he could not reach the robbers themselves be cause of the secure retreat they had in that country and which VOL n 3 F 27 41 2 ANTIQUITIES Â Â F Hit S l tfS Book XVI the Arabian government afforded them and jet being very un easy at the injuries they had done him he went all over Tra chonitis and slew their relations whereupon these robbers were more angry than before it being a law among them to be aven ged on the murderers of their relations by all possible means so they continued to tear and rend every thing under Herod s do miniou with impunity Then did he discourse about these rob beries to Saturninus and VoLumuius and required that they ifaould be punished upon which occasion they still tbe more confirmed themselves in their robberies and became mjre nu merous and made very great disturbances laying waste the countries and villages that belonged to Herod s kingdom and killing those men whom they caught till these unjust pro ceedings came to be like a real war for the robbers were now become about a thousand At which Herod was sore displeas ed and required the robbers as weli as the money which he had lent Dbodas by Sylleus which was sixty talents and since the time of payment was now past he desired to have it paid him but Sylleus who had laid Obodas aside and managed all by him self denied that the robbers were in Arabia and put off the pay ment of the money about which there was a hearing before  Saturninus and Volumnius who were then the presidents of Syria At last he by their means agreed that within thirty days time Herod should be paid his money and that each ot them should deliver up the other s subjects reciprocally Now as to Herod there was not one of the other s subjects found in his kingdom either as doing any injustice or on any other account but it was proved that the Arabians had the robbers amongst them 2 When this day appointed for payment of the money was past without Sylleus performing any part of his agreement and he was gone to Rome Herod demanded the payment of the money and that the robbers that were in Arabia should be de livered up and by the permission of Saturninus and Volum nius executed the judgment himself upon those that were re fractory He took an army that he had and led it into Arabia and in three days time by forced marches arrived at the garrison wherein the robbers were he made an assault upon them and took them all and demolished the place which was called Raepta but did no harm to any others but as the Ara bians came to their assistance under Nacebus their captain there ensued a battle wherein a few of Herod s soldiers and Nacebus  These joint presidents of Syria Saturninus and Volumnius were not perhaps of equal authority but the latter like a procurator under the former as the very learned Noris and Pagi and wiih them Dr Hudson determine Chap IX ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 413 the captain of the Arabians and about twenty of his soldiers fell while the rest betook themselves to flight So when he had brought these to punishment he placed three thousand Idu means in Trachonitis and thereby restrained the robbers that were there He also sent an account to the captains that were about Phenicia and demonstrated that he had done nothing but what he ought to do in punishing the refractory Arabians which upon an exact inquiry they found to be no more than what was true 3 However messengers were hasted away to Sylleus to Rome and informed him of what had been done and as is usual aggra vated every thing Now Sylleus had already insinuated himself into the knowledge of Caesar and was then about the palace and as soon as he heard of these things he changed his habit into black and went in and told Caesar That  Arabia was af flicted with war and that all his kingdom was in great con fusion upon Herod s laying it waste with his army and he said with tears in his eyes that two thousand five hundred of the principal men among the Arabians had been destroyed and that their captain Nacebus his familiar friend and kins man was slain and that the riches that were at Raepta were carried off and hat Obodas was despised whose infirm state of body rendered him unfit for war on which account neither he nor the Arabian army were present When Sylleus said so and added invidiously That  he would not himself have come out of the country unless he had believed that Caesar would have provided that they should all have peace one with another and that had he been there he would have taken care that the war should not have been to Herod s advantage Caesar was provoked when this was said and asked no more than this one question both of Herod s friends that were there and of his own friends who were come from Syria  Whe ther Herod had led an army thither And when they were forced to confess so much Cajsar without stay ing to hear for what reason he did it and how it was done grew very angry and wrote to Herod sharply The sum of his epistle was this That whereas of old he had used him as his friend he should now use him as his subject Sylleus also wrote an account of this to the Arabians who were so elevated with it that they neither delivered up the robbers that had fled to them nor paid the money that was due they retained those pastures also which they had hired and kept them without paying their rent and all this because the king of the Jews was now in a low con dition by reason of Caasar s anger at him Those of Tracho nitis also made use of this opportunity and rose up against the Idumean garrison and followed the same way of robbing with 414 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XVI the Arabians who had pillaged their country and were more rigid in their unjust proceedings not only in order to get by it but by way of revenge also 4 Now Herod was forced to bear all this that confidence of his being quite gone with which Caesar s favour used to inspire him for Caesar would not admit so much as an embassage from him to make an apology for him and when they came again he sent them away without success so he was cast into sadness and fear and Sylleus circumstances grieved him exceedingly who was now believed by Caesar and was present at Rome nay sometimes aspiring higher Now it came to pass that Obodas was dead and Eneas whose name was afterwards changed to  Aretas took the government for Sylleus endeavoured by ca lumnies to get him turned out of his principality that he might himself take it with which design he gave much money to the courtiers and promised much money to Caesar who indeed was angry that Aretas had not sent to him first before he took the kingdom yet did Eneas send an epistle and presents to Caesar and a golden crown of the weight of many talents Now that epistle accused Sylleus as having been a wicked servant and hav ing killed Obodas by poison and that while he was alive he had governed him as he pleased and had also debauched the wives of the Arabians and had borrowed money in order to obtain the dominion for himself yet did not Caesar give heed to these accusations but sent his ambassadors back without re ceiving any of his presents but in the meantime the affairs of Judea and Arabia became worse and worse partly because of the anarchy they were under and partly because as bad as they were nobody had power to govern them for of the two kings the one was not yet confirmed in his kingdom and so had not authority sufficient to restrain the evil doers and as for Herod Caesar was immediately angry at him for having avenged him self and so he was compelled to bear all the injuries that were offered him At length when he saw no end of the mischief which surrounded him he resolved to send ambassadors to Rome again to see whether his friends had prevailed to mitigate Cae sar and to address themselves to Caesar himself and the am bassador he sent thither was Nicolaus of Damascus  This Aretas was now become so established a name for the kings of Arabia  at Petra and Damascus that when the crown came to this Eneas he changed his name to Gretas as Harercamp here justly observes See Antiq B XIII ch xv Met 2 vol II Chap X ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 415 CHAP X How Eurycles falsely accused Herod s sons  and hc w their father bound them and wrote to Caesar about them Of Sylleus and how he was accused by Nicolaus J 1 IKE disorders about Herod s family and children about this time grew much worse for it now appeared certain nor was it unforeseen beforehand that fortune threatened the Greatest and most insupportable misfortunes possible to his ingdom Its progress and augmentation at this time arose on the occasion following One Eurycles a Lacedemonian a per son of note there but a man of a perverse mind and so cunning in his ways of voluptuousness and flattery as to indulge both and yet seem to indulge neither of them came in his travels to Herod and made him presents but so that he received more presents from him He also took such proper seasons for in sinuating himself into his friendship that he became one of the most intimate of the king s friends He had his lodging in Antipater s house but he had not only access but free conver sation with Alexander as pretending to him that he was in great favour with Archelaus the king of Cappadocia whence he pretended much respect to Glaphyra and in an occult manner cultivated a friendship with them all but always attending to what was said and done that he might be furnished with ca lumnies to please them all In short he behaved himself so to every body in his conversation as to appear to be his particular friend and he made others believe that his being any where was for that person s advantage So he won upon Alexander who was but young and persuaded him that he might open his grievances to him with assurance and with nobody else So he declared his grief to him how his father was alienated from him He related to him also the affairs of his mother and of Antipater that he had driven them from their proper dignity and had the power over every thing himself that no part of this was tolerable since his father was already come to hate them and he added that he would neither admit them to his table nor to his conversation Such were the complaints as was but natural of Alexander about the things that troubled him and these discourses Eurycles carried to Antipater and told him he did not inform him of this on his own account but that being overcome by his kindness the great importance of the thing obliged him to do it and he warned him to have a care of Alexander for that what he said was spoken with ve hemency and that in consequence of what he said he would certainly kill him with his own hand Whereupon Antipater 416 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XVI thinking him to be his friend by this advice gave him presents upon all occasions and at length persuaded him to inform Herod of what he had heard So when he related to the king Alexander s ill temper as discovered by the words he had hearrl him speak he was easily believed by him and he thereby brought the king to that pass turning him about by his words and ir ritating him till he increased his hatred to him and made him implacable which he showed at that very time for he imme diately gave Eurycles a present of fifty talents who when he had gotten them went to Archelaus king of Cappadocia and commended Alexander before him and told him that he had been many ways of advantage to him in making a reconciliation between him and his father So he got money from him also and went away before his pernicious practices were found out but when Eurycles was returned to Lacedemon he did not leave off doing mischief and so for his many acts of injustice he was banished from his own country 2 But as for the king of the Jews he was not now in the tempeV he was in formerly towards Alexander and Aristobulus when he had been content with the hearing their calumnies when others told him of them but he was now come to that pass as to hate them himself and to urge men to speak against them though they did not do it of themselves He also observed all that was said and put questions and gave ear to every one that would but speak if they could but say any thing against them till at length he heard that Euaratus of Cos was a con spirator with Alexander which thing to Herod was the most agreeable and sweetest news imaginable 3 But still a greater misfortune came upon the young men while the calumnies against them were continually increased and as a man may say one would think it was every one s endeavour to lay some grievous thing to their charge which might appear to be for the king s preservation There were two guards of Herod s body who were in great esteem for their strength and tallness Jucundus and Tyrannus these men had been cast off by Herod who was displeased at them these now used to ride along with Alexander and for their skill in their exercises were in great esteem with him and had some gold and other gifts bestowed upon them Now the king having an immediate suspicion of those men had them tortured who endured the torture courageously for a long time but at last confessed that Alexander would have persuaded them to kill Herod when he was in pursuit of the wild beasts That it might be said he fell from his horse and was run through with his own spear for that he had once such a misfortune formerly They also showed where there was money hidden in the stable Chap X ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 417 under ground and these convicted the king s chief hunter that he had given the young men the royal hunting spears and weapons to Alexander s dependents at Alexander s command 4 After these the commander of the garrison of Alexandrium was caught and tortured for he was accused to have promised to receive the young men into his fortress and to supply them with that money of the king s which was laid up in that fortress yet did he not acknowledge any thing of it himself but his son came in and said it was so and delivered up the writing which so far as could be guessed was in Alexander s hand Its con tents were these  When we have finished by God s help all that we have proposed to do we will come to you but do your endeavours as you have promised to receive us into your fortress After this writing was produced Herod had no doubt about the treacherous designs of his sons against him But Alexander said that Diophantus the scribe had imitated his hand and that the paper was maliciously drawn up by Antipater for Diophantus appeared to be very cunning in such practices and as he was afterward convicted of forging other papers he was put to death for it S So the king produced those that had been tortured before the multitude at Jericho in order to have them accuse the young men which accusers many of the people stoned to death and when they were going to kill Alexander and Aristobulus like wise the king would not permit them to do so but restrained the multitude by the means of Ptolemy and Pheroras However the young men were put under a guard and kept in custody that nobody might come at them and all that they did or said was watched and the reproach and fear they were in was little or nothing different from those of condemned criminals and one of them who was Aristobulus was so deeply affected that he brought Salome who was his aunt and his mother in law to lament with him for his calamities and to hate him who had suf fered things to come to that pass when he said to her Art  not thou in danger of destruction also while the report goes that thou hadst disclosed beforehand all our affairs to Sylleus when thou wast in hopes of being married to him But she immediately carried those words to her brother upon this he was out of patience and gave command to bind him and enjoined them both now they were kept separate one from the other to write down the ill things they had done against their father and bring the writings to him So when this was enjoined them they wrote this that they had laid no treacherous designs noi made any preparations against their father but that they had intended to fly away and that by the distress they were in their lives being now uncertain and tedious to them 418 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XVI 6 About this time there came an ambassador out of Cappa docia from Archelaus whose name was Melas he was one of the prmcipal rulers under him So Herod being desirous to show Archelaus ill will to him called for Alexander as he was in his bonds and asked him again concerning his flight whither and how they had resolved to retire Alexander re plied To Archelaus who had promised to send them away to Rome but that they had no wicked nor mischievous de signs against their father and that nothing of that nature  which their adversaries had charged upon them was true and that their desire was that he might have examined Ty rannus and Jucundus more strictly but that they had been suddenly slain by the means of Antipater who put his own friends among the multitude for that purpose 7 When this was said Herod commanded that both Alexan der and Melas should be carried to Glaphyra Archelaus daugh ter and that she should be asked whether she did not know somewhat of Alexander s treacherous designs against Herod Now as soon as they were come to her and she saw Alexander in bonds she beat her head and in a great consternation gave a deep and moving groan The young man also fell into tears This was so miserable a spectacle to those present that for a great while they were not able to say or do any thing but at length Ptolemy who was ordered to bring Alexander bid him say whether his wife were conscious of his actions He re plied  How is it possible that she whom I love better than my own soul and by whom I have had children should not know what I do Upon which she cried out That she knew of no wicked designs of his but that yet if her accusing herself falsely would tend to his preservation she would confess it all Alexander replied There is no such wickedness as those who ought the least of all so to do suspect which either I have imagined or thou knowest of but this only that we had resolved to retire to Archelaus and from thence to Rome Which she also confessed Upon which Herod supposing that Archelaus ill will to him was fully proved he sent a letter by Olympus and Volumnius and bid them as they sailed by to touch at Eleusa of Cilicia and give Archelaus the letter And that when they had expostulated with him that had a hand in his son s treacherous design against him they should from thence sail to Rome and that in case they found Nicolaus had gained any ground and that Czesar was no longer displeased at him he should give him his letters and the proofs which he had ready to show against the young men As to Archelaus he made this defence for himself That  he had promised to re ceive the young men because it was both for their own and Chap X ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 419 their father s advantage so to do lest some too severe proce dure should be gone upon in that anger and disorder thev were in on occasion of the present suspicions but that still he had not promised to send them to Caesar and that he had not promised any thing else to the young men that could show ill will to him 8 When these ambassadors were come to Rome they had a fit opportunity of delivering their letters to Caesar because they found him reconciled to Herod for the circumstance of Nico laus embassage had been as follows As soon as he was come to Rome and was about the court he did not first of all set about what he was come for only but he thought fit also to accuse Sylleus Now the Arabians even before he came to talk with them were quarrelling one with another and some of them left Sylleus party and joining themselves to Nicolaus inform ed him of all the wicked things that had been done and pro duced to him evident demonstrations of the slaughter of a great number of Obodas friends by Sylleus for when these men left Sylleus they had carried off with them those letters whereby they could convict him When Nicolaus saw such an oppor tunity afforded him he made use of it in order to gain his own point afterward and endeavoured immediately to make a recon ciliation between Caesar and Herod for he was fully satisfied that if he should desire to make a defence for Herod directly he should not be allowed that liberty but that if he desired to accuse Sylleus there would an occasion present itself of speaking on Herod s behalf So when the cause was ready for a hearing and the day was appointed Nicolaus while Aretas ambassadors were present accused Sylleus and said That he imputed to him the destruction of the king Obodas and of many others of the Arabians that he had borrowed money for no good design and he proved that he had been guilty of adultery not only with the Arabians but Roman women also And he added That above all the rest he had alienated Caesar from Herod and that all that he had said about the actions of He rod were falsities When Nicolaus was come to this topic Cae sar stopped him from going on and desired him only to spe ik to this aflair of Herod s and to show that  he had not led an army into Arabia nor slain two thousand five hundred men there nor taken prisoners nor pillaged the country To which Nicolaus made this answer  I shall principally demonstrate that either nothing at all or but a very little of those imputa tions are true of which thou hast been informed for had they been true thou mightest justly have been still more angry at Herod At this strange assertion Caesar was very at tentive and Nicolaus said That there was a debt due to He VOL II 3 G 27 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XVI rod of five hundred talents and a bond wherein it was writ ten that if the time appointed be elapsed it should be lawf jl to make a seizure out of any part of his country As for the pretended army he said it was no army but a party sent out to require the just payment of the money that this was not sent immediately nor so soon as the bond allowed but that Sylleus had frequently come before Saturninus and Vo lumnius the presidents of Syria and that at last he had sworn at Berytus  by thy fortune that he would certainly pay the money within thirty days and deliver up the fugitives that were under his dominion And that when Sylleus had per formed nothing of this Herod came again before the presi dents and upon their permission to make a seizure for his money he with difficulty went out of his country with a party of soldiers for that purpose And this is all the war which these men so tragically describe and this is the affair of the expedition into Arabia And how can this be called a war when thy presidents permitted it the covenants allowed it and it was not executed till thy name O Caesar as well as that of the other gods had been profaned And now I must speak in order about the captives There were robbers that dwelt in Trachonites at first their number was no more than forty but they became more afterwards and they escaped the punishment Herod would have inflicted on them by making Arabia their refuge Sylleus received them and supported them with food that they might be mischievous to all man kind and gave them a country to inhabit and himself receiv ed the gains they made by robbery yet did he promise that he would deliver up these men and that by the same oaths and same time that he swore and fixed for payment of his debt nor can he by any means show that any other per sons have at this time been taken out of Arabia besides these and indeed not all these neither but only so many as could not conceal themselves And thus does the calumny of  the captives which hath been so odiously represented ap pear to be no better than a fiction and a lie made on pur pose to provoke thy indignation for I venture to affirm that when the forces of the Arabians came upon us and one or two of Herod s party fell he then only defended himself and there fell Nacebus their general and in all about twenty five others and no more when Sylleus by multiplying every single soldier to a hundred he reckons the slain to have been two thousand five hundred  This oath by the fortune of Crfsar was put to Polycarp a bishop of Smyrna hy the Roman governor to try vhethtr ho was a Christian as they were then esteemed who refused to swear that oath Martyr 1 olyoup sect 9 Chap XL ANTIOUITII S OF THE JKWH 4 2l 9 This provoked Caesar more than ever so he turned to Sylleus full of rage and asked him how many of the Arabians were slain Hereupon he hesitated and said he had been im posed upon The covenants also were read about the money he had borrowed and the letters of the presidents of Syria and the complaints of the several cities so many as had been injured by the robbers The conclusion was this that Sylleus was con demned to die and that Caesar was reconciled to Herod and owned his repentance for what severe things he had written to him occasioned by calumny insomuch that he told Sylleus that he had compelled him by his lying account of things to be guilty of ingratitude against a man that was his friend At the last all came to this Sylleus was sent away to answer Herod s suit and to repay the debt that he owed and after that to be punished with death But still Caesar was offended with Are tas that he had taken upon himself the government without his consent first obtained for he had determined to bestow Arabia upon Herod but that the letters he had sent hindered him from so doing for Olympus and Volumnius perceiving that Caesar was now become favourable to Herod thought fit immediately to deliver him the letters they were commanded by Herod to give him concerning his sons When Csssar had read them he thought it would not be proper to add another government to him now he was old and in an ill state with re lation to his sons so he admitted Aretas ambassadors and after he had just reproved him for his rashness in not tarrying till he received the kingdom from him he accepted of his pre sents and confirmed him in his government CHAP XI How Herod by permission from Ctesar accused his sons before an assembly of judges at Berytus and what Tero suffered Jar using a boundless and military liberty of speech Con cerning also the death of the young men and their burial at Alexandrium 5 1 So Caesar was now reconciled to Herod and wrote thus to him That he was grieved for him on account of his sons and that in case they had been guilty of any profane and insolent crimes against him it would behove him to pu nish them as parricides for which he gave him power accord ingly but if they had only contrived to fly away he would have him give them an admonition and not proceed to extre mity with them He also advised him to get an assembly 422 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XVI c together and to appoint some place near  Berytus which is a city belonging to the Romans and to take the presi dents of Syria and Archelaus king of Cappadocia and as many more as he thought to be illustrious tor their friend ship to him and the dignities they were in and determine what should be done by their approbation These were the directions that Caesar gave him Accordingly Herod when the letter was brought to him was immediately very flad of Caesar s reconciliation to him and very glad also that e had a complete authority given him over his sons And it strangely came about that whereas before in his adversity though he had indeed showed himself severe yet had he not been very rash nor hasty in procuring the destruction of his sons he now in his prosperity took advantage of this change for the better and the freedom he now had to exercise his hatred against them after an unheard of manner he therefore sent and called as many as he thought fit to this assembly ex cepting Archelaus for as for him he either hated him so that he would not invite him or he thought he would be an obsta cle to his designs 2 When the presidents and the rest that belonged to the ci nes were come to Berytus he kept his sons in a certain vil lage belonging to Sidon called Platana but near to this city that if they were called he might produce them for he did not think fit to bring them before the assembly and when there were one hundred and fifty assessors present Herod came by himself alone and accused his sons and that in such a way as if it were not a melancholy accusation and not made but out of necessity and upon the misfortunes he was under indeed in such a way as was very indecent for a father to accuse his sons for he was very vehement and disordered when he came to the demonstra tion of the crime they were accused of and gave the greatest signs of passion and barbarity nor would he suffer the assessors to consider of the weight of the evidence but asserted them to be true by his own authority after a manner most indecent in a father against his sons and read himself what they themselves had written wherein there was no confession of any plots or con trivances against him But only how they had contrived to fly away and containing withal certain reproaches against him on account of the ill will he bore them and when he came to those  What Josephus relates Augustus to have here said that Berytus was a city belonging to the Romans is confirmed by Spanheim s notes here  It was says he a colony placed there by Augustus Whence Ulpian De tens teL L T X r The colony of Berytus was rendered famous Â the benefits of Caesar And thence it is that among the coins of Augustus we meet with some having this  inscription The hafjty colony if Augustus at Berytus Chap XI ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 423 reproaches he cried out most of all and exaggerated what they said as if they had confessed thc design against him and took his oath that he had rather lose his life than hear such reproach ful words At last he said That he had sufficient authority both by nature and by Cajsar s grant to him to do what he thought fit He also added an allegation of a law of their country which enjoined this That if parents laid their hands on the head of him that was accused the standers by were obli ged to cast stones at him and thereby toslay him which though he was ready to do in his own country and kingdom yet did he wait for their determination that yet they came thither not so much as judges to condemn them for such manifest designs against him whereby he had almost perished by his sons means but as persons that had an opportunity of showing their detestation of such practices and declaring how unworthy a thing it must be in any even the most remote to pass such treacherous designs without punishment 3 When the king had said this and the young men had not been produced to make any defence for themselves the assessors perceived there was no room for equity and reconciliation so they confirmed his authority And in the first place Saturni nus a person that had been consul and one of great dignity pronounced his sentence but with great moderation and trou ble and said That he condemned Herod s sons but did not think they should be put to death He had sons of his own and to put one s son to death is a greater misfortune than any other that could befall him by their means After him Saturninus sons for he had three sons that followed him and were his legates pronounced the same sentence with their fa ther  on the contrary Volumnius sentence was to inflict death on such as had been so impiously undutiful to their father and the greatest part of the rest said the same insomuch that the conclusion seemed to be that the young men were condemned to die Immediately after this Herod came away from thence and took his sons to Tyre where Nicolaus met him in his voyage from Rome of whom he inquired after he had related to him what had passed at Berytus what his sentiments were about his sons and what his friends at Rome thought of that matter His answer was That what they had determined to do to thee was impious and that thou oughtest to keep them in prison and if thou thinkest any thing farther necessary thou mayest indeed so punish them that thou mayest not appear to indulge thy anger more than to govern thyself by judgment but it thou inclinest to the milder side thou mayest absolve them lest perhaps thy misfortunes be rendered incurable and this is the opinion of the greatest part of thy friends at Rome 424 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XVI also Whereupon Herod was silent and in greiit thought fitlness and bid Nicolaus sail along with him 4 Now as they came to Caesarea every body was there talk ing of Herod s sons and the kingdom was in suspense and the people in great expectation of what would become of them for a terrible tear seized upon all men lest the ancient disorders of the family should come to a sad conclusion and they were in great trouble about their sufferings nor was it without danger to say any rash thing about this matter nor even to hear another saying it but men s pity was forced to be shut up in themselves Â vhich rendered the excess of their sorrow very irksome but very silent yet was there an old soldier of Herod s whose name was Tero who had a son of the same age with Alexander and his friend who was so very free as openly to speak out what others silently thought about that matter and was forced to cry out often among the multitude and said in the most unguarded manner That truth was perished and justice taken away from men while lies and ill will prevailed and brought such a mist before public affairs that the offenders were not able to see the greatest mischief that can befall men And as he was so bold he seemed not to have kept himself out of danger by speaking so freely but the reasonableness of what he said moved men to regard him as having behaved himself with great manhood and this at a proper time also for which reason every one heard what he said with pleasure and although they first took care of their own safety by keeping silent themselves yet did they kindly receive the great freedom he took for the expectation they were in of so great an affliction put a force upon them to speak of Tero whatsoever they pleased 5 This man had thrust himself into the king s presence with the greatest freedom and desired to speak with him by himself alone which the king permitted him to do where he said this Since I am not able O king to bear up under so great a con cern as I am under I have preferred the use of this bold li berty that I now take which may be for thy advantage if thou mind to get any profit by it before my own safety Whither is thy understanding gone and left thy soul empty Whither is that extraordinary sagacity of thine gone where  by thou hast performed so many and such glorious actions f Whence comes this solitude and desertion of thy friends and relations Of which I cannot but determine that they are neither thy friends nor relatic ns while they overlook so hor rid wickedness in thy once happy kingdom Dost not thou perceive what is doing Wilt thou slay these two young men born of thy queen who are accomplished with every virtue in the highest degree aiH leave thyself destitute in thy old Chap XI ASTIO_UITIES or iht JEWS age but exposed to one son who hath very ill managed the hopes thou hast given him and to relations whose ci jath thou hast so often resolved on thyself Dost not thou take notice that the very silence of the multitude at once sees the crime and abhors the fact The whole army and the officers have commiseration on the poor unhappy youths and hatred to those that are the actors in this matter These words the king heard and for some lime with good temper But what cim one say When Tero plainly touched upon the bad beha viour and perfidiousness of his domestics he was moved at it but Tero went on farther and by degrees used an unbounded military freedom of speech nor was he so well disciplined as to accommodate himself to the time So Herod was greatly dis turbed and seeming to be rather reproached by this speech than to be hearing what was for his advantage while he learned hereby that both the soldiers abhorred the thing he was about and the officers had indignation at it he gave orders that all whom Tero had named and Tero himself should be bound and kept in prison 6 When this was over one Trypho who was the king s barber took the opportunity and came and told the king that Tero would often have persuaded him that when he trimmed him with a razor to cut his throat for that by this means he should be among the chief of Alexander s friends and receive great re wards from him When he had said this the king gave order that Tero and his son and the barber should be tortured which was done accordingly but while Tero bore up himself his son seeing his father already in a sad case and had no hope of deliverance and perceiving what would be the consequence of his terrible sufferings said that if the king would free him and his father from these torments for what he should say he would tell the truth And when the king had given his word to do so he said that there was an agreement made that Tero should lay violent hands on the king because it was easy for him to come when he was alone and that if when he had done the thing he should suffer death for it as was not unlikely it would be an act of generosity done in favour of Alexander This was what Tero s son said and thereby freed his father from the distress he was in but uncertain it is whether he had been thus forced to speak what was tiv c or whether it were a contrivance of his in order to procure his own and his father s deliverance from their miseries 7 As for Herod if he had before any doubt about the slaugh ter of his sons there was now no longer any room left in his soul for it but he had banished away whatsoever might afford him the least suggestion of reasoning better about this matter so be 426 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XVI already made haste to bring his purpose to a conclusion He al so brought out three hundred of the officers that were under an accusation as also Tero and his son and the barber that accused them before an assembly and brought an accusation against them all whom the multitude stoned with whatsoever came to hand and thereby slew them Alexander and also Aristobulus were brought to Sebaste by their father s command and there strang led but their dead bodies were in the night time carried to Alexandrium where their uncle by the mother s side and the greatest part of their ancestors had been deposited 8  And now perhaps it may not seem unreasonable to some that such an inveterate hatred might increase so much on both sides as to proceed farther and overcome nature but it may justly deserve consideration whether it be to be laid to the charge of the young men that they gave such an occasion to their fa ther s anger and led him to do what he did and by going on long in the same way put things past remedy and brought him to use them so unmercifully or whether it be to be laid to the fa ther s charge that he was so hardhearted and so very tender in the desire of government and of other things that would tend to his glory that he would take no one into a partnership with him that so whatsoever he would have done himself might continue immoveable or indeed whether fortune have not greater power than all prudent reasonings Whence we are persuaded that hu man actions are thereby determined beforehand by an inevit able necessity and we call her Fate because there is nothing which is not done by her wherefore I suppose it will be suffi cient to compare this notion with that other which attributes somewhat to ourselves and renders men not unaccountable for the different conducts of their lives which notion is no other than the philosophical determination of our ancient law Ac cordingly of the two other causes of this sad event any body may lay the blame on the young men who acted by youthful vanity and pride of their royal birth that they should bear to hear the calumnies that were raised against their father while certainly they were not equitable judges of the actions of his life but ill natured in suspecting and intemperate in speaking of it and on both accounts easily caught by those that observed them and revealed them to gain favour yet cannot their father be thought worthy excuse as to that horrid impiety which he was guilty of about them while he ventured without any cer tain evidence of their treacherous designs against him and without any proofs that they had made preparation for such  The reader is here to note that this eighth section is entirely wanting in the uld Lntin version as Spanheim truly observes

the great darlings of other men and no way deficient in their conduct whether it were in hunting or in warlike exer cises or in speaking upon occasional topics of discourse for in all these they were skilful and especially Alexander who was the eldest for certainly it had been sufficient even though he had condemned them to have kept them alive in bonds or to let them live at a distance from his dominions in banishment while he was surrounded by the Roman forces which were a strong security to him whose help would prevent his suffering any thing by a sudden onset or by open force but for him to kill them on the sudden in order to gratify a passion that go verned him was a demonstration of insufferable impiety he also was guilty of so great a crime in his older age nor will the delays that he made and the length of time in which the thing was done plead at all for his excuse for when a man is on a sudden amazed and in commotion of mind and then commits a wicked action although this be a heavy crime yet is it a thing that frequently happens but to do it upon deliber ation and after frequent attempts and as frequent puttings off to undertake it at last and accomplish it was the action of a murderous mind and such as was not easily moved from that which is evil And this temper he showed in what he did af terward when he did not spare those that seemed to be the best beloved of his friends that were left wherein though the justice of the punishment caused those that perished to be the less pitied yet was the barbarity of the man here equal in that he did not abstain from their slaughter also but of those per sons we shall have occasion to discourse more hereafter END OF VOLUME SECOND 3 H 29  B89096178488A
