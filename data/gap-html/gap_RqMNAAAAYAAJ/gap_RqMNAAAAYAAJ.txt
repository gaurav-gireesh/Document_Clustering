the state of affairs in Spain In Italy the consul Marcellus after regaining possession of Salapia which was betrayed into his hands took by storm Maronea and Meles cities belonging to the Samnites He made prisoners three thousand of Han nibal s soldiers left in garrison the booty which was considerable was given up to the soldiers here were found also two hundred and forty thousand pecks of wheat and one hundred and ten thousand of barley But the joy occasioned hereby was much less than the grief felt for an overthrow a few days after near the city of Herdonea Cneius Fulvius proconsul lay there encamped in hopes of recovering that city which after the defeat at Cannas had revolted from the Bomans but his post was neither strong by na ture nor secured by proper guards The negligence natural to that commander s disposition was increased by perceiving that the inhabitants as soon as they heard that Hannibal after the loss of Salapia had withdrawn from that part of the country into Bruttium began to waver in their attachment to the Carthagi nians Intelligence of all these particulars was con veyed to Hannibal by private messengers from Herdo nea and while it made him anxious to preserve an allied city at the same time inspired hopes of attack ing the enemy unprepared With his troops there LIV VOL V A  2 LIVY fore lightly equipped for expedition he hastened to Herdonea by such long marches that he almost anti cipated the report of his approach and to strike the greater terror he advanced in order of battle The Roman commander fully equal to him in boldness but inferior in judgment and strength hastily led out his forces and engaged him The fifth legion and the left wing of allied infantry commenced the fight with vigor But Hannibal gave directions to his ca valry that as soon as the lines of infantry should have their thoughts and eyes intirely occupied on the con test between themselves they should ride round that one half of them should fall on the enemy s camp and the other on the rear of their troops that were engaged With a sneer on the name of Fulvins he assured them that as he had utterly defeated him in the same coun try two years before the present battle would have a similar issue Nor was this expectation ill grounded for after many of the Romans had fallen in the close conflict between the lines of infantry the companies and battalions nevertheless still maintaining their ground the tumult raised by the cavalry in the rear and the enemy s shout from the camp which was heard at the same time put to flight the sixth legion which being posted in the second line was thrown into disorder by the Numidians as were afterwards the fifth and those in the van Some fled in hurry and confusion the rest were surrounded and slain among whom fell Cneius Fulvius himself with eleven military tribunes How many thousands of the Ro mans and allies were slain in that battle who can posi tively affirm when I find in some historians thirteen thousand in others not more than seven The con queror possessed himself of the camp and the spoil Having discovered that Herdonea was disposed to re volt to the Romans and would not continue faithful to him after his departure he removed the inhabitants to Metapontum and Thurium and burned the city to the ground The leaders of the party who were found to have held secret conference with Fulvius he put to HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXVII 3 death The Romans who escaped the slaughter of this disastrous day fled half armed by different roads into Samnium to the consul Marcellus 2 Marcellus not too much dismayed by so great a disaster wrote to Rome to the senate an account of the general and army being lost at Herdonea adding that notwithstanding this misfortune  he who had quelled the haughty spirit of Hannibal when his confidence was at the highest in consequence of his victory at Cannae was now going against him with the same degree of resolution and would take effectual care that his present joy and exultation should be short At Rome as people s grief for the past was great so were their fears of the future The consul passing over from Samnium into Lucania pitched his camp at Numistro on level ground within view of Hannibal who was posted on a bill He gave besides another proof of confidence in his own strength for he was the first to offer battle nor did Hannibal on seeing the standards advance through the gates decline the chal lenge However they drew up their forces in such a manner that the right wing of the Carthaginians stretched up the hill and the left wing of the Romans was brought close to the town From the third hour the action had lasted until night and the fatigue of fighting for such a length of time had overpowered the foremost lines consisting on the side of the Romans of the first legion and the right wing of allies on Hannibal s side of the Spanish infantry Balearic slingers and the elephants which at the beginning of the engagement had been brought into the field And now the fight flagged for a considerable time neither party having gained any advantage when the third legion advanced into the place of the first and the left wing of the allies into that of the right on the side of the enemy likewise the wearied were relieved by fresh troops On this both parties being in full spi rits and vigor instead of the former languid efforts a furious conflict at once arose but night separated the combatants before the victory could be decided Next 4 LIVY morning the Romans stood in order of battle from sunrise during a great part of the day  and none of the enemy coming out to face them gathered the spoils at their leisure and collecting the bodies of their slain into one spot burned them on a funeral pile In the following night Hannibal decamped in silence and marched off towards Apulia but as soon as daylight discovered the enemy s flight Marcellus leaving his wounded at Numistro with a small garrison the com mand of which he gave to Lucius Furius Purpureo a military tribune set out immediately in close pursuit and overtook him at Venusia Here during several days many skirmishes happened between parties sal lying from the outposts in which infantry and cavalry were intermixed and which produced more noise and tumult than real advantage to either side but which in general terminated in favor of the Romans From thence the two armies marched through Apulia with out any engagement of consequence for Hannibal seeking opportunities for stratagems removed always by night Marcellus never following but in clear day light and after having carefully examined the country through which he was to pass 3 Meanwhile as Flaccus was spending much time at Capua in selling the property of the nobility and setting to farm the forfeited estates all of which he let for a rent of corn he was furnished with a fresh occa sion for practising severity on the Campanians for he received certain information of a wicked scheme of an extraordinary nature which had for some time been hatching in secret Having removed the soldiers out of the houses for two reasons first because he chose that the houses of the city should be held along with the lands and next because he feared lest excessive luxury might enervate his army as it had that of Hannibal he had made them build huts for them selves in the military manner near the gates and walls Now most of these were formed of hurdles or boards some of reeds interwoven and all of them co vered with straw as if purposely intended for combus HISTORY OF ROME BOOK XXVII 5 tion One hundred and seventy Campanians at the head of whom were two brothers of the name of Blo sius had conspired to set fire to all these at one hour of the night But the design was discovered by some slaves belonging to the Blosii whereon the gates be ing instantly shut by order of the proconsul and the soldiers having on the signal being given assembled under arms all who were concerned in the conspiracy were seized and after undergoing a severe examina tion by torture condemned and put to death The informers were rewarded with their freedom and ten thousand asses each The Nucerians and Acerrans having complained that they had no place of habita tion as Acerra was partly burned and Nuceria demo lished Fulvius sent them to Rome to the senate Permission was granted to the Acerrans to rebuild what had been thus destroyed and the Nucerians agreeably to their own choice were transplanted to Atella the inhabitants of the latter being ordered to remove to Calatia Among the multiplicity of im portant affairs some prosperous others adverse which occupied the thoughts of the public even the citadel of Tarentum was not forgotten Marcus Ogul uius and Publius Aquilius being commissioned for the purpose went into Etruria to purchase corn which was to be conveyed to Tarentum and together with the corn were sent thither as a reinforcement to the garrison one thousand men out of the city troops consisting of equal numbers of Romans and allies 4 The summer was now nearly elapsed and the time of the consular election drew nigh but a letter received from Marcellus affirming that it would be in jurious to the public interest if he were to depart a step from Hannibal who was retreating before him while he by a close pursuit distressed him materially threw the senate into some perplexity as they were unwilling either to call home the consul at a time when he was most actively employed against the ene 321 5s iOd 6 LIVY my or to let the year pass without consuls It was judged most advisable though the other consul Vale rius was abroad that he should rather be recalled and even from Sicily Accordingly in pursuance of an order of the senate a letter was sent to him by Lu cius Manlius pretor of the city and together with it that of the consul Marcellus that from them he might perceive the reason which induced the senate to re call him from his province rather than his colleague About this time ambassadors came to Rome from king Syphax with a recital of all the successful battles which he had fought against the Carthaginians and assurances that their king entertained not a more in veterate enmity to any nation than to the Carthagi nian nor a more warm friendship for any than for the Roman adding that he had before sent embassies into Spain to the Roman generals Cneius and Pub lius Cornelius and that he now wished to seek as it were at the fountain head the friendship of the Romans The senate not only answered his ambas sadors with kindness but sent others in return charged with presents to the king these were Lucius Genucius Publius Postelius and Publius Popilius The presents which they carried were a purple gown and vest an ivory chair and a golden bowl of five pounds weight They received orders also to proceed to visit other chief tains of Africa carrying with them donatives of gowns with purple borders and golden bowls weighing three pounds each To Alexandria also were sent Marcus Atilius and Manius Acilius in embassy to king Pto lemy Philopater and queen Cleopatra to revive and renew the former treaty of friendship bearing with them a purple gown and vest with an ivory chair for the king an embroidered gown and a purple robe for the queen During this summer many prodigies were reported from the neighboring cities and country that at Tusculum a lamh was yeaned with its udder full of milk and that the temple of Jupiter was struck on the roof by lightning and almost intirely stripped of its covering that at Anagnia about the same time HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXVII 7 the ground before one of the gates was fired and with out the aid of any combustible matter continued burning a day and a night that at Compitum in the district of Anagnia the birds forsook their nests on the trees in the grove of Diana that near the mouth of the har bor of Tarracina snakes of wonderful size were seen in the sea and sporting like fishes that at Tarquinii a pig was littered which had a human face and that in the district of Capena at the grove of Feronia four statues sweated blood profusely for a day and a night These evil omens were expiated with victims of the greater kind in conformity to the order of the pontiffs and a supplication was ordered to be performed at all the shrines one day at Rome and another in the dis trict of Capena at the grove of Feronia 6 The consul Marcus Valerius on receipt of the letters by which he was summoned home gave up the command of the province and the army to the pretor Cincius sent Marcus Valerius Messala commander of the fleet with half of the ships to Africa to plunder the country and at the same time to gain intelligence of the motions and intentions of the Carthaginians then he set out himself with ten ships and arriving at Rome after a prosperous voyage immediately con vened the senate Here he recited the services which he had performed that after hostilities had been carried on in Sicily and many severe losses sustained on land and sea during almost sixty years he had brought the war to a final termination That there was not one Carthaginian in Sicily nor one Sicilian of those who had been compelled by fear to fly and live abroad who was not then at home that all had been reinstated in the possession of their own cities and estates and were employed in ploughing and sow ing that the land after having been long deserted was at length filled again with inhabitants and in a condition both to afford plenty to its occupiers and the most certain supplies of provisions to the Roman peo ple either in peace or war After this Mutines and such others as had deserved well of the Roman peo 8 LIVY ple were introduced to the senate who to fulfil the engagements of the consul bestowed rewards on them all Mutines was even made a Roman citizen an order for that purpose being proposed to the commons by a plebeian tribune in pursuance of directions from the senate While these matters passed at Rome Marcus Valerius Messala with fifty ships arriving on the coast of Africa before day made an unexpected descent on the lands of Utica which he ravaged to a great extent and after taking many prisoners and other booty of every kind reimbarked set sail for Sicily and returned to Lilybasum on the thirteenth day after he had left it On examining the prisoners the following particulars were discovered and all in order communicated by letter to the consul Laevinus that he might know the real state of affairs in Africa That there were at Carthage five thousand Numi dians commanded by Massinissa son of Gala a young man of a very enterprising spirit and that people were employed in all parts of Africa in hiring other troops which were to be sent to Spain to Hasdrubal in order that with the most numerous army which he could muster and with all possible expedition he might pass over into Italy and join Hannibal That on this measure the Carthaginians placed all their hopes of success That besides this they were fitting out a very great fleet for the recovery of Sicily and that the prisoners believed it would sail thither in a very short time When the letter containing this in formation was read it made so great an impression on the senate that they all concurred in opinion that the consul ought not to wait for the elections but to nomi nate a dictator to hold them and return without delay to his province This plan was obstructed by a dis pute which arose for the consul declared that he would nominate dictator Marcus Valerius Messala who was then in Sicily commanding the fleet but the senate insisted that a dictator could not be nominated who was in any place out of the Roman territory which extended not beyond the limits of Italy Mar HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXVII 9 cus Lucretius plebeian tribune proposing the ques tion hereon the senate decreed thus That the con sul before he left the city should consult the people as to whom they wished to be appointed dictator and should nominate to that office whomsoever they should order That if he refused this the pretor should hold the meeting and if he also were unwilling to do it that then the tribunes should propose the question Valerius declared that he would not ask the judgment of the people on a matter properly belonging to his own jurisdiction and he forbade it in the pretor on which the plebeian tribunes proposed the question and the commons ordered that Quintus Fulvius then at Capua should be created dictator But in the night preceding the day on which the assembly of the people was to be held the consul went off privately to Sicily and the senate left thus unsupported took the reso lution of ordering a letter to be sent to Marcus Clau dius desiring him to give assistance to the common wealth which his colleague had deserted and to nomi nate the dictator fixed on by the people Accordingly  Quintus Fulvius was nominated dictator by the con sul Claudius and in compliance with the same order of the people the dictator Quintus Fulvius named Publius Licinius Crassus then chief pontiff master of the horse 6 The dictator on coming to Rome sent Cneius Sempronius lilassus who had been a lieutenant general under him at Capua into the province of Etruria to take the command of the army there in the room of the pretor Caius Calpurnius whom he called away by letter to command his own army at Capua He ap pointed for the elections the earliest day on which they could be held but a dispute arising between the dictator and the tribunes they could not be finished on that day The younger Galerian century having obtained by lot the privilege of voting first named as consuls Quintus Fulvius and Quintus Fabius and the centuries voting in their course would have fol lowed them had not two plebeian tribunes Caius and 10 LIVY Lucius Arennius interposed They asserted that the re electing of the same person to the supreme magis tracy was not easily reconcilable to the principles of a republic and much more pernicious would the pre cedent be if the very person who presided at the elec tion were himself to be chosen If therefore the dic tator admitted his own name in the list of candidates they would protest against the election but if he re ceived on the list any other except himself they would give no obstruction to the business The dictator maintained the propriety of the proceedings of the as sembly on the grounds of a vote of the senate an order of the people and several precedents for  in the consulate of Cneius Servilius wheu the other con sul Cains Flaminius had fallen at the Thrasymenus the question was by direction of the senate proposed to the people and the people ordered that so long as the war continued in Italy it should be lawful for them to re elect to the consulship and that as often as they should see proper any of those who had already held that office As to precedents in point he had one of ancient date in the case of Lucius Postumius Me gellus who while be was interrex was in the assem bly where he himself presided created consul with Caius Junius Bubulcus and a recent one in the case of Quintus Fabius who certainly would never have suffered himself to be re elected if it were inconsistent with the public good After long dispute maintained by these arguments an agreement at last took place between the dictator and the tribunes to abide by the determination of the senate The senators were of opinion that the present state of the commonwealth was such as required that the administration of its affairs should be in the hands of experienced com manders skilled in all the arts of war and they therefore disapproved of any opposition to the pro ceedings of the assembly of election The tribunes then acquiesced and the election proceeded Quintus Fabius Maximus a fifth time and Quintus Fulvius Flaccus a fourth were declared consuls The follow HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXVII 11 ing persons were then elected pretors Lucius Veturius Philo Titus Quintius Crispinus Caius Hostilius Tu bulus Caius Arunculeius As soon as the appoint ment of magistrates for the year was finished Quintus Fulvius resigned the dictatorship Towards the end of this summer a Carthaginian fleet of forty ships under the command of Hamilcar sailed over to Sar dinia and committed great depredations in the dis trict of Olbia Afterwards on the pretor Publius Manlius Vulso appearing there with an army they proceeded to the other side of the island and ravaged the lands of Caralita from whence they returned with booty of all kinds to Africa Several Roman priests died this year and others were substituted in their places Caius Servilius was made a pontiff in the room of Titus Otacilius Crassus Tiberius Sempro nius Longus son of Tiberius an augur in the room of Otacilius Crassus and the same Tiberius Sempronius a decemvir for directing religious rites in the room of Tiberius Sempronius Longus son of Caius Marcus Marcius king in religious matters and Marcus jEmi lius Papus chief curio died but their places were not filled up during this year Lucius Veturius Philo and Publius Licinius Crassus chief pontiff were cre ated censors for the year Licinius Crassus had not before this appointment been either consul or pretor but was advanced at one step from the edileship to the censorship However these censors neither chose a senate nor transacted any public business being prevented by the death of Lucius Veturius on which Licinius abdicated the office The curule ediles Lu cius Veturius and Publius Licinius Varus repeated the exhibition of the Roman games once The plebeian ediles Quintus Catius and Lucius Porcius Licinius out of the money accruing from fines erected brazen statues in the temple of Ceres and exhibited games with much magnificence and splendor considering the circumstances of those times  7 At the end of the year Caius Laelius Scipio s lieutenant general on the thirty fourth day after he IS LIVY set sail from Tarraco arrived at Rome and passing through the streets with the train of prisoners whom he hrought attracted a vast concourse of people Next day being introduced to the senate he delivered the advices with which he was charged that Carthage the metropolis of Spain had been reduced in one day several revolted cities brought back to obedience and new alliances formed with others From the prisoners information was gained corresponding in general with that contained in the letter of Marcus Valerius Mes sala What gave the greatest uneasiness to the senate was Hasdrubal s intended march into Italy which was scarcely able to withstand Hannibal and the force which he had already with him Laelius also coming out into the general assembly gave a similar account The senate in consideration of the services performed by Publius Scipio decreed a supplication for one day and then ordered Caius Laelius to return with all expe dition to Spain with the ships which he had brought thence On the authority of a great many historians I have fixed the taking of Carthage in this year al though I am not ignorant that several have placed it in the year following but it appeared to me very impro bable that Scipio should have passed a whole year in Spain without doing any thing A U C 543 B C 209 The consulate of Quintus Fabius Maximus a fifth time and Quintus Fulvius Flaccus a fourth com mencing on the ides of March a decree was passed on the same day appointing Italy the province of both but they were to command separately in different quar ters Fabius to conduct the operations of the war at Tarentum Fulvius in Lucania and Bruttium Marcus Claudius was continued in command for a year The pretors then cast lots for their provinces Caius Hos tilius Tibullus obtained the city jurisdiction Lucius Veturius Philo the foreign with Gaul Titus Quintius Crispinus Capua and Caius Arunculeius Sardinia The troops were distributed among the provinces in this manner to Fulvius were decreed the two legions which Marcus Valerius Laevinus had in Sicily to HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXVII 13 Quintns Fabius those which Cains Calpurnius had commanded in Etruria the city troops were to re place those in Etruria and Caius Calpurnius was to command the same province with the army Titus Quintius was to have the government of Capua with the army which had served there under Quintus Ful vius Lucius Veturius was to receive from Caius Las torius propretor the province of Ariminum with the army then on the spot to Marcus Marcellus were as signed the legions with which he had in his consulate acted successfully to Marcus Valerius in conjunc tion with Lucius Cincius for they also were continued in command in Sicily the troops of Cannae were given with orders to complete their full complement out of the surviving soldiers of Cneius Fulvius legions These were collected together and sent by the consuls into Sicily being stigmatised by the same ignominious order under which the troops of Cannae served and those of the army of the pretor Cneius Fulvius whom the senate through resentment at the like cowardice had formerly ordered thither To Caius Arunculeius were assigned for Sardinia the same legions which had served in that province under Publius Manlius Vulso Publius Sulpicius was continued in command for a year to hold the province of Macedonia and with the same legion and the same fleet which he then had Thirty quinqueremes were ordered to be sent from Sicily to Tarentum to Quintus Fabius the consul and with the rest of the fleet Marcus Valerius Laevi nus was either to sail over to Africa himself to ravage the country or to send thither Lucius Cincius or Mar cus Valerius Messala With respect to Spain no change was made only that Scipio and Silanus were continued in command not for a year but until they should be recalled by the senate Such was the distribution made of the provinces and of the commands of the armies for that year 8 Among other business of more serious importance the assembly convened for the purpose of electing to the priesthood a chief curio in the room of Marcus 14 LIVY lEmilius revived an old dispute  for the patricians in sisted that Caius Mamilius Vitulus the only plebeian candidate ought not to be allowed to stand because none but a patrician had ever held that office of the priesthood The tribunes being appealed to referred the business to the senate The senate voted that the people might act therein as they should think proper Thus Caius Mamilius Vitulus was elected chief curio being the first plebeian admitted into that office Pub lius Licinius chief pontiff compelled Caius Valerius Flaccus against his will to be inaugurated flamen of Jupiter Caius Lsetorius was created decemvir for the performance of religious rites in the room of Quintus Mucius Scaevola deceased I should willingly pass over in silence the reason of the flamen being forced into the office laboring as he then did under a bad character had he not afterwards acquired a very good one Caius Flaccus had spent his youth in idleness and debauchery and his vicious courses had drawn on him the displeasure of his own brother Lucius Flaccus and of his other relations and Publius Licinius was in hope of reclaiming him Indeed when his thoughts became engaged in the care of the sacrifices and re ligious performances he quickly made such a complete alteration in his conduct from what it had hitherto been that among all the young men of the time no one was held in higher esteem or more intirely ap proved by the principal patricians by his own family and by all This universal good character inspiring bim with a proper sense of his own worth he asserted a privilege which had for many years been laid aside on account of the unworthiness of former flamens that of having a seat in the senate On his coming into the senate house the pretor Lucius Licinius led bim out on which he appealed to the tribunes of the commons alleging that he only claimed an ancient privilege of his priesthood which was conferred on the office of flamen together with the purple bordered robe and the curule chair The pretor argued that such a right de pended not on the copies of annals rendered obsolete HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXVII 15 by their antiquity but on the customary practice of more recent times and that in the memory of their fathers and even grandfathers no flamen of Jupiter had been allowed it The tribunes thought it reason able that as the right had been suffered to fall into disuse through the inattention of former flamens the injury ensuing should affect only themselves and not the office and accordingly without any opposition from the pretor himself and with the universal appro bation of the senate and commons they introduced the flamen to a seat in the senate though all men were of opinion that his having attained his object was owing to the strict integrity of his conduct rather than to any privilege of the priesthood The consuls before they departed for their provinces raised two city legions and such a number of soldiers as was necessary to make up the complement of the other armies The force which hitherto had served in the city the consul Fulvius gave to his brother Caius Fulvius Flaccus lieutenant general with orders to march it into Etruria and to bring home to Rome the legions then in that province The other consul Fabius having collected the relics of Fulvius army which amounted to three thousand three hundred and thirty six men ordered his son Quintus Maximus to conduct them into Sicily to the proconsul Marcus Valerius and to receive from him the two legions and thirty quinqueremes The re moval of these legions out of the island made no dimi nution in respect either of strength or appearance in the force stationed in that province for besides two veteran legions completely recruited to their full com plement the proconsul had a great multitude of Nu midian deserters both horse and foot and he also en listed in his service those Sicilians who had served in the army of Epicydes and that of the Carthaginians men well experienced in war By annexing a part of these foreign auxiliaries to each of the Roman legions he preserved the appearance of two armies with one of which he ordered Lucius Cincius to guard that part of the island which was formerly the kingdom of Hiero 16 LIVY and with the other he himself took charge of the rest of it separated formerly by the boundaries of the Ro man and Carthaginian dominions He likewise made division of the fleet which consisted of seventy sail in order that they might extend their protection of the coasts round the whole circumference of the island Attended by the cavalry of Mutines he went in person through e ery part of the province to view the lands observe hat parts were cultivated and what were not comnr i ing or reproving the owners accordingly In conseC ence of his care in this particular such an abundance of corn was produced that besides sending a quantity to Rome he conveyed to Catana a sufficient supply for the army which was to be employed during the summer at Tarentum 9 But the transportation of those soldiers into Sicily the greater part of whom were Latines and allies was very near proving the cause of formidable disturbances so true it is that the issues of great affairs often depend on trivial circumstances for the Latines and allies in their meetings began to murmur that  they had now for ten years been drained by levies and contributions That generally every year they suffered great losses in the war Many were slain in the field many were cut off by sickness and that every one of their coun trymen enlisted as a soldier by the Romans was more effectually lost to them than if he were taken prisoner by the Carthaginians because the latter was sent back without ransom to his country whereas the other was ordered by the Romans out of Italy into banishment indeed rather than to military service The troops of Cannae were now growing old in that situation having been in it nearly eight years and would end their lives before the enemy whose strength was at the present in a state particularly florishing would retire out of Italy Jf veteran soldiers were not to return home and still new ones to be enlisted there would not in a short time be one of that description remaining Where fore it was become necessary before they should be reduced to the last degree of desolation and want to HISTORY OF RQME â BOOK XXVII 17 deny to the Romans that which particular circum stances alone would shortly render it impossible to grant If that people saw the allies cordially uniting in such a measure they certainly would think of making peace with the Carthaginians otherwise as long as Hannibal lived Italy would never be free from war Thus did they argue in their assemblies The Roman colonies were at this time thirty in number a of whom had ambassadors at Rome and twelve of  pre sented a remonstrance to the consuls stating  it they had not the means of furnishing the suppl S _f men and money These were Ardea Nepete Sutrium Alba Carseoli Cora Suessa Circeii Setia Cales Narnia and Iuteramna The consuls surprised at such an extraordinary declaration and wishing to deter them from the meditated secession to which end they sup posed that censure and reproof would be more effectual than gentle measures answered that  the expressions which they had dared to use were such as the consuls could not prevail on themselves to repeat in the senate for they contained not a refusal of military duty but an open defection from the Roman people They ad vised them therefore to return home instantly to con sult with their respective countrymen as if no step had yet been taken since their infamous design though disclosed in words had not proceeded to ac tion and to remind them that they were not natives of Campania or of Tarentum but of Rome That from thence they derived their origin and from thence were sent out into colonies into lands taken from ene mies for the purpose of increasing population and that consequently whatever duties children owe to parents these they owed to the Romans if they had any remains of natural affection or any regard for their mother country They desired them therefore to confer on the matter anew for that as to the mea sures which they had inconsiderately mentioned their tendency was to betray the Roman empire and to give up the conquest of it to Hannibal Though the con suls one after the other reasoned with them in this liv vot v B 18 LIVY manner for a long time yet the ambassadors were not in the least moved but replied that  they had nothing new to represent to the senate at home neither had that assembly grounds for new deliberation when they neither had men to be enlisted nor money to pay them The consuls finding them inflexible laid the affair before the senate and here it excited such serious apprehen sions in every mind that great numbers cried out that the ruin of the empire was at hand that the other colonies would act in the same manner so would the allies that all had conspired to betray the city of Rome to Hannibal 10 The consuls endeavored to console and encourage the senate telling them  the other colonies would main tain their allegiance and duty as heretofore and that even these which had swerved from their duty if am bassadors were sent round among them instructed to apply reproofs and not intreaties would be impressed with respect for the sovereign authority Having re ceived power from the senate to act and manage as they should see most conducive to the public good they began by sounding the dispositions of the other colonies and then summoning their ambassadors de manded of them in public whether they had their con tingents of soldiers ready according to the regulation To this Marcus Sextilius of Fregellae in behalf of the eighteen colonies made answer that  the soldiers were ready according to the regulation that if a greater number should be required they would bring them and that whatever else the Roman people should com mand or wish they would perform with zeal and dili gence That they wanted not sufficiency of means and had more than a sufficiency of inclination On this the consuls after premising that all the praises which themselves could bestow would be inadequate to their merits unless they were joined by the thanks of the whole body of the senate in full assembly desired them to accompany them into the senate house The senate complimented them by a decree conceived in the most honorable terms possible and then charged the consuls to conduct them into an assembly of the people also HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXVII IS and there among the many other important services which those colonies had performed to them and their ancestors to make proper mention of this recent in stance of their meritorious conduct towards the com monwealth Even now and after so many ages their names should not be lost in silence nor should they be defrauded of their due praise they were theseâ Signia Norba Saticulum Brundusium Fregellae Luceria Venusia Atlria Firma Ariminum on the coast of the other sea Pontia Paestum and Cosa and in the in land parts Beneventum jEsernia Spoletum Placen tia and Cremona Supported by these the Roman empire was enabled to stand and they received every mark of gratitude both in the senate and in the as sembly of the people The former ordered that no mention should be made of the other twelve depend encies which had refused to furnish their quota for the war and that the consuls should neither dismiss nor detain their ambassadors nor hold any communi cation with them such a tacit proof of displeasure was judged the most suitable to the dignity of the Roman people While the consuls were busy in expediting the other necessary preparations for the campaign it was resolved to draw out of the treasury the vicesimary gold that is to say a fund formed of the twentieth part of the value of slaves enfranchised which was re served for exigences of the utmost necessity There was drawn out accordingly to the amount of four thousand pounds weight of gold Of this were given to the consuls to Marcus Marcellus and Publius Sul picius proconsuls and to Lucius Veturius the pretor to whom the lots had given the province of Gaul five hundred pounds each and besides this there were given in particular charge to the consul Fabius one hundred pounds of gold to be carried into the citadel of Tarentum The remainder they employed in making contracts with ready money for clothing the army who were then serving in Spain with so much honor to themselves and to their commander  11 It was also resolved that before the consuls set 20 LIVY out from the city they should expiate several prodigies which had happened On the Alban mount a statue of Jupiter and a tree standing near the temple at Ostia a grove at Capua a wall and the temple of Fortune and at Sinuessa a wall and gate were struck by lightning Farther it was reported that the Alban water flowed in a bloody stream that at Rome in the cell of the temple of Fors Fortuna an image which was in the crown of the goddess fell from her head into her hands that an ox spoke at Privernum that a vulture while the forum was crowded flew down into one of the shops and that at Sinuessa an infant was born whose sex was doubtful such as are com monly called in Greek a language more manageable than ours particularly in the compounding of words Androgynes that a shower of milk fell and that a boy was born with the head of an elephant These prodigies were expiated with the larger kind of vic tims Orders were given for a supplication to be per formed at all the shrines and prayers to be offered during one day for the averting of misfortunes and a decree passed that the pretor Caius Hostilius should vow and celebrate the games of Apollo in like manner as they had of late years been vowed and celebrated At the same time the consul Quintus Fulvius held an assembly for the election of censors The censors chosen were men who had never yet been consuls Marcus Cornelius Cethegus and Publius Sempronius Tuditanus By direction of the senate the question was proposed to the people and the people ordered that these by their censorial authority should let to farm the lands of Campania The choosing of the se nate was delayed by a dispute between the censors about the nomination of the prince of it the making the choice had fallen by lot to Sempronius but Cor nelius alleged that he ought to observe the practice handed down from their ancestors which was to ap point as prince the person who in the list of censors stood the first of any then living and this was Titus Manlius Torquatus Sempronius maintained that when HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXVII 21 â the gods gave a person the lot of appointing they gave him at the same time full freedom of choice that he would act in this case agreeably to his own judgment and would name to the honor contended for Quintus Fabius Maximus whom he could prove to be the first of the whole Roman state even in Hannibal s opinion After a long dispute his colleague gave up the point and Sempronius chose the consul Quintus Fabius Maximus prince of the senate Then the list of the new senate was read in which eight were left out among whom was Lucius Caecilius Metellus infamous for having after the defeat at Cannes advised the abandonment of Italy In their review of the eques trian order also they censured every one concerned with him but the number disgraced on that account was very small From all the cavalry of the legions of Cannae then in Sicily and their number was great their horses were taken away To this they added another punishment in point of time  ordering that the campaigns which those men had served on horses given by the public should not intitle them to release but that they should serve during ten others on horses of their own They also searched for and discovered a great number who ought to be ranked in the cavalry and all of these who had been seventeen years old at the beginning of the war and had not served they disfranchised They then contracted for the repairs of the buildings round the forum which had been de stroyed by the fire â seven shops the shambles and the royal palace 12 Having finished the necessary business at Rome the consuls set out for the campaign Fulvius first went forward to Capua in a few days after Fabius followed and he earnestly intreated his colleague in person and Marcellus by letter to make the most vigorous efforts to keep Hannibal employed while he should carry on the siege of Tarentum observing that when that city should be taken from the enemy who was already repailsed in every quarter and would then have no place where he conld rest or to which 22  LIVY he could retreat for safety he would not have even a pretence for staying longer in Italy He likewise sent an express to Rhegium to the commander of the body of troops which the consul Laevinus had placed there to act against the Bruttians and which consisted of eight thousand men all accustomed to live by plunder the greater part of whom had been brought out of Sicily from Agathyrna as was mentioned above To these were joined many natives of the country who deserted from the Bruttians equally daring and under equal necessity to dare every thing He ordered this band to be led first to ravage the lands of Bruttium and afterwards to besiege the city of Caulon These orders they executed not only with diligence but with avidity and after plundering the country and dis persing the inhabitants attacked the city with their utmost vigor Marcellus incited by his colleague s letter and also by an opinion which he had himself conceived that he was the only Roman general able to cope with Hannibal quitted his winter quarters as soon as forage could be found and met him at Canu sium The Carthaginian was at this time employed in endeavoring to entice the Canusians to a revolt but on hearing of Marcellus approach he decamped and re tired The country was open affording no cover for an ambuscade for which reason he resolved to draw back into more woody tracts Marcellus pressed close on his steps encamped within view of him and as soon as the trenches were finished drew out his legions and offered battle Hannibal sent out single troops of cavalry and the light spearmen from his infantry to skirmish with the enemy but did not think it advisable to risk the issue of a general engagement He was however drawn into a contest of that sort which he wished to avoid for although by marching away in the night he gained some ground of the enemy yet Marcellus overtook him in an open country and as he was forming his camp put a stop to his works by attacking the workmen on all sides In consequence of this a pitched battle ensued in which all the forces HISTORY OF ROME BOOK XXVII 23 on both sides were engaged but night coming on they separated without any advantage being gained on either side They then hastily before it grew dark fortified their camps at a very little distance from each other Next day as soon as light appeared Marcellus led out his forces to the field nor did Hannibal decline the contest but in a long speech exhorted his men to remember Thrasymenus and Cannae and to crush the presumption of the foe who pressed so closely on their steps not suffering them either to march or en camp in quiet or even to breathe or look about them  Every day the rising sun and the Roman army ap peared together on the plains But if the enemy should once be compelled to quit the field especially with some loss of blood they would afterwards conduc t their operations with less turbulence and violence Irritated by such expressions and at the same time vexed at being continually harassed on quitting their camp they began the fight with great fury The battle was maintained for more than two hours then on the Roman side the right wing and the chosen band called extraordinaries began to give ground on observing which Marcellus brought up the eighteenth legion to the front But while the others were retiring in con fusion and these advancing with but little alacrity into their place the whole line was disordered and in a little time totally broken at last fear getting the better of their shame they fairly turned their backs In this battle and the flight which followed there fell no less than two thousand seven hundred of the Ro mans and allies among these four Roman centu rions and two military tribunes Marcus Licinius and Marcus Fulvius Four military standards were lost by the wing which first fled and two by the legions which advanced in the place of the flying allies 13 After the army had retired into the camp Mar cellus reprimanded them in terms so harsh and bitter that they felt more from the discourse of their incensed commander than from all they had suffered in the un successful fight through the whole day He said to 24 LIVY them as matters have turned out I praise and thank the immortal gods that the victorious enemy did not assault our camp itself while you were hurrying into the gates and over the rampart in such utter dismay You would certainly have abandoned that through the same panic that made you give up the battle What fright is this What terror what forgetfulness both of your own character and that of your adversaries has at once seized your minds Surely they are the same enemies in defeating and pursuing of whom you spent the whole of the last summer who for some days past have fled before you night and day white you pressed on their rear whom yesterday you did not allow either to continue their march or to form their camp I say nothing of the advantages on which you ought to pride yourselves but will mention what of itself ought to fill you with shame and remorse yesterday you fought it out to the end on equal terms What alteration has last night what has this day made Have your forces been diminished have theirs been augmented I cannot persuade myself that I am speaking to my own army or to Roman soldiers The arms and appearances of the men are such as usual But if yon had possessed the usual spirit would the enemy have seen your backs Would he have carried off a standard from any one company or cohort Hi therto he has boasted of putting our legions to the sword you this day have been the first who have conferred on him the glory of putting a Roman army to flight On this the troops universally besought him to pardon their behavior of hat day and in treated him whenever he pleased to make another trial of the courage of his soldiers I will try you soldiers said he  and to morrow will lead you into the field that in the character of conquerors not of vanquished men you may obtain the pardon which you desire He then ordered that the cohorts which bad lost their standards should receive barley for their allowance and the centurions of the companies whose standards had been lost he deprived of their swords HISTORY OF ROME BOOK XXVII 26 commanding that all both infantry and cavalry should be ready under arms on the following day The as sembly was now dismissed all acknowleging that the reproofs which they had received were not more se vere than they deserved for that no person in the Roman army had that day behaved like a man ex cept the general alone to whom they ought to make atonement either by their death or by a glorious vic tory On the day following they attended according to orders armed and accoutred The general then commended them and said that  he would bring for ward into the first line those who had fled first the day before and the cohorts which had lost their stan dards that he now gave notice that it was incumbent on them to fight and to conquer and to exert them selves vigorously one and all to prevent the news of yesterday s flight reaching Rome before that of the present day s triumph They were then ordered to refresh themselves with food that in case the fight should last longer than usual they might have strength to go through it After every thing had been said and done to rouse the courage of the soldiers they marched out to the field 14 When this was told to Hannibal he said  We have to deal with an enemy who can neither bear good fortune nor bad if he gets the better he pursues the vanquished with presumption and vehemence if he is worsted he renews the contest with the victors Hie then ordered the signal to be sounded and led out his forces Both parties fought now with much more vigor than the day before the Carthaginians strug gling to maintain the glory acquired yesterday the Romans to remove their disgrace On the side of the Romans the left wing and the cohorts which had lost their standards fought in the front line while the twentieth legion was drawn up on the right wing Lucius Cornelius Lentulus and Cains Claudius Nero lieutenants general commanded the wings Marcellus himself took the charge of the centre that he might animate the men by his presence and be an immediate 26 LIVY witness of their behavior On Hannibal s side the front line was composed of the Spanish troops who were the main strength of his army When the fight had long continued doubtful Hannibal ordered the elephants to be brought up to the van hoping by their means to occasion fear and disorder At first they broke the ranks and by treading down some and ter rifying others on either side so as to put them to flight made an opening in the line in one part and the alarm would probably have spread farther had not Caius Decimius Flavus a military tribune snatch ing the standard of the first band of spearmen ordered that company to follow him He then led them to the spot where the elephants were throwing all into con fusion with directions to discharge their javelins at them Every weapon took place for there was no difficulty in hitting at a small distance bodies of such huge bulk especially as they were crowded close together But though they were not all of them wounded yet those in whose flesh the javelins stuck as they are creatures whose motions cannot be de pended on betaking themselves to flight drove back even those that were unhurt And now not any particular company alone but every soldier who could come np with the retreating elephants with all his might hurled javelins at them Thus attacked the more violently did the animals rush on their owners and made so much the greater carnage of them than they had made of the enemy as one of them when frightened or hurt is hurried on more forcibly than he could be driven by the manager sitting on his back While the enemy s line was in this great disorder in consequence of those beasts breaking through it the Romans made a brisk onset and without much oppo sition from troops so scattered and confused drove them off the ground Marcellus ordered his cavalry to charge them as they fled and the pursuit did not cease until they were driven in consternation into their camp for besides other circumstances which caused terror and tumult two elephants bad fallen in HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXVII 27 the very entrance of the gate so that the men were obliged to make their way over the trench and ram part Here the slaughter of the enemy was the great est There were killed no less than eight thousand men and five elephants Nor did the Romans gain the victory without loss of blood of the two legions about one thousand seven hundred were killed and of the allies above one thousand three hundred Great numbers both of Romans and allies were wounded In the following night Hannibal decamped and though Marcellus wished to pursue him he was prevented by his wounded which were in great number Scouts who were sent to observe his march brought intelli gence next day that Hannibal had taken the road to wards Bruttium 15 About the same time the Hirpinians Lucanians and Volscians surrendered themselves to the consul Quintus Fulvius delivering up Hannibal s garrisons which they had in their cities and were mildly re ceived by the consul with only a verbal reproof for their past errors Hopes of similar gentle treatment were held out to the Bruttians also through two bro thers Vibius and Pactius of the most illustrious fa mily of any in that nation who came to request the same terms of capitulation which were granted to the Lucanians The other consul Quintus Fabius took by assault Manduria a town in the territory of Sal lentum Here he made four thousand prisoners and gained much booty of other kinds Proceeding thence to Tarentum he pitched his camp at the very mouth of the harbor Of the ships which Livius had kept here for the purpose of protecting convoys he loaded part with machines and implements fit for assailing walls the rest he furnished with engines stones and missile weapons of every kind the storeships also not con fining himself to such only as were moved by oars be fitted out in the same manner in order that some might bring out the machines and ladders to the walls while the others from their ships at some distance should annoy with missile weapons the men employed in de 26 XiVY fending them These ships were thus fitted up and prepared for the purpose of an attack on that side of the city which is washed by the open sea which was now clear of the enemy for the Carthaginian fleet had sailed over to Corcyra at the time when Philip was preparing to attack the jEtolians Meanwhile the party which carried on the siege of Caulon in Bruttium hearing of Hannibal s approach and fearful of being overpowered retired to an eminence which though it secured them from an immediate attack was destitute of every other convenience In the prose cution of the siege of Tarentum Fabius received very great assistance towards the accomplishment of that important business from an incident trivial in appear ance the Tarentines had in the city a party of Brut tians given to them by Hannibal and the commander of this party was desperately in love with a young wo man whose brother was in the army of the consul Fabius This man being informed by a letter from bis sister of her new acquaintance with a stranger of so great wealth and so highly honored among his countrymen conceived hopes that by means of his sister her lover might be brought into any scheme and this project he communicated to the consul bis reasoning appeared not ill founded and he was ordered to go as a deserter into Tarentum Here being intro duced by his sister to the notice of the commander he began by artfully sounding his disposition and having satisfied himself that his temper was as tickle as he could wish by the aid of female blandishments be prevailed on him to betray the post of which he com manded the guard When both the method and the time for the execution of this design were settled the soldier was let out of the town privately through the intervals between the guards and related to the con sul what had been done and what was farther in tended At the first watch Fabius after giving pro per directions to the troops in the citadel and to those who had the guard of the harbor went himself quite round the harbor and sat down in concealment ou the HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXVII aide of the city facing the east The trumpets then be gan to sound at once from the citadel from the port and from the ships which had been brought to the shore on the side next to the open sea At the same time a shout was raised and a prodigious tumult purposely made on every side where there was very little danger Meanwhile the consul kept his men quiet and silent Democrates therefore who had formerly commanded the fleet and who happened now to command there perceiving every thing near him quiet while other parts resounded with tumult and shouting like that of a city stormed fearful lest while he hesitated the consul might force a passage and march in his troops carried off his party to the citadel because the most alarming noise proceeded from that quarter Fabius from the length of time and likewise from the silence which prevailed for where a little before there was an uproar among the men rousing each other and call ing to arms now not a word was heard imagined that the guard was withdrawn  he therefore ordered the ladders to be brought up to that part of the wall where according to the information of the contriver of the plot the cohort of Bruttians held the guard In this place favored and assisted by the Bruttians the Romans first gained possession of the wall over which they climbed into the city and then the nearest gate was broken open that the troops might march through in a body These entering the town a little before day raised a shout and without meeting any one in arms proceeded to the forum having drawn on themselves the attention of the combatants in every quarter whe ther at the citadel or the harbor 16 At the entrance of the forum a vigorous oppo sition was made but it was not persevered in A Ta rentine was no match for a Roman either in spirit in arms in warlike skill nor yet in vigor or bodily strength They only discharged their javelins and then scarcely waiting till the fight began turned their backs and as they were acquainted with the streets of the city ran different ways to their own houses or LIVY those of their friends Two of their commanders Nico and Democrates fell fighting courageously Philo menus who had been the author of the plot for be traying the city to Hannibal rode away from the fight at full speed his horse was not long after seen stray ing through the city without a rider but his body was never found and the general opinion was that he fell from his horse into an open well Carthalo as he was coming to the consul unarmed to remind him of their fathers being connected by ah intercourse of hospi tality was slain by a soldier who met him in the way The rest were put to the sword without distinction armed and unarmed Carthaginians and Tarentines alike Many even of the Bruttians were killed either through mistake or through the inveterate hatred borne towards them by the Romans or with design to discountenance the report of the place being betrayed and that it might rather appear to have been taken by force of arms After this carnage the victors pro ceeded in several parties to plunder the city We are told that there were here thirty thousand persons in a state of servitude a vast quantity of silver wrought and coined eighty seven thousand pounds weight of gold together with statues and pictures in such num bers as almost to rival the decorations of Syracuse But Fabius with more greatness of mind than was shown by Marcellus refrained from meddling with booty of that sort and when his secretary asked him what he would have done with the statues of their gods which were of gigantic size and habited like warriors he ordered him to let the Tarentines keep their angry gods to themselves Then the wall which separated the citadel from the town was demolished and rased Amid these transactions Hannibal having made prisoners the party employed in the siege of Caulon who capitulated hearing of the siege of Ta retitum marched night and day with all expedition to relieve it but while he was hastening thither he re ceived the news of its being taken On this he ob served the Romans too have their Hannibal we HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXVII 31 have lost Tarentum through the same arts by which we acquired it That he might not however seem to have turned back as in flight he encamped on the spot where he had halted about five miles from the city and after staying there a few days retreated to Me tapontum Prom hence he sent to Tarentum two Me tapontines with letters from the principal men in that state to Fabius to receive his promise of impunity for what was past on condition of their delivering Meta pontum and the Carthaginian garrison into his hands Fabius supposing the offer to be made with sincerity appointed a day on which he would come to Metapon tum and gave letters in answer which were delivered to Hannibal who overjoyed at the success of his stra tagem and at finding that even Fabius was not proof against artifice formed an ambuscade at a small dis tance from Metapontum As Fabius was taking the auspices previous to his departure from Tarentum the birds repeatedly refused the favorable signs also when he consulted the gods by sacrifice the aruspex warned him to beware of treachery and plots As he did not come on the appointed day the two Metapon tines were sent back to remove any scruple that re tarded him but being suddenly seized and dreading an examination by torture they disclosed the whole plot 17 In Spain in the beginning of the summer there came over to Scipio who had spent all the preceding winter in conciliating the affections of the barbarians partly by presents and partly by sending home their hostages and prisoners a person named Edesco a dis tinguished commander among the Spaniards This man s wife and children were in the hands of the Ro mans but besides this motive he was also actuated by that almost unaccountable propensity which had brought over all Spain from the Carthaginian interest to that of the Romans Led by the same motive In dibilis and Mandonius unquestionably the two first men in Spain with the whole body of their country men deserted Hasdrubal and withdrew to an emi 32 livy nence overlooking his camp from whence along a continued ridge of hills they could retire with safety to the Romans When Hasdrubal saw the enemy s strength increasing by such large accessions while his own was daily diminished and would probably unless by a bold effort he effected something continue to de cay in the same manner as it had begun be resolved to bring on a battle as soon as possible Scipio was even more desirous of an engagement as well because his hopes were strong in consequence of the success which had hitherto attended his affairs as because he wished to engage with a single general and his forces rather than with all together which be would perhaps be forced to do were they to unite However should he be under a necessity of fighting more than one army at once he had taken a judicious method to augment his strength for perceiving that there would be no employment for his marine as the coast of Spain was intirely clear of any Carthaginian fleet he hauled up the ships on land at Tarraco and joined the marines to his land forces As to arms for them he had abun dance between those taken at Carthage and those which had been afterwards made by the great number of workmen whom he employed With this force Scipio in the beginning of spring by which time he was rejoined by Laelius who had returned from Rome and without whom he undertook no enterprise of any extraordinary moment set out from Tarraco and ad vanced towards the enemy On his march during which he found every place well affected the allies showing him all respect and escorting him as he passed through each of their states he was met by Indibilis and Mandonius with their armies Indibilis spoke for both not with the ignorance and temerity of a barba rian but with a modest gravity appearing rather to apologise for their changing sides as a measure of necessity than to boast of it as if it had been greedily embraced on the first opportunity for he knew he said  that the term deserter was deemed dishonorable by a man s old associates and held in suspicion by the HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXVII 33 new nor did he blame men for this manner of think ing provided only that the merits of the case and not the mere name were made the grounds of this double aversion He then enumerated his services to the Carthaginian generals and on the other hand their avarice tyranny and ill treatment of every kind heaped on him and his countrymen For these reasons he said  his body only had hitherto been on their side his mind had long been on that side where he be lieved that respect was paid to laws divine and human To the gods themselves people have recourse with sup plications for redress when they can no longer endure the violence and injustice of men He intreated Sci pio not to consider their conduct as deserving either punishment or reward but to form his judgment on a trial of them from that day forward and by that stan dard to estimate the recompense which they might hereafter be thought to deserve The Roman an swered that he would comply with their desire in every particular and would not consider them in the light of deserters because they had not thought themselves bound to adhere to such an alliance when the other party scrupled not to violate every obligation divine and human Then their wives and children being brought into the assembly were restored to them and received with tears of joy That day they were enter tained in lodgings prepared for them  and on the next the terms of association were ratified and they were dismissed to bring up their forces afterwards they encamped in conjunction with the Romans until they conducted them to the spot where the enemy lay 18 The nearest army of the Carthaginians was that commanded by Hasdrubal which lay near the city of Baecula In the front of this camp he had posted ad vanced guards of cavalry On these the Roman light infantry the front rank and those who composed the vanguard instantly as they arrived and without wait ing to choose ground for a camp made an attack and with such apparent contempt as plainly demonstrated what degree of spirit each party possessed The ca LIV VOL V C 34 LIVY valry were driven within their works whither they tied in Confusion pressed almost to the very gates The action of that day having only whetted their ardor for a contest the Romans pitched their camp Has drubal during the night drew back his army to a hill the summit of which was spread out into a level plain on the Tear of the hill was a river and on the front and on either side it was encircled by a kind of steep bank at some distance below this lay another plain sloping downwards the circumference of which was likewise bounded by another bank of equally difficult ascent Into this lower plain Hasdrubal next day on seeing the enemy s line formed in front of their camp sent down his Numidian cavalry and the light armed Ba learians and Africans Scipio riding round the com panies and battalions desired them to observe that the enemy renouncing at once all hopes of being able to oppose them on plain ground endeavored to secure themselves on hills waiting within sight and confiding in the strength of their posts not in their valor and their arms But Roman soldiers had mounted the higher defences of Carthage Neither hills nor a citadel nor the sea itself had stopped the progress of their arms Those heights which the enemy had seized would answer no other purpose than that of compelling them in their flight to leap down crags and preci pices but he would prevent their escaping even in that way Accordingly he gave orders to two co horts that one of them should secure the entrance of the valley through which the river ran and that the other should block up the road which led from the city into the country across the declivity of the hill He then put himself at the head of the light troops which had the day before beaten the enemy s advanced guards and led them against the light armed forces posted on the brink of the lower descent For some time they proceeded over rough ground without meet ing any other obstacle than the difficulty of the way afterwards when they came within reach vast quanti ties of weapons of every sort were poured down on HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXVII 35 them while on their side not only the soldiers but a multitude of servants mixed among the troops as sailed the enemy with stones which they found every where scattered and which in general were of such a size as that they could be thrown by the hand But though the ascent was difficult and they were almost overwhelmed with darts and stones yet through the skill which they had acquired by practice in climbing walls and the obstinacy of their courage the foremost gained the summit When they got on ground that was any way level and where they could stand with firm footing they soon beat back the enemy who though light and fit for skirmishing and able enough to defend themselves at a distance while an uncertain kind of fight was waged with missive weapons yet when the matter came to close fighting were quite de ficient in steadiness so that they were driven with great slaughter into the line of troops posted on the higher eminence On this Scipio ordering the con querors to press forward against their centre divided the rest of the forces w th Laelius whom he ordered to go round the hill to the right until he should find a gentler ascent while he himself making a small cir cuit to the left charged the enemy in flank This at once threw their line into disorder though they at tempted to change the position of their wings and to face about their ranks towards the several shouts which assailed their ears from every quarter During this confusion Laslius also came up and the enemy by re treating through fear of being wounded from behind broke their front line and left an opening for the Ro man centre who never could have made their way up against ground so disadvantageous had the ranks re mained intire and the elephants kept their posts in the front of the battalions While numbers were slain in every quarter Scipio who with his left wing had charged the right of the enemy continued the attack with the greatest fury against their naked flank And now the Carthaginians had not even a passage open for flight for the Roman detachments had taken pos 36 LIVY session of the roads both on the right and left add to this that their commander and principal officers in en deavoring to make their escape filled up the gate of the camp while the disorderly rout of the frightened elephants were as terrible to them as were the enemy There were slain therefore not less than eight thou sand men 19 Hasdrubal had before the battle hastily sent off his treasure and now forwarding the elephants he collected the flying troops directing his course along the river Tagus towards the Pyrenees Scipio took possession of the Carthaginian camp and having bestowed on the soldiers all the booty except the per sons of free condition he found on taking an account of the prisoners ten thousand foot and two thousand horse Of these he sent home all the Spaniards with out ransom the Africans he ordered the qnestor to sell On this the multitude of Spaniards who stood around both those who had formerly surrendered and those taken the day before unanimously saluted him by the title of king But Scipio ordering the crier to command silence told them that to him the highest title was that of general which his soldiers had conferred on him that the title of king in other places highly respected was at Rome deemed odious They might indeed within their own breasts judge of him as possessing the spirit of a king if they deemed that the most honorable perfection in a human mind but they must refrain from the application of the name Even these barbarians were sensibly affected by the greatness of his mind that could look down contemp tuously on a title which from the rest of mankind at tracts wonder and admiration He then distributed presents among the petty princes and chieftains of the Spaniards desiring Indibilis to choose out of the great number of horses taken three hundred such as he liked While the questor in pursuance of the ge neral s order was selling off the Africans he observed among them a boy of extraordinary beauty and hear ing that he was of royal blood he sent him to Scipio HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXVII 37 Scipio asking him who and of what country he was and why at that early age he had been found in a camp V he told him that he was a Numidian called by his countrymen Massiva that being left an orphan by the death of his father he was educated in the fa mily of his maternal grandfather Gala king of Numi dia that he had come over into Spain with his uncle Masiuissa who had lately brought a body of cavalry to the assistance of the Carthaginians that he had never before been in a battle having been prohibited by Masinissa on account of his youth but that on the day of the engagement with the Romans he had pri vately taken a horse and arms and unknown to his uncle gone out into the field whereby his horse fall ing he was thrown to the ground and made a prisoner by the Romans Scipio ordering the boy to be taken care of finished what business was to be done at the tribunal then retiring into his pavilion he called the youth and asked him whether he wished to return to Masinissa To which the other his eyes suffused with tears of joy replied that above all things it was what he wished He then gave as presents to him a gold ring a vest with a broad purple border a Spanish cloak with a golden clasp likewise a horse fully ac coutred and ordering a party of horsemen to escort him as far as he chose sent him away 20 He then held a council to settle a plan of opera tions when many advised him without delay to go in pursuit of Hasdrubal but such a step he thought too hazardous lest Hasdrubal son of Gisgo and Mago should unite their forces with those of that commander Contenting himself therefore with sending some troops to occupy the passes of the Pyrenees he passed the remainder of the summer in receiving the submissions of the Spanish states Not many days after the battle fought at Baecula when Scipio on his return to Tar raco had just got clear of the pass of Castulo the two generals from the Farther Spain Hasdrubal son of Gisgo and Mago joined Hasdrubalâ a reinforcement too late the battle being lost but their coming was 38 LIVY very seasonable in another respect as it gave him the assistance of their counsel respecting the measures to be taken for the farther prosecution of the war On this occasion when they compared accounts of the dis positions of the Spaniards in each of their several pro vinces Hasdrubal son of Gisgo alone made a favor able report giving his opinion that the remote track of Spain which lies on the ocean and about Gades was as yet unacquainted with the Romans and there fore sufficiently well affected to the Carthaginians The other Hasdrubal and Mago agreed in pronouncing that the affections of all both in their public and private capacities were attached to Scipio by the kind treat ment which he gave them and that there would be no end of desertions until all the Spanish soldiers were either removed into the remotest parts of Spain or car ried away into Gaul Therefore though the Carthagi nian senate had passed no order for the purpose yet it was necessary that Hasdrubal should go into Italy where the principal stress of the war lay and where the final decision of it must be expected in order at the same time to carry away all the Spanish soldiers out of Spain and out of the way of hearing the name of Scipio that the Carthaginian army being greatly re duced as well by desertions as by the late unfortunate battle should be filled up with Spanish recruits that Mago giving up his forces to Hasdrubal son of Gisgo should go over in person to the Balearic islands with a large sum of money to hire auxiliaries that Has drubal son of Gisgo should with the remainder re tire into Lusitania and by no means come to an en gagement with the Romans that out of all their ef fective horsemen a body of three thousand cavalry should be made up for Masinissa to make excursions through what they called Hither Spain succor their allies and carry depredations through the towns and lands of the enemy Having determined on these measures the commanders separated to put their re solves in execution Such were the transactions of this year in Spain At Rome the reputation of Scipio HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXVII 39 rose higher every day The taking of Tarentum though effected by artifice rather than by courage yet gave some degree of glory to Fabius The lustre of Fulvius character began to fade Marcellus was even spoken of with displeasure because besides the failure in his first battle he had in the middle of summer while Hannibal was carrying his excursions through various parts of Italy drawn off his army to Venusia to lodge them in houses He had a bitter enemy in Caius Pub lius Bibulus a plebeian tribune this man ever since the battle which proved unfortunate had in frequent harangues represented Claudius in a dishonorable light endeavoring to render him odious to the com mons and he now proposed to deprive him of the command The friends of Claudius nevertheless pro cured an order that Marcellus leaving at Venusia a lieutenant general should come home to Rome to clear himself of those charges on which his enemies fouuded the resolutions which they proposed and that during his absence no step should be taken to wards divesting him of the command It so happened that Marcellus came to Rome to rescue his character from disgrace and the consul Quintus Fulvius to hold the elections at the same time 21 The business respecting Marcellus commission was debated in the Flaminian circus amidst a vast concourse of plebeians and people of all ranks The tribune of the commons brought forward heavy charges not only against Marcellus but against the whole body of the nobles  To their treacherous and dilatory con duct he said  it was owing that Hannibal now held possession of Italy as his province for the tenth year and passed more of his life there than in Carthage The Roman people now enjoyed the fruits of continuing Marcellus in command his army after being twice routed was spending the summer at Venusia and dwelling in houses instead of the camp These and such like invectives of the tribune Marcellus so tho roughly refuted by a recital of the services which he had performed that not only the question concerning 40 LIVY the annulling of his commission was negatived but on the day following every one of the centuries with the greatest unanimity concurred in electing him consul The colleague joined with him was Titus Quintius Cris pinus then a pretor Next day were elected pretors Publius Licinius Crassus Dives then chief pontiff Publius Licinius Varus Sextus Julius Cassar Quintus Claudius flamen During the very time of the elec tions the public were much disturbed with apprehen sions of a revolt in Etruria That some scheme of that kind had been set on foot by the Arretians was asserted in a letter of Caius Calpurnius who in the character of propretor held the government of that province Wherefore Marcellus consul elect was immediately despatched thither with orders to inquire into the affair and if he should see occasion to send for his army and remove the war from Apulia to Etruria The fear of this gave the Etrurians such a check as kept them quiet Ambassadors from the Tarentines came to so licit a treaty of peace requesting that they might be allowed to live in freedom under their own laws but the senate desired them to come again when the consul Fabius would have returned to Rome Both the Roman and plebeian games were this year repeated for one day The curule ediles were Lucius Cornelius Caudinus and Servius Sulpicius Galba the plebeian Caius Servilius and Quintus Caecilius Metellus Many people insisted that Servilius could not legally have held the office of tribune nor could now hold that of edile because it was well known that his father who for ten years was supposed to have been killed by the Boians near Mutina when triumvir for the distribu tion of lands was still living and in the hands of the enemy 22 In the eleventh year of the Punic war com menced the consulate of Marcus Marcellus a fifth time reckoning the consulship which because of an irregu larity in the election he did not hold and Titus Quin tius Crispinus It was decreed that both the consuls should be employed in Italy as their province and HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXVII 41 that out of the two consular armies of the preceding year with a third which was at Venusia and had been under the command of Marcellus the consuls were to choose whatever two they liked and the third was to be assigned to the commander to whose lot the proyince of Tarentum and Salentum should fall The other provinces were distributed in this manner with regard to the pretors the city jurisdiction was assigned to Publius Licinius Varus the foreign with such other employment as the senate should direct to Pub lius Licinius Crassus chief pontiff Sicily to Sextus Julius Caesar and Tarentum to Quintus Claudius Ha nsen Quintus Fulvius Flaccus was continued in com mand for the year and ordered with one legion to hold the government of the province of Capua which had been held by Titus Quintius when pretor Caius Hostilius Tubulus was likewise continued that as pro pretor he might succeed Caius Calpurnius in the com mand of the two legions in Etruria and Lucius Vetu rius Philo was continued that he might in quality of propretor retain the government of his present pro vince of Gaul with the same two legions which he had there when pretor With regard to Caius Auruncu leius who in his pretorship had with two legions held the government of the province of Sardinia the senate passed a decree in the same terms with that respecting Lucius Veturius but for the defence of that province an additional force was assigned him of fifty ships of war which Scipio was to send from Spain The business of continuing all these officers in com mand was laid before an assembly of the people To Publius Scipio and Marcus Silanus their present pro vince of Spain and the armies at present with them were decreed for the year An order was sent to Sci pio that out of eighty ships which he then hadâ some Drought with him from Italy some taken at Carthageâ he should send fifty over to Sardinia because a report prevailed that great naval preparations were going on at Carthage where the intention was to overspread the whole coasts of Italy Sicily and Sardinia with a fleet 43 LIVY of two hundred sail The business of Sicily was di vided thus the troops of Cannas were given to Sextus Caesar Marcus Valerius Laevinus for he also was continued in authority was to have the fleet of seventy ships which lay on the coast of that island To these were joined the thirty ships which had been at Taren tum the year before and with this fleet of one hun dred sail if he thought proper he was to pass over and make depredations on Africa Publius Sulpicius also was continued in command for the year that he might hold the province of Macedonia and Greece with the same fleet which he had before With respect to the two legions which remained in the city of Rome no alteration was made Leave was given for the con suls to raise recruits to complete the troops wherein there was any deficiency of numbers Twenty one le gions were employed this year in the service of the Roman empire A charge was given to Publius Lici nius Varus city pretor to repair thirty old ships of war which lay at Ostia and to furnish twenty new ones with their full complement of men that he might have a fleet of fifty sail to guard the sea coasts in the neighborhood of Rome Cains Calpurnius was for bidden to remove his army from Arretium before the arrival of his successor Both he and Tubero were ordered to be particularly watchful on that side lest any new schemes might be formed 23 The pretors went to the provinces but the con suls were detained by business respecting religion for they could not readily effect the expiation of se veral prodigies which had been reported From Cam pania accounts were brought that two temples at Ca pua those of Fortune and Mars and several tombs were struck by lightning and at Cumw mice gnawed some gold in the temple of Jupiter so apt is supersti tious weakness to introduce the deities into the most trivial occurrences that at Casinum a very large swarm of bees settled in the forum at Ostia a wall and gate were struck by lightning at Caere a vulture flew into the temple of Jupiter and that at Vulsinii HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXVII 43 blood flowed from a lake On account of these por tents there was a supplication performed of one day s continuance During many successive ones sacrifices were offered of victims of the larger kinds and yet no favorable omens appeared nor for a long time was there any indication of the gods becoming propitious The baneful events thus foreboded affected not im mediately the safety of the state but fell on the per sons of the consuls The Apollinarian games had been first celebrated by the city pretor Cornelius Sulla in the consulate of Quintus Fulvius and Appius Clau dius and thenceforward all the city pretors in suc cession had performed them but they vowed them only for one year and fixed no particular day for their observance This year a grievous epidemic disorder fell both on the city and country however the sick ness was rather tedious than mortal On account of this malady a supplication was performed in all the streets of Rome the city pretor Publius Licinius Va rus being at the same time ordered to propose to the people to enact a law that a vow should be made for the perpetual celebration of those games on a stated day Accordingly he himself first engaged for it holding the games on the third day of the nones of July which day has ever since been observed as an anniversary festival 24 The rumors concerning the Arretians grew every day more and more alarming and greatly in creased the anxiety of the senate wherefore orders were despatched to Caius Hostilius not to defer taking hostages from that people and Caius Terenlius Varro was sent with a commission to receive them from him and conduct them to Rome On his arrival Hosti lius immediately ordered one legion which was en camped before the gates to march into the city and then having posted guards in proper places he sum moned the senate to attend him in the forum and make a demand of hostages The senate requested two days time to consider the matter but he insisted that they should give them instantly or he would next 44 LIVY day take all the children of the senators He then di rected all the military tribunes prefects of the allies and centurions to guard the gates carefully that no one might go out of the city in the night This was not performed with proper care and diligence for before the guards were posted at the gates or night came on seven principal senators made their escape with their children At the first light on the day following the senate being summoned into the forum they were missed and their property was sold From the rest of the senators one hundred and twenty hos tages were received who were their own children and they were delivered to Caius Terentius to be con ducted to Rome He represented every thing to the senate in such a light as greatly increased their suspi cions wherefore as if the hostile intentions of the Etrurians were no longer to be doubted an order was given to Caius Terentius himself to lead one of the city legions to Arretium and to keep it there as a garrison to the city It was at the same time deter mined that Caius Hostilius with the rest of the troops should make a circuit through the whole province that those who wished to excite disturbances might have no opportunity of putting their designs in exe cution When Caius Terentius with the legion ar rived at Arretium and demanded from the magistrates the keys of the gates they told him that they were not to be found but he believing rather that they had been put out of the way through some evil design than lost through negligence put on new locks mak ing use of every precaution to keep all things under his own power He earnestly cautioned Hostilius not to expect to retain the Etrurians in quiet by any other means than by putting it out of their power to stir 25 About this time the business of the Tarentines occasioned a warm debate in the senate where Fabius was present exerting himself in favor of those whom he had subdued by arms while others spoke of them with much asperity charging them as equal in guilt and deserving equal punishment with the Campanians HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXVII 45 The senate resolved conformably to the opinion of Manius Acilius that the town should be secured by a garrison and all the Tareutines confined within the walls and that the business should be taken under consideration at a future time and when Italy should be in a state of greater tranquillity The case of Mar cus Livius governor of the citadel of Tarentum was also debated with no less warmth some advised to pass a vote of censure on him because that in conse quence of his indolence Tarentum had been betrayed to the enemy while others thought him deserving of reward for having defended the citadel for five years and for having singly been the principal cause of the recovery of Tarentum Moderate people affirmed that the cognisance of his conduct belonged to the censors not to the senate and of this opinion was Fabius nevertheless addingâ Livius was no doubt the cause of Tarentum being recovered as his friends have so often boasted in the senate but it should be borne in mind that it could not have been recovered if it had not been lost The consul Titus Quintius Crispinus marched with a reinforcement into Lucania to join the army formerly commanded by Quintns Fulvius Flaccus Marcellus was detained by several obstacles respecting religion which occurred in quick succession to disturb his mind one of which was that having in the battle with the Gauls at Clastidium vowed a temple to Honor and Virtue he had been hindered by the pontiffs from dedicating it for they insisted that one shrine could not with propriety be consecrated to more than one deity because if it should be struck with lightning or any kind of pro digy happen in it the expiation would be difficult as it could not be determined to which of the deities sa crifice ought to be made for one victim could not properly be offered to two divinities unless they were known to be two to whom such victim must be accept able Wherefore a separate temple was erected to Virtue and the work pushed forward with haste nevertheless these temples were not dedicated by him 46 LIVY At length he set out with a number of recruits to join the army which he had left the year before at Venusia Crispinus observing the great degree of fame which the taking of Tarentum had procured to Marcelhis prepared to lay siege to Locri in Bruttium sending to Sicily for engines and machines of all sorts and calling over a fleet from thence to attack that quarter of the city which stretched down to the sea But he laid aside his design of the siege because Hannibal had advanced to Licinium he heard too that his colleague had led out his army from Venusia which made him wish to unite their forces Crispinus therefore withdrew from Bruttium into Apulia and the two consuls sat down in separate camps distant from each other less than three miles between Venu sia and Bantia Hannibal also returned into the same country as soon as he had saved Locri from a siege And now the consuls being both impatient for action offered battle almost every day not doubting but that if the enemy would hazard an engagement with the two consular armies united they might effectually put an end to the war 26 As Hannibal of the two battles which he had fought with Marcellus the year before had gained one and lost the other he might now in case of an en gagement with the same antagonist find reasonable grounds both of hope and fear but he could by no means believe himself equal to a contest with the two consuls together Applying himself therefore wholly to his old artifices he watched an opportunity for an ambuscade However several skirmishes were fought between the camps with various success and the con suls began to think that the summer might be spun out in this manner They were of opinion however that the siege of Locri might nevertheless be prosecuted and they wrote to Lucius Cincius to come over with the fleet from Sicily to that place and to carry on the siege on the land side they ordered half the troops in garrison at Tarentum to march thither Hannibal having received previous intimation from some Thu HISTORV OF ROME BOOK XXVII 47 rians of these intended measures sent a party to lie in ambush on the road from Tarentum There under the hill of Petellia three thousand horsemen and two thousand foot were placed in concealment and the Romans marching carelessly without having examined the road fell into the snare where no less than two thousand soldiers were killed and about twelve hun dred taken prisoners the rest flying different ways through the fields and woods returned to Tarentum Between the Roman and Carthaginian camps stood a hill interspersed with trees which neither party at first had occupied because the Romans knew not the nature of the ground on the side which faced the camp of the enemy and Hannibal had judged it to be better fitted for an ambush than for a camp accordingly he sect thither for the purpose a strong detachment of Numidians whom he concealed in the middle of a thicket not one of whom stirred from his post in the day lest either their arms or themselves might be ob served from a distance There ran a general murmur through the Roman camp that this hill ought to be seized and secured by a fort lest if Hannibal should get possession of it they should have the enemy as it were over their heads The observation struck Mar cellus and he said to his colleague Why not go ourselves with a few horsemen and take a view of the place After examining the matter with our own eyes we shall be able to judge with more certainty Cris pinus assenting they proceeded to the spot attended by two hundred and twenty horsemen of whom forty were Fregellans the rest Etrurians they were ac companied by two military tribunes Marcus Mar cellus the consul s son and Aulus Manlius and by two prefects of the allies Lucius Arennius and Marcus Aulius Some writers have recorded that the consul Marcellus offered sacrifice on that day and that on the first victim being slain the liver was found without its head in the second all the usual parts appeared but there was a swelling observed on the head of the liver the aruspex also observing that in the second 48 LIVY case the entrails being imperfect and foul offered no very happy presages 27 But the consul Marcellus was possessed with such a passionate desire for a trial of strength with Hannibal that he never thought his own camp close enough to his and on this occasion as he was passing the rampart he left directions that every soldier should be ready in his place in order that if the hill which they were going to examine should be approved of the whole might strike their tents and follow them thither In front of the camp was a small plain and the road leading thence to the hill was open on all sides and exposed to view A watchman whom the Numidians had posted not in expectation of an oppor tunity so important as this but with the hope of cut ting off any party that might straggle too far in search of wood or forage gave them the signal to rise at once from their concealments Those who were to come forth from the summit and meet the enemy in front did not show themselves until the others who were to inclose them on the rear had got round Then all sprung forward from every side and raising a shout made a furious onset Though the consuls were so situated in the valley that they could neither force their way up the hill which was occupied by the enemy nor surrounded as they were effect a retreat the dispute might nevertheless have been protracted for a longer time bad not the Etrurians began to fly and thereby filled the rest with dismay However the Fregellans though abandoned by the Etrurians did not give up the contest as long as the consuls re mained unhurt who by their exhortations and their own personal exertions supported the spirit of the fight j but afterwards seeing both the consuls wounded and Marcellus pierced through with a lance and falling lifeless from his horse then the few betook themselves to flight carrying with them Crispinus who had re ceived two wounds from javelins and young Marcel lus who was also hurt One of the military tribunes Aulus Manlius was slain of the two prefects of the HISTORY OF ROME BOOK XXVII 49 allies Marcus Aulius was killed and Lucius Aren nius taken of the lictora of the consuls five fell alive into the enemy s hands of the rest some were slain the others fled with the consul Forty three horse men fell in the fight and pursuit and eighteen were made prisoners The troops in camp had taken the alarm and were going fo succor the consuls when they saw one consul and the other consul s son both wounded and the small remains of the unfortunate party on their return The death of Marcellus un happy in other respects was no less so in this that by conduct ill becoming either bis age for he was now above sixty years old or the prudence of a veteran commander he had so improvidently precipitated himself bis colleague and in some measure the whole commonwealth into such desperate hazard I should engage in too many and too long discussions on a single event if I were to recite all the various rela tions given by different writers of the death of Mar cellus To omit other authors Lucius Caslius pre sents us with three different narratives of that occur rence one received by tradition another written and contained in the funeral panegyric delivered by his son who was present in the action  and a third which he produces as the real state of the fact discovered by bis own inquiries But how much soever reports vary most of them notwithstanding concur in stating that he went out of his camp to view the ground and all that be was slain in an ambuscade 28 Hannibal supposing that the enemy must be greatly dismayed by the death of one of their consuls and the wounds of the other and wishing not to lose any advantage which a juncture so favorable might afford removed his camp immediately to the hill on which the battle had been fought Here he found the body of Marcellus and interred it Crispinus dis heartened by his colleague s death and his own wounds decamped in the silence of the following night and on the nearest mountains that he could reach pitched his camp in an elevated spot secure on all sides On liv vol v D 50 Ll VV this occasion the two commanders displayed great sagacity in their proceedings while one endeavored to effect the other to guard against deception Hanni bal had with Marcellns body gotten possession of his ring and Crispinus fearing lest mistakes occasioned by means of this signet might give room to the Car thaginian for practising some of his wiles sent ex presses round to all the neighboring states to inform them that  his colleague had been slain that the enemy was in possession of his ring and that they should therefore give no credit to any letters writlen in the name of Marcellns This message from the consul had but just arrived at Salapia when a letter was brought thither from Hannibal written in the name of Marcellns intimating that  he would come to Salapia on the night which was to follow that day and direct ing that the soldiers of the garrison should be ready in vase he should have occasion to employ them The Salapians were aware of the fraud and judging that Hannibal whom they had incensed not only by their defection from his party but by killing his horsemen was seeking an opportunity for revenge sent back his messenger who was a Roman deserter in order that the Soldiers might act as should be thought proper without being watched by him they then placed par ties of the townsmen on guard along the walls and in the convenient parts of the city forming the guards and watches for that night with more than ordinary care On each side of the gate through which they expected the enemy to come they placed the main strength of the garrison About the fourth watch Hannibal approached the city his vanguard was com posed of Roman deserters armed also in the Roman fashion These when they came to the gate as they all spoke the Latin language called up the watch men and ordered them to open the gate for the consul was at hand The watchmen as if awakened by their call were all in a hurry and bustle striving to open the gate which had been shut by letting down the port cullis some raised this with levers others pulled it HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXVII 61 with ropes to such a height that men might come in without stooping Scarcely was the passage suffi ciently opened when the deserters rushed in eagerly through the gate and when about six hundred had entered the rope by which it was kept suspended be ing loosened the portcullis fell down with a great noise Part of the Salapians now attacked the de serters who as if among friends carried their arms carelessly on their shoulders as on a march while the rest from the tower adjoining the gate and from the walls beat off the enemy with stones and pikes and javelins Thus Hannibal ensnared by an artifice wor thy of himself was obliged to retire and went thence to raise the siege of Locri which Cincius was pushing forward with the utmost vigor having constructed va rious works and being supplied with engines of every kind from Sicily Mago who almost despaired pf being able to hold out and maintain the defence of the city received the first gleam of returning hope from the news of Marcellus death This was soon followed by an ex press acquainting him that Hannibal having sent for ward the Numidian cavalry was hastening after at the head of the main body of infantry with all the speed he could make As soon therefore as he un derstood by signals made from the watch towers that the Numidians were drawing nigh he with his own forces suddenly throwing open a gate rushed out fu riously on the besiegers The suddenness of his attack rather than inequality of strength at first made the dispute doubtful but afterwards when the Numi dians came up the Romans were struck with such dis may that they fled in confusion towards the sea and their ships leaving behind their works and machines which they used in battering the walls In this man ner did the approach of Hannibal raise the siege of Locri 29 When Crispinus learned that Hannibal had gone into Bruttium he ordered Marcus Marcellus military tribune to lead away to Venusia the army which had beeo under the command of his colleague and he 52 LIVY himself with his own legions set out for Capua being scarcely able to endure the motion of a litter his wounds were so very painful But he first despatched a letter to Rome with an account of Marcellus death and of his own dangerous situation It was not in his power he said to go to Rome to attend the elec tions because he was sure he should not be able to hear the fatigue of the journey and besides that he was uneasy about Tarentum lest Hannibal might march thither from Bruttium It was therefore necessary that some persons should be commissioned to come to him in his quarters men of prudence to whom he could with freedom speak his thoughts on the present state of affairs The reading of this letter caused great sorrow for the death of one consul and apprehensions for the safety of the other The senate therefore sent Quintus Fabius the younger to Venusia to take the command of the army there and deputed three per sons to wait on the consul Sextus Julius Caesar Lu cius Licinius Pollio and Lucius Cincius Alimentus who had a few days before come home from Sicily These were ordered to deliver a message to the con sul that if he could not come himself to Rome to hold the elections he would within the Roman territories nominate a dictator for that purpose and directions were given that in case the consul should have gone to Tarentum then Quintus Claudius the pretor should lead the army from its present quarters into that part of the country where he could afford protection to the greatest number of the cities of the allies In the course of this summer Marcus Valerius passed from Sicily to Africa with a fleet of one hundred sail and making a descent near the city of Clupea ravaged the country to a great extent meeting scarcely any one in arms After which the troops employed in these de predations made a hasty retreat to their ships in con sequence of a sudden report that the Carthaginian fleet was approaching This fleet consisted of eighty three ships with which the Roman commander came to an engagement not far from Clupea and gained a com HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXVII 53 plete victory After taking eighteen ships and dis persing the rest he returned to Lilybaeum with abun dance of booty acquired both on land and sea 30 Philip during this summer brought assistance to the Achieans in compliance with their earnest jn treaties for on one side Machanidas tyrant of the Lacedasmonians harassed them continually by irrup tions from his territories which lay contiguous to theirs and on another the jEtolians transporting an army in ships through the strait which runs between Naupactus and Patrae called by the neighboring inha bitants Rhios had spread devastations through the country A report also prevailed that Attalus king of Asia intended to come over into Europe because the jEtolians in their last general council had consti tuted him chief magistrate of their state While Phi lip was for all these reasons marching down into Greece he was met at the city of Lamia by the JEto lians under the command of Pyrrhias who had been created pretor for that year conjointly with Attalus on account of the latter s absence Besides their own forces they had a body of auxiliaries sent by Attalus and about one thousand men from the Roman fleet of Publius Sulpicius Against this commander and these forces Philip fought twice with success and in each battle slew at least one thousand The jEtolians be ing so greatly dismayed as to keep themselves close under the walls of Lamia Philip led back his army to Pbalara This place being situated on the Malian bay was formerly thickly inhabited on account of its excellent harbor the safe anchorage on either side with other commodious circumstances to which both the sea and the land contributed Hither came am bassadors from Ptolemy king of Egypt the RhodianS Athenians and Chians with intent to compose the dif ferences between Philip and the jEtolians The jEto lians also invited a mediator from among their neigh bors Amynander king of Athamania But the con cern of all was engaged not so much by their regard for the Etolians who were remarkable for an arro LIVY gance unbecoming a Grecian state as by their wishes to prevent Philip from interfering in any of the affairs of Greece an interference which would be highly dangerous to the general liberty The deliberations concerning a pacification were adjourned to the meet ing of the council of the Achaeans and a certain time and place were fixed for that assembly In the mean time a truce for thirty days was obtained The king proceeding thence through Thessaly and Boeotia came to Chalcis in Euboea with design to exclude Attalus from the harbors and coasts for intelligence had been received that he intended to come to Euboea with a fleet Afterwards leaving there a body of troops to oppose Attalus in case he should happen to arrive in the mean time and setting out himself with a few horsemen and light infantry he came to Argos Here the superintendence of the games of Haerean Juno and Nemasan Hercules being conferred on him by the suf frages of the people because the kings of the Macedo nians affect to derive the origin of their family from that city he performed those in honor of Juno and as soon as they were finished went off instantly to jEgium to the council summoned some time before In this assembly several schemes were proposed for putting an end to the iEtolian war that neither the Romans nor Attalus might have any pretence for en tering Greece But every measure of the kind was defeated at once by the jEtolians when the time of the truce had scarcely expired on their hearing that Attalus was arrived at iEgina and that the Roman fleet lay at Naupactus for being called into the coun cil of the Achasans where were likewise present the same ambassadors who had treated of a pacification at Phalara they at first complained of some trifling acts committed during the truce contrary to the faith of the convention at last declaring that the war could not be terminated on any other terms than by the Achaeans giving back Pylus to the Messenians Atin tania to the Romans and Ardyasa to Scerdilaedus and Pleuratus Philip conceiving the utmost indignation HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXVII 55 at the vanquished party presuming to prescribe terms to their conqueror said that in listening before to proposals of peace or in agreeing to a truce he had not been led by any expectation that the jEtolians would remain quiet but by his wish to have all the confederates witnesses that the object of his pursuits was peace of theirs war Thus without any thing being effected towards an accommodation he dismissed the assembly left five thousand soldiers to protect the Achasans receiving from them five ships of war with which added to a fleet lately sent to him from Car thage and some vessels then on their way from Bithy nia sent by king Prusias he had resolved if he could effect the junction to try his strength in a naval en gagement with the Romans who had long been masters of the sea in that part of the world After dissolving the council he went back to Argos because the time of the Nemaian games was approaching and he wished to give them by his presence an additional degree of splendor 31 While the king was employed in the celebration of the games and during that season of festivity in dulging his mind in relaxation from military opera tions Publius Sulpicius setting sail from Naupactus arrived on the coast between Sicyon and Corinth making violent depredations on that fine and fertile country The news of this event called away Philip from the exhibition He marched off with rapidity at the head of his cavalry leaving orders for the infantry to follow and while the Romans were straggling at random and heavily laden with booty not apprehend ing any danger of the kind he attacked and drove them to their ships Thus the Roman fleet returned to Naupactus with little cause of triumph for the booty which they had taken On the other side Philip by the fame of a victory whatever might be its real im portance gained however over Romans added greatly to the lustre of the remaining part of the games and the festival was celebrated with extraordinary re joicings to which he contributed also by his popular 56 LIVY behavior for laying aside his diadem purple robe and other royal apparel he set himself with respect to appearance on a level with the rest than which no thing can be more grateful to the people of free states This conduct would have afforded very strong hopes of general liberty had he not debased and dishonored all by intolerable debauchery for night and day with one or two attendants he ranged through the houses of married people He had lowered his dignity to the common level consequently the less conspicuous he appeared the less restraint he was under and thus the liberty of which he had given others an empty pros pect he stretched to the utmost in the gratification of his own unlawful desires Money and seductive dis courses were not always sufficient for his purposes he even employed violence in aid of them and dangerous was it for husbands and parents to show inflexible strictness in obstructing the brutal passions of the king He took from Aratus a man of distinction among the Achaeans his wife named Polycratia and deluding her with the hope of being married to a so vereign prince carried her into Macedonia After spending the time of the celebration of the games and several days after they were finished in this scanda lous manner he marched to Dymae with design to dislodge a garrison of the jEtolians who had been invited by the Eleans and received into that city At Dyma he was joined by the Achssans under Cy cliades their chief magistrate who were inflamed with hatred against the Eleans because they refused to unite with the other states of Achaia and highly incensed against the jEtolians whom they believed to be the authors of the war carried on against them by the Romans Leaving Dymas and uniting their forces they passed the river Larissus which separates the territory of Elis from that of Dymes 32 The first day on which they entered the enemy s borders they spent in plundering On the next they advanced to the city in order of battle having sent forward the cavalry to ride up to the gates and pro HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXVII 57 voke the jEtolians who were ever well inclined to embrace an opportunity of sallying out from their works They did not know that Sulpicius with fifteen ships had come over from Naupactus to Cyllene and landing four thousand soldiers had in the dead of night lest his march should be observed thrown him self into Elis When therefore they perceived among the yEtolians and Eleans the Roman standards and arms an appearance so unexpected filled them with the greatest terror At first the king had a mind to order a retreat but the jEtolians being already en gaged with the Trallians a tribe of Illyrians so called and his party appearing to have the worst of the con test he himself at the head of his cavalry made a charge on a Roman cohort Here the horse of Philip being pierced through with a spear threw him forward over his head to the ground which gave rise to a fu rious conflict between the contending parties the Ro mans pressing hard on the king and his own men pro tecting him His own behavior on the occasion was remarkably brave although he was obliged to fight on foot among squadrons of cavalry In a short time the dispute becoming unequal great numbers being killed and wounded near him he was forced away by his soldiers and mounting another horse fled from the field He pitched his camp that day at the distance of five miles from the city of Elis and on the next led all his forces to a fort called Pyrgus where as he had heard a multitude of the country people with their cattle had run together through fear of being plun dered This irregular and unarmed crowd were so utterly dismayed at his approach that he at once made himself master of the whole and by this seizure gained compensation for whatever disgrace he had sustained at Elis While he was distributing the spoil and pri soners the latter amounting to four thousand men and the cattle of all kinds to twenty thousand news arrived from Macedonia that a person called Eropus had by bribing the commander of the garrison and citadel gained possession of Lychnidus that he had 58 LIVY also got into his hands some towns of the Dassare tians and was besides endeavoring to persuade the Dardanians to take arms In consequence of this in telligence dropping the prosecution of the war be tween the Achaeans and iEtolians but leaving how ever two thousand five hundred soldiers of one sort or other under the command of Menippus and Polyphan tas to assist his allies he marched away from Dymae through Achaia Boeotia and Euboea and on the tenth day arrived at Demetrias in Thessaly Here he was met by other couriers with accounts of still more dan gerous commotions that the Dardanians pouring into Macedonia had already seized on Orestis and marched down into the plain of Argestee and that a report pre vailed among the barbarians that Philip had been slain This rumor was occasioned by the following circumstance â In his expedition against the plunder ing parties near Sicyon being carried by the impetu osity of his horse against a tree a projecting branch broke off one of the side ornaments of his helmet which being found by an iEtolian and carried into jEtolia to Scerdilaedus who knew it to be the cogni sance of the king it was supposed that he was killed After Philip s departure from Achaia Sulpicius sail ing to jEgina joined his fleet to that of Attalus The Achasans gained the victory in a battle with the JEto lians and Eleans fought near Messene King Attalus and Publius Sulpicius wintered at jEgina 33 Towards the close of this year the consul Titus Quinttus Crispinus after having nominated Titus JVIan lius Torquatus dictator to preside at the elections and solemnise the games died of his wounds according to some writers atTarentum according to others in Cam pania Thus was there a concurrence of events such as had never been experienced in any former war while the two consuls being slain without having fought any memorable battle left the commonwealth as it were fatherless The dictator Manlius appointed Cains Servilius then curule edile his master of the horse The senate on the first day of its meeting HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXVII 59 ordered the dictator to celebrate the great games which Marcus jEmilius city pretor had exhibited in the con sulate of Caius Flaminius and Cneius Servilius and had vowed to be repeated at the end of five years Accordingly he not only performed them now but vowed them for the next lustrum But as the two consular armies without commanders were so near the enemy both the senate and people laying aside all other concerns made it their chief and only care to have consuls elected as soon as possible and especially that they should be men whose courage was so tem pered by prudence as to guard them sufficiently against Carthaginian wiles for it was considered that as through the whole course of the present war the too warm and precipitate tempers of their generals had been productive of great losses so in that very year the consuls through excessive eagerness to engage the enemy had fallen unguardedly into their snares that the gods however compassionating the Roman nation had spared the troops who were guiltless of the fault and had decreed that the penalty incurred by the rash ness of the commanders should fall on their own heads When the senate looked round for proper persons to be appointed to the consulship Caius Claudius Nero at once met their view as eminently qualified beyond all others They then sought a colleague for him They well knew him to be a man of extraordinary abilities but at the same time of a temper more san guine and enterprising than was expedient in the pre sent exigences of the war or against such an opponent as Hannibal and therefore they thought it necessary to qualify his disposition by joining with him a man of moderation and prudence 34 Many years before this Marcus Livius on the expiration of his consulship had been judged guilty of misconduct by a sentence of the people and he was so deeply affected by this disgrace that he retired into the country and for a long time avoided not only the city but all intercourse with mankind About eight years afterwards Marcus Claudius Marcellus and Mar 60 LtVY cus Valerius Laevinus then consuls brought him back into Rome but still he appeared in a squalid dress and suffered his hair and beard to grow displaying in his countenance and garb a more than ordinary sensi bility of the censure passed on him When Lucius Veturius and Publius Licinius were censors they compelled him to be shaved to lay aside his sordid apparel to attend the meetings of the senate and per form other public duties But after all this he used to give his vote either by a single word or by going to the side of the house which he approved until a trial came on in the cause of Marcus Livius Macatus a man to whom he was related and whose character was at stake and this obliged him to deliver his sentiments at large in the senate The speech which he made after so long an interval of silence drew on him all eyes and became the subject of much conversation it was asserted that  the people had treated him with great injustice and that the consequences of this unde served ill treatment had been highly injurious to that very people as during a war of such importance and danger the state had been deprived both of the ser vices and counsels of so great a man With Caius Nero neither Quintus Fabius nor Marcus Valerius Laevinus could be joined in office because the law did not allow the election of two patricians The same objection lay against Titus Manlius besides that he had before refused the offer of the consulship and would again refuse it But if the election of Marcus Livius in conjunction with Caius Nero could be ef fected then they would have such consuls as could scarcely be equalled Nor were the commons disin clined to the proposal although it took its rise from the patricians One only person in the state the per son to whom the honor was offered objected to the measure charging the people with levity and incon stancy he said that when he appeared before them in the situation of a defendant in a mourning habit they refused him their compassion yet now they forced on him the white gown against his will heaping HISTORY OF ROME BOOK XXVII 61 punishments and honors on the same object If they deemed him an honest man why had they condemned him as wicked and guilty If they had discovered proofs of his guilt after seeing such reason to repent of having trusted him with the consulship once why intrust him with it a second time V While he uttered these and such like reproaches and complaints he was checked by the senators who bade him recollect that Camillus though exiled by his country yet re turned at its call and re established it when shaken from the very foundations that it was the duty of a man to mollify by patience and to bear with resigna tion the severity of his country like that of a parent By the united exertions of all Marcus Livius was elected consul with Caius Claudius Nero 35 Three days after the election of pretors was held and there were chosen into that office Lucius Porcius Licinus Caius Mamilius Aulus and Caius Hostilius Cato As soon as the elections were con cluded and the games celebrated the dictator and master of the horse resigned their offices Caius Te rentius Varro was sent as propretor into Etruria in order that Caius Hostilius might go from that province of Tarentum to take the command of the army which had acted under the late consul Titus Quintius and that Titus Manlius might go beyond sea in the character of ambassador to observe what business was going on abroad and also as during that sum mer the Olympic games were to be exhibited which were also attended by the greatest concourse of the people of Greece that he might go to that assembly if not prevented by the enemy and inform any Sici lians whom he should find driven there and any citi zens of Tarentum banished by Hannibal that they might return to their homes and might be assured that the Roman people meant to restore to them the whole of the property which they possessed before the war began As the approaching year seemed to threaten the greatest dangers and there were as yet no magistrates for the administration of public affairs 62 LIVY all men directed their attention to he consuls elect and wished them as speedily as possible to cast lots for their provinces that each of them might know be forehand what province and what antagonist he was to have Measures were also taken in the senate on a motion made by Quintus Fabius Maximus to recon cile them to each other for there subsisted between them an avowed enmity which on the side of Livms was the more inveterate as during his misfortunes he had felt himself treated with contempt by the other He was therefore the more obstinately implacable and insisted that  there was no need of any reconcilia tion for they would conduct all business with the greater diligence and activity while each should be afraid lest a colleague who was his enemy might find means of exalting his own character at the other s expense Nevertheless the influence of the senate prevailed on them to lay aside their animosity and to act with harmony and unanimity in the administra tion of the government The provinces allotted to them were not as in former years a joint command in the same districts but quite separate in the remotest extremities of Italy to one Bruttium and Lucania where he was to act against Hannibal to the other Gaul where he was to oppose Hasdrubal who was now said to be approachingto the Alps It was ordered that the consul to whose lot Gaul fell should of the two armies one of which was in Gaul and the other in Etruria choose whichever he thought proper and join to it the city legions and that he to whom the pro vince of Bruttium fell should after enlisting new le gions for the city take his choice of the armies com manded by the consuls of the preceding year and that the army left by the consul should be given to Quintus Fulvius proconsul and that he should con tinue in command for the year To Cains Hostilius to whom they had assigned the province of Tarentum in exchange for Etruria they now gave Capua instead One legion was ordered for him â that which Fulvius had commanded the year before HISTORY OF ROME BOOK XXVII 63 36 The public anxiety respecting Hasdrnbal s march into Italy increased daily At first envoys from the Massilians brought information that he had passed into Gaul and that the inhabitants of that country were in high spirits on the occasion because it was reported that he had brought a vast quantity of gold for the purpose of hiring auxiliaries In company with these envoys on their return were sent from Rome Sextus Antistius and Marcus Retius to inquire into the matter who brought back an account that they had sent persons with Massilian guides who by means of some Gallic chieftains connected in friend ship with the Massilians might procure exact intel ligence of every particular and that they had dis covered with certainty that Hasdrubal having already collected a very numerous army intended to pass the Alps in the following spring and that nothing prevented his doing it immediately but the passes of those mountains being shut up by the winter Publius jElius Pastus was elected and inaugurated into the office of augur in the room of Marcus Marcellus and Cneius Cornelius Dolabella into that of king in reli gious matters in the room of Marcus Marcius who had died two years before In this year the first time since Hannibal s coming into Italy the lustrum was closed by the censors Publius Sempronius Tudi tanus and Marcus Cornelius Cethegus The number of citizens rated was one hundred and thirty seven thousand one hundred and eight a number much smaller than it had been before the war It is re corded that in this same year the comitium was co vered and the Roman games once repeated by the curule ediles Quintus Metellus and Caius Servilius and the plebeian games twice by the plebeian ediles Quintus Mamilius and Marcus Caecilius Metellus These also erected three statues in the temple of Ceres and there was a feast of Jupiter on occasion of the games A U C 645 B C 207 Then entered on the consulship Cains Claudius Nero and Marcus Livius 64 LIVY a second time and as they had already when consuls elect cast lots for their provinces they now ordered the pretors to do the same To Caius Hostilius fell the city jurisdiction to which the foreign was added in order that three pretors might go abroad to the pro vinces To Aulus Hostilius fell Sardinia to Caius Mamilius Sicily and to Lucius Porcius Gaul The whole of the legions amounting to twenty three were distributed in such manner that each of the consuls should have two Spain four the three pretors in Sicily Sardinia and Gaul two each Caius Teren tius in Etruria two Quintus Fulvius in liruttium two Quintus Claudius about Tarentum and Sallen tum two Caius Hostilius Tubulus at Capua one and two were ordered to be raised for the city For the first four legions the people elected tribunes for the rest they were appointed by the consuls 37 Before the consuls left home the nine days solemnity was performed on account of a shower of stones having fallen from the sky at Veii The men tion of one prodigy was as usual followed by reports of others that the temple of Jupiter at Miuturnae a grove at Marica a wall and a gate of Atella had been struck by lightning The people of Minturntc said what was still more terrifying that a stream of blood had flowed in at one of their gates at Capua too a wolf came into one of the gates and tore the sentinel These prodigies were expiated with victims of the greater kinds and a supplication of one day s con tinuance was ordered by the pontiffs The nine days solemnity was afterwards performed a second time on account of a shower of stones seen to fall during the armilustrum The people s minds were no sooner freed from religious apprehensions than they were again disturbed by an account that at Frusino an in fant was born of a size equal to that of a child four years old and wonderful not only for its bulk but for its sex being doubtful as had been the case of the one born two years before at Sinuessa Aruspices HISTORY OF ROME BOOK XXVII 65 sent from Etruria denounced this to be a portent par ticularly horrid that ought to be exterminated from the Roman territories and without being suffered to touch the earth drowned in the sea Accordingly they shut it up alive in a chest and threw it into the deep The pontiffs likewise issued a mandate that thrice nine virgins should go in procession through the city singing a hymn While they were employed in the temple of Jupiter Stator learning this hymn which was composed by the poet Livius the temple of Imperial Juno on the Aventine was struck by lightning The aruspices having delivered their judg ment that this prodigy had respect to the matrons and that the goddess ought to be appeased by an offering the curule ediles by an edict summoned together into the capitol all those matrons who had houses in the eity of Rome or within ten miles of it and from this number they chose twenty five to whom they paid in a contribution out of their own effects With this mo ney a golden basin was made and carried to the Aven tine where the matrons with every demonstration of purity and sanctity immolated to the goddess Im mediately after the decemvirs by proclamation ap pointed a day for another sacrifice to the same divi nity which was conducted in the following order â from the temple of Apollo two white heifers were led into the city through the Carmental gate after them were carried two cypress images of imperial Juno then followed the twenty seven virgins clad in long robes singing the hymn in honor of that deity This hymn might perhaps to the uninformed judgments of those times appear to have merit but if repeated at present it would seem barbarous and uncouth The train of virgins was followed by the decemvirs crowned with laurel and dressed in purple bordered robes From the gate they proceeded through the Ju garian street into the forum here the procession halted and a cord was given to the virgins of which tbey all took hold and then advanced beating time with their feet to the music of their voices Thus they LIV VOL V E 66 LIVY proceeded through the Tuscan street the Velabrum the cattle market and up the Publician hill until they arrived at the temple of Imperial Juno There two victims were offered in sacrifice by the decemvirs and the cypress images were placed in the temple 38 After due expiations were offered to the gods the consuls began to enlist soldiers and this business they enforced with more strictness and severity than had been formerly practised within the memory of any then living for the new enemy advancing towards Italy made the war doubly formidable As the num ber of young men capable of serving was considerably diminished they resolved to compel even the maritime colonies to furnish soldiers although they were said to enjoy under a solemn grant an immunity from service At first they refused compliance on which the con suls published orders that each state should on a cer tain day produce before the senate the title on which it claimed such exemption On the day appointed the following states appeared before the senate  Ostia Al sia Antium Auxur Minturnae Sinuessa and from the coast of the upper sea Sena These recited their several claims but none of them were allowed except those of Antium and Ostia and even in these two co lonies the young men were obliged to swear that while the enemy remained in Italy they would not lodge out of the walls of their colonies longer than thirty days Although it was the opinion of all that the consuls ought to open the campaign as early as possible as it would be necessary to oppose Hasdrubal immediately on his descent from the Alps lest he might seduce the Cisalpine Gauls and Etruria which latter already en tertained sanguine hopes of effecting a revolt also that it would be necessary to give Hannibal full employ ment in his ovvn quarters lest he might extricate him self from Bruttium and advance to meet his brother yet Livius delayed not being satisfied with the forces destined for his provinces while his colleague had a choice of two excellent consular armies and a third which Quintus Claudius commanded at Tarentum he HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXVII 67 therefore introduced a proposal of recalling the volun teer slaves to the standards The senate gave the con suls unlimited power to fill up their companies with any men whom they approved to choose out of all the armies such as they liked and to exchange them and remove them from one province to another as they should judge best for the public service In the ma nagement of all these matters the greatest harmony prevailed between the consuls and the volunteer slaves were inrolled in the nineteenth and twentieth legions Some writers say that on this occasion power ful reinforcements were also sent from Spain by Pub lius Scipio to Marcus Livius eight thousand Spaniards and Gauls two thousand legionary soldiers and a body of cavalry composed of Numidians and Spaniards in number one thousand eight hundred that Marcus Lu cretius brought these forces by sea and that Caius Ma milius sent from Sicily four thousand archers and slingers 39 The disquietude at Rome was increased by a letter brought out of Gaul from the pretor Lucius Por cius the contents of which were that  Hasdrubal had moved out of winter quarters and was now on his pas sage over the Alps that eight thousand of the Ligu rians were embodied and armed and would join him as soon as he arrived in Italy unless an army were sent into Liguria to attack them beforehand as to himself he would advance as far as he should think it safe with his small force This letter obliged the con suls to finish the levies with haste and to set out for their respective provinces earlier than they had in tended for their purpose was that each should keep his antagonist employed in his own province so as not to suffer the two to combine their forces into one body An opinion formed by Hannibal helped to farther their design for though he believed that his brother would make good his way into Italy during the course of that summer yet when he reflected on the difficulties with which he had himself struggled first in the passage of the Rhone then in that of the Alps fighting against 68 LIVY men and against the nature of the places for five suc cessive months he had not the least expectation that the other would be able to effect his purpose with so much more ease and expedition and for this reason he was the later in quitting his winter quarters But Hasdrubal found every thing to proceed more easily and expeditiously than either himself or others had even ventured to hope for the Arvernians and after wards the other Gallic and Alpine tribes not only gave him a friendly reception but even accompanied him to the war Then in most parts of the country through which he marched roads had been made by his brother in places until then impassable besides which as the Alps had for twelve years been a con stant route for divers people he found the disposition of the inhabitants much improved for in former times being never visited by foreigners or accustomed to see a stranger in their country they were unsociable to wards all the human race Being ignorant at first of the destination of the Carthaginian they had imagined that his object was their rocks and forts and to make prey of their men and cattle but the accounts which they heard of the Punic war and by which Italy had so long been harassed by this time fully convinced them that the Alps were only used as a passage and that two overgrown states separated by vast tracks of sea and land were contending for power and empire These causes opened the Alps to Hasdrubal But whatever advantage he gained from the celerity of his march he lost it all by delaying at Placentia where he carried on a fruitless blockade rather than an at tack He had supposed that the reduction of a town standing in a plain would be easily accomplished  and being a colony of great note he was persuaded that by destroying this city he should fill the rest with terror That siege however not only impeded his own progress but also stopped Hannibal when he was just setting out from his winter quarters in conse quence of hearing that his brother had reached Italy so much more quickly than he had expected for he HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXVII 69 considered not only how tedious the siege of a city is but also how ineffectually he himself going back vic torious from the Trebia had attempted that same colony 40 The consuls taking different routes when setting out to open the campaign drew the anxiety of the pub lic in opposite directions as if to two distinct wars at once for besides their recollection of the heavy cala mities which Hannibal s first coming had brought on Italy people were farther distressed by doubts of the issue What gods said they to themselves  would be so propitious to the city and to the empire as to grant success to their arms in both quarters at the same time Hitherto the business had been protracted by a counterpoise of successes and misfortunes When in Italy at the Thrasymenus and Cannae the Roman power had been crushed to the earth a number of successful efforts in Spain had raised it up from its fallen state when afterwards in Spain a succession of defeats in which two excellent commanders were lost had in a great measure ruined the two armies the many ad vantages gained by the Roman arms in Italy and Si cily had afforded shelter to the shattered vessel of the state Besides even the distance of place one war being then carried on in the remotest extremity of the world allowed room to breathe but now two wars had penetrated into the very heart of Italy two com manders of the most distinguished reputation stood on the opposite sides of the city of Rome and the whole mass of danger the intire burden pressed on one spot Whichever of these commanders should first gain a battle he would in a few days after join his camp with the other The preceding year also having been saddened by the deaths of the two consuls served to augment the general apprehensions Such were the melancholy forebodings which perplexed the minds of the people as they escorted the commanders on their departure to their provinces Historians have mentioned that Marcus Livius when setting out for the campaign being still full of resentment against his  70 LIVY countrymen and warned by Quintus Fabius not to come to a battle hastily or before he was well ac quainted with the kind of enemy whom he had to en counter answered that the first moment that he should get a sight of that enemy he would fight him being asked the reason of such eagerness he replied I will acquire either extraordinary glory from the de feat of the foe or joy from that of my countrymen and though the latter might not perhaps redound to my honor yet it is certainly what they have deserved at my hands Before the consul Claudius arrived in his province as Hannibal was leading his army to wards Sallentum through the very borders of the Larinatian frontiers Cains Hostilius Tubulus with some lightly accoutred cohorts attacked him and caused dreadful confusion among his unmarshalled troops killing four thousand men and taking nine military standards Quintus Claudius who had his forces cantoned through the towns in the territory of Sallentum on being apprised of the enemy s motions marched out of his winter quarters wherefore Han nibal lest he should be obliged to encounter the two armies at once decamped in the night and withdrew from the Tarentine territory into Bruttium Claudius fell back to the country adjoining Sallentum Hostilius on his march towards Capua met the consul Claudius at Venusia and here were selected out of both armies forty thousand foot and two thousand five hundred horse with which the consul was to act against Han nibal The rest of the forces Hostilius was ordered to lead to Capua that he might deliver them up to Quintus Fulvius proconsul 41 Hannibal having drawn together his forces from all quarters both those which he had hitherto kept in winter quarters and those which were in garrison in the Bruttian territory came into Luca nia to Grumentum in hope of regaining the towns which through fear had joined the Romans To the same place came the Roman consul from Venusia carefully examining the roads as he went and pitched HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXVII 71 his camp at the distance of about fifteen hundred paces from the enemy From hence the rampart of the Car thaginians seemed to be almost close to the wall of Grumentum the actual distance however was five hundred paces Between the Carthaginian and Ro man camps the ground was level and on the left hand side of the Carthaginians and right of the Ro mans stood some naked hills from which neither party apprehended any mischief because there were no woods nor any covering for an ambuscade Par ties sallying from the advanced posts fought several skirmishes of little consequence It appeared plainly that the Roman general had no other object in view than to hinder the enemy from quitting the place while Hannibal wishing to get away frequently drew out bis whole strength and offered battle On this occasion the consul adopted the crafty genius of his adversary and as there could be little apprehension of a surprise the hills being open and having been examined by his scouts he ordered five cohorts with five additional companies to pass over their summit in the night and conceal themselves in the valleys on the other side The time when they were to rise from their ambush he settled with Tiberius Claudius Asel lus military tribune and Publius Claudius prefect of the allies whom he sent at their head He him self at the dawn of day drew out all his forces both foot and horse into the field In a short time after Hannibal also on his side displayed the signal for battle and a great noise ensued in his camp while the men ran hastily to arms Then all both horse and foot rushed eagerly out of the gates and scattering themselves over the plain advanced hastily to attack the enemy The consul observing them in this dis order commanded Caius Aurunculeius tribune of the third legion to make his cavalry charge them with all possible fury remarking that  they had spread them selves like cattle over the plain and in such confusion that before they could be formed they might be ridden down and trodden under foot 72 LIVY 42 Hannibal bad not yet come out of bis camp when he heard the shouts of the troops engaged alarmed at this he led his forces with all speed to wards the enemy The charge of the Roman cavalry had already distressed his van and of their infantry the first legion and the right wing were coming into action while the Carthaginians without any regular order began the fight just as chance threw each in the way of either horseman or footman The combatants on both sides were sustained by reinforcements and Hanni bal in the midst of the terror and tumult would have formed his line while fighting which is no easy matter unless to a veteran commander and in the case of ve teran troops but that the shout of the cohorts and companies running down from the hills and which was heard on their rear struck them with the fear of being cut off from their camp and had it not been near seized as they were with a panic and flying in every part very great numbers would have been slain for the cavalry stuck close to their rear and the cohorts running down the declivity of the hills over clear and level ground assailed them in flank However upwards of eight thousand men were killed more than seven hundred men made prisoners and nine military standards were taken Even of the ele phants which in such a sudden and irregular action had been of no use four were killed and two taken Of the Romans and their allies there fell about five hundred Next day the Carthaginian kept himself quiet The Roman brought his army into the field and when he saw that none came out to meet him he ordered the spoils of the slain to be collected and the bodies of his own men to be brought together and buried After this for several successive days he pushed up so close to the enemy s gates that he seemed to intend an assault but at length Hannibal decamped at the third watch of the night and made towards Apulia leaving a great number of fires and tents on the side of the camp which faced the enemy and a few Numidians who were to show themselves HISTORY OF ROME BOOK XXVII 73 on the ramparts and at the gates As soon as day ap peared the Roman army came up to the trenches the Numidians as directed showing themselves for some time on the ramparts having imposed on the enemy as Jong as possible they rode off at full speed until they overtook the body of their armyÂ The consul perceiving the camp perfectly silent and no longer seeing any where even the small number who had pa raded in view at the dawn of day despatched two horsemen to examine the state of the works and when he learned with certainty that all was safe he ordered his army to march in Here he delayed no longer than while his men collected the plunder then sounding a retreat long before night he brought back his forces into their tents Next day at the first light he set out and following by long marches the tracks of the Carthaginians by such intelligence as he could procure overtook them not far from Venusia Here likewise an irregular kind of battle was fought in which above two thousand of the fugitives fell From thence Hannibal marching in the night and taking his way through mountains that he might not be forced to an engagement proceeded towards Meta pontum from which place Hanno who commanded the garrison of the town was sent with a small party into Bruttium to raise fresh forces while Hannibal with the addition of the garrison to his own troops went back to Venusia by the same roads through which he had come and thence to Canusium Nero had never quitted the enemy s steps and when he was going himself to Metapontum had sent orders to Quintus Fnlvius to come into Lucania lest that coun try should be left without defence 43 In the mean time Hasdrubal having raised the siege of Placentia sent four Gallic horsemen and two Numidians with a letter for Hannibal these after traversing almost the whole length of Italy through the midst of enemies in order to follow him on his retreat to Metapontum mistook the road and went to wards Tarentum where they were seized by some  74 LIVY Roman foragers roving through the country and con ducted to the propretor Quintus Claudius At first they eluded his inquiries by evasive answers but on being threatened with torture fear compelled them to own the truth and they confessed that they were charged with a letter to Hannibal With this letter sealed as it was the prisoners were given in charge to Lucius Virginius military tribune to be conducted to the consul Claudius and two troops of Samnite horse were sent to escort them Claudius caused the letter to be read to him by an interpreter and having ex amined the prisoners he concluded that the present conjuncture of affairs was not of such a nature as to require that the consuls should carry on the war ac cording to regular plans each within the limits of his own province by means of his own troops and against an antagonist pointed out by the senate but that some extraordinary and daring stroke should be struck such as could not be foreseen or thought of which at its commencement might cause no less dread among their countrymen than among the enemy but when accom plished would convert their great fears into as great exultation Wherefore sending Hasdrubal s letter to Rome to the senate he at the same time acquainted the conscript fathers with his intentions advising that as Hasdrubal had written to his brother that he would meet him in Umbria they should immediately call home the legion then at Capua raise new levies and post the city army at Narnia to intercept the enemy Such were the contents of his letter to the senate for himself he sent on messengers through the districts of Larina Marrucia Frentana and Pra tntia along the road which he intended to take with his army giving directions that all the inhabitants should bring down from their towns and farms victuals ready dressed for the soldiers and that they should furnish horses and other beasts of burden so that the weary might be accommodated with easy transports He then selected from the Romans and allies the flower of their armies consisting of six thousand foot and one HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXVII 75 thousand horse and giving out that be meant to seize on the nearest town in Lucania and the Carthaginian garrison therein he ordered them all to be ready for a remove Having set out in the night he turned off towards Picenum and making the longest possible marches proceeded directly towards his colleague having left the command of the camp to Quintus Ca tius lieutenant general 44 At Rome there was no less fright and consterna tion than had been felt two years before when the Carthaginian camp was brought close to the walls and gates of the city nor could people well determine whether they should commend or blame the consul for his boldness in undertakingsuch an adventurous march It was evident that his reputation would depend on the issue though there is not perhaps a more unfair me thod of judging People considered with alarming apprehensions that  the camp in the neighborhood of such a foe as Hannibal had been left without a gene ral and under the guard of an army the strength of which bad been carried away that the consul pre tending an expedition into Lucania when in fact he was going to Picenum and Gaul had left his camp destitute of any other means of safety than merely the enemy s want of information as to the general and a part of his army having quitted it What would be the consequence if this should be discovered and if Hannibal should resolve either with his whole army to pursue Nero whose intire force was but six thou sand men or to assault the camp which was left as a prey without strength without command without aus pices V The past disasters of this war and the deaths of the two consuls in the last year served also to in crease these terrible fears Besides they reflected that all those misfortunes had happened while there was but one general and one army of the enemy in Italy whereas at present there were two Punic wars there two numerous armies and in a manner two Haunibals for Hasdrubal was a son of the same fa ther Hamilcar was a commander equally enterprising 76 LIVY trained to making war against the Romans during many campaigns in Spain and rendered famous by a double victory over them by the destruction of two of their armies and two of their ablest commanders With respect to the speedy accomplishment of his march from Spain and his address in rousing the Gallic clans to arms he had much more reason to boast than Han nibal himself because he had collected a body of auxiliaries in those very places where the other had lost the greater part of his soldiers by hunger and cold the two most miserable ways in which men can perish To all this people acquainted with the transactions in Spain added that in Nero he would meet an anta gonist with whom he was not unacquainted one whom formerly when caught accidentally in a dangerous de file he had baffled just as he would a child by falla cious terms of peace Seeing every thing through the medium of fear which always represents objects in the worst light they judged all the resources of the enemy greater and their own less than they were in reality 45 When Nero had attained to such a distance from the enemy that his design might be disclosed with safety he addressed his soldiers in a few words tell ing them that no general had ever formed a design more daring in appearance and yet more safe in the execution than his that he was leading them to cer tain victory for as his colleague had not marched against that enemy until the senate had given him such a force both of infantry and cavalry as fully satisfied his utmost wishes and those troops more numerous and better provided than if he were to go against Han nibal himself the addition thus made to it whatever might be its intrinsic weight would certainly turn the scale in his favor As soon as the foe should hear in the field of battle and he would take care that they should not hear sooner that another consul and another army had arrived this single circumstance would in sure success A war was sometimes happily con cluded by the spreading of a report and incidents of HISTORY OF ROME BOOK XXVII 77 light moment frequently impelled men s minds to hope or fear That themselves would reap almost the whole fruits of the glory acquired by success for in all cases the last addition made to the acting force is sup posed to be most decisive of the business That they saw by the concourse of people attending with what admiration and with what warm attachment of all ranks their march was honored And in fact all the roads through which they passed were lined with men and women who crowded thither from all parts of the country uttering vows and prayers for their success intermixing praises of their glorious enter prise calling them the safeguard of the commonwealth the champions of the city and of the empire of Rome on whose arms and on whose valor were reposed the safety and liberty of themselves and of their children They prayed to all the gods and goddesses to grant them a prosperous march a successful battle and speedy victory that they themselves might be bound by the event to pay the vows they offered in their be half and that as they now with minds full of solici tude accompanied them on their way so they might in a few days go out with hearts overflowing with joy to meet them in triumph Every one gave them warm invitations offered them every accommodation and pressed them with the most earnest intreaties to take from him rather than from another whatever was re quisite for themselves or their cattle in a word every thing that was wanted they with cheerfulness supplied in abundance Tbeir kindness was equalled by the moderation of the soldiers who would not accept of any matter whatever beyond their necessary occasions They never halted on any account nor quitted their ranks to take their victuals but marched day and night scarcely allowing themselves rest enough to answer the calls of nature Couriers were sent forward to the other consul to give notice of their coming and to know from him whether he chose that they should ap proach secretly or openly by night or by day whether they should lodge in the same camp with him or in 78 livy another It was judged best that they should join hitri secretly in the night 46 Orders were previously given by the consul Li vius that on their arrival each tribune should be accommodated with a lodging by a tribune each cen turion by a centurion each horseman by a horseman and each footman by a footman He considered that it would not be prudent to enlarge the camp lest the enemy might discover the coming of the second cou sul while the crowding together of additional num bers into lodgings in a narrow space would be at tended with the less inconvenience as the troops of Claudius had brought with them hardly any thing ex cept their arms Claudius had augmented his army with a number of volunteers for many both veteran soldiers discharged from service and young men of fered themselves on his march and as they eagerly pressed to be employed he enlisted such of them as from their personal appearance seemed fit for the service The camp of Livius was near Sena and Hasdrubal lay about five hundred paces beyond it Wherefore Nero to avoid entering it before night halted when he came nigh and where he was con cealed behind mountains As darkness came on his men marching silently were conducted into tents each by a person of his own rank where they were hospitably entertained amid mutual congratulations and unbounded joy Next day a council was held at which was also present the pretor Lucius Porcius Li cinus At this time his camp was joined to that of the consuls It should however be noticed that before their coming he had often baffled and perplexed the enemy leading his troops along the high ground sometimes seizing narrow defiles to arrest his march sometimes harassing him by attacks on his rear or flanks and putting in practice indeed every art of war He now assisted at the council Many were of opinion that an engagement should be deferred until Nero might refresh his men who were fatigued by their long march and want of sleep and also that he HISTORY OF ROME BOOK XXVII 79 should take a few days to himself to gain some know lege of the enemy Nero with the utmost earnestness iutreated them not by delays to render his enter prise rash in effect when dispatch would insure its success In consequence of a deception which could not last long Hannibal lay yet in a manner motion less he neither assailed his camp left as it was with out its commander nor moved a step in pursuit of him Before he should stir Hasdrubal s army might be cut off and he himself might return into Apulia Whoever by procrastination allowed time to the ene my would thereby betray the other camp to Hannibal and open for him a road into Gaul so as to enable him at bis leisure to effect a junctioti with Hasdrubal and whenever he pleased They ought to give the sig nal instantly march out to battle and to take every advantage of the delusion under which the enemy lay both the party in their neighborhood and the other at a distance while the latter knew not that their oppo nents were decreased in number nor the former that theirs were become more numerous and powerful Accordingly the council was dismissed the signal of battle was displayed and the troops immediately marched out to the field 47 The Carthaginians were already drawn up in order of battle before their camp The only thing that prevented an immediate engagement was that Hasdru bal having with a few horsemen advanced before the line remarked among the enemy some old shields which he had not seen before and horses leaner than any he had hitherto observed their number also seemed greater than usual On which suspecting what was the case he hastily sounded a retreat sent a party to the watering place at the river with orders to pick up if possible some prisoners also to observe attentively whether there were any whose complexions were more sun burned than usual as from a journey lately made at the same time ordering another party to ride round the camp at a distance to mark whether the rampart had been extended on any side and to watch whether 80 LIVY the signal was sounded a second time Though he received account of all these particulars yet the cir cumstance of the camp s not being enlarged led to a false conclusion they were two as before the arrival of the second consul one belonging to Marcus Livius the other to Lucius Porcius and no addition had been made to the trenches of either to make more room for tents within One thing particularly struck that vete ran commander long accustomed to act against Roman armies which was that according to the information of his scouts the signal was sounded once in the pre tor s camp and twice in the consuls Hence he con cluded that the two consuls must be there but how to account for Nero s having left Hannibal behind per plexed him extremely Of all things he could the least suspect what had really happened that Hannibal could be so blinded and in a business of such magni tude as not to know where the general was and where the army whose camp stood facing his own He sup posed that some disaster of no ordinary kind must have hindered him from following and he began to fear greatly that he himself had come too late with succor that his affairs were too desperate to be re trieved and that the same fortune which the Romans had met in Spain awaited them now in Italy He even conjectured that his letter had not reached his brother and that in consequence of its being inter cepted the consul had hastened thither to overpower him Distracted by these doubts and fears he extin guished all his fires and at the first watch ordered his troops to strike their tents in silence and to march In the hurry and confusion of a movement by night the guides were not watched with the necessary care and attention one of them therefore stopped in a place of concealment which he had before fixed on in his mind and the other swam across the river Me taurus at a pass with which he was acquainted The troops thus left destitute of conductors strayed for some time through the country and many overcome by drowsiness and fatigue stretched themselves on the HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXVII 81 ground in various places leaving the standards thinly attended Hasdrubal until daylight should discover a road ordered the army to proceed along the bank of the river and as he wandered along the turnings and windings with which that river remarkably abounds he made but little progress still intending however to cross it as soon as the day enabled him to find a convenient passage But the farther he removed from the sea the higher did he find the banks so that not meeting with a ford and wasting the day in the search he gave the enemy time to overtake him 48 First Nero with all the cavalry came up then Porcius with the light infantry While they harassed his wearied army by frequent assaults on every side and while the Carthaginian now stopping his march or rather flight had a mind to encamp on a high spot of ground on the bank of the river Livius arrived with the main body of infantry armed and marshalled for imme diate action When the Romans had united all their forces and the line was drawn out in array Claudius took the command of the right wing Livius of the left that of the centre was given to the pretor Hasdrubal laying aside the design of fortifying a camp when he saw the necessity of fighting placed his elephants in front before the battalions and beside them on the left wing he opposed the Gauls to Claudius not that he had much confidence in them but thinking that they were much dreaded by the enemy The right  wing which was to oppose Livius he took to himself together with the Spaniards on whom as being vete ran troops he placed his principal reliance The Li gurians were posted in the centre behind the elephants but the line was too long in proportion to its depth A rising ground in their front protected the Gauls and while that part of the line which was composed of the Spaniards engaged the left wing of the Romans their right wing stretching out beyond the extent of the fight stood idle for the eminence between them and the enemy prevented their making an attack either on their front or flank Between Livius and Hasdru liv vol v F 82 LIVY bal a furious conflict began and dreadful slaughter was made on both sides for here were both the gene rals here the greater part of the Roman infantry and cavalry here the Spaniards veteran troops and ac quainted with the Roman manner of fighting and the Ligurians a race of hardy warriors To the same part the elephants were driven which at the first onset disordered the van and made even the battalions give ground but afterwards the contest growing hotter and the shouts louder they soon became disobedient to the directions of their riders rambling up and down between the two lines without distinguishing their own party and ranging to and fro not unlike ships without rudders Claudius in vain attempted to ad vance up the hill often calling out thus to his men â To what purpose then have we with so much speed marched over such a length of way V However see ing it impracticable to reach the enemy s line in that quarter he drew away some cohorts from his right wing where the troops would not be able to act and led them round behind the line Then to the surprise not only of the enemy but of his friends also he made a brisk attack on their right flank and so quick were his motions that almost at the same instant when his men appeared on the flank they likewise attacked the rear Thus the Spaniards and Ligurians were cut to pieces on all sides in front and flank and rear and the havoc in a short time reached the Gauls These made very little opposition  for great numbers of them were absent from their posts having slipped away in the night and lain down in the fields while those who were present being exhausted by fatigue and want of sleep and being naturally ill qualified to endure toil had scarcely strength remaining sufficient to support their armor By this time it was mid day and while they were panting with heat and thirst they were slain or taken at the will of the Romans 49 Of the elephants more were killed by their guides than by the enemy These carried a knife like that used by shoemakers with a mallet and when the HISTORY OF ROME BOOK XXVII 83 animals began to grow furious and to rush on their own party the manager of each fixing this instrument between its ears on the joint which connects the head with tbe neck drove it in with the strongest blow that he could give This had been found the speediest me thod of killing animals of that great size when they had become so unruly as to leave no hope of managing them and it had been first brought into practice by Hasdrubal whose conduct in the command of an army as on many other occasions so particularly in this battle merited very high encomiums By his exhor tations and by taking an equal share in the dangers he supported the spirits of his men  and at one time by intreaties at another by reproofs he reanimated the wearied when from the length and labor of the action they were disposed to lay down their arms He called back the ffying and restored the battle in many places where it had been given up At last when Fortune evidently declared for the Romans un willing to survive so great an army which had fol lowed his standard on the credit of his reputation he set spurs to his horse and plunged himself into the midst of a Roman cohort where as became the son of Hamilcar and the brother of Hannibal he fell fight ing In no one action during that war were so great numbers of the enemy slain so much so indeed that the damage retorted on him was deemed equivalent to that sustained at Cannse Fifty six thousand of them were killed and five thousand four hundred taken The other booty was great of every kind as well as of gold and silver Besides which there were recovered above four thousand Roman citizens prisoners which was some consolation for the soldiers lost in the battle for the victory was far from a bloodless one nearly eight thousand of the Romans and allies being killed And so far were even the victors satiated with blood and slaughter that next day when the consul Livius was told that the Cisalpine Gauls and Ligurians who had either not been present in the battle or had made their escape from the general carnage were marching 84 LIVY off in a body without any certain leader without standards without order or subordination and that they might all be cut off if one squadron of horse were sent against them he answered Let some be left alive to carry home accounts of the enemy s losses and of our valor 50 On the night which followed the battle Nero set out on his return and by marches even speedier than he had made in coming on the sixth day after reached his former post opposite the enemy The crowds of people attending him were less than before because no messenger had preceded him but these exhibited such demonstrations of joy as to seem trans ported almost beyond their reason It is impossible to express or describe the emotions that agitated the minds of all persons at Rome either while waiting in doubtful expectation of the event or when they re ceived the news of the victory The senators never quitted the senate house nor the magistrates nor the people the forum from the rising to the setting sun during the whole of Claudius march so eager were they to greet him The matrons incapable themselves of contributing aid had recourse to prayers and sup plications and going about from one temple to ano ther wearied the gods with their intreaties and their vows While the public were in this painful sus pense first an unauthenticated rumor spread that two Narnian horsemen had come from the field of battle to the camp which stood on the frontiers of Umbria with intelligence that the enemy were utterly defeated For some time this news though listened to was but little credited as being too great and too joyful for the people s minds to admit or readily believe and even the quickness of the conveyance was urged as an objection to the truth of it as the account said that the battle was fought only two days before Soon after this a letter was brought from the camp by Lu cius Manlius Acidinus confirming the arrival of the Narnian horsemen This letter being carried through the forum to the pretor s tribunal brought out the HISTORY OF ROME BOOK XXVII 85 senate from their house and the people thronged to gether with such impatience and tumult to the door that the messenger could not approach but was dragged about amid a multitude of questions and all demanding with much vociferation that the letter should be read from the rostrum even before it was submitted to the senate At length they were reduced to order by the magistrates and obliged to make room that the joyful tidings might be regularly imparted to the public who were unable to govern their trans ports The dispatch was accordingly read first in the senate then in the assembly of the people some embracing the joyful news as certain while others refused to credit any thing until they should hear it from the deputies or the letters of the consuls 51 After some time an account was brought that deputies were really coming and not far off On this people of all ages ran out eagerly to meet them each coveting to receive from his own eyes and ears con vincing proofs of the reality of such a happy event One continued train reached all the way to the Mul vian bridge the deputies were Lucius VeturiusPhilo Publius Licinius Varus and Quintus Caecilius Me tellus Surrounded by a vast multitude of every sort they went on to the forum while some inquired of them others of their attendants concerning what had been done and as soon as any one heard that the enemy s general and army had been cut off that the Roman legions were safe and the consuls unhurt he immediately communicated his own joy to others When the deputies had with much difficulty reached the senate house and the crowd was with much greater difficulty obliged to retire that they might not mix with the senators the letters were read in the senate and then the deputies were brought out into the general assembly Lucius Veturius after reading the dispatches gave in bis own words a fuller detail of all that had passed which was heard with the greatest delight and was at last followed by a uni versal shout from the whole assembly who were un 86 Livy able to restrain the effusions of their joy They then separated some hastening to the temples of the gods to return thanks some to their own houses to impart the happy news to their wives and children The se nate in consideration of the consuls Marcus Livius and Cains Claudius having cut off the general and the legions of the enemy decreed a supplication for three days which supplication the pretor Cains Hostilius proclaimed in the assembly and it was performed with great devotion by all both men and women During the whole three days all the temples were equally filled with crowds whose numbers never diminished whilst the matrons dressed in the most splendid man ner and accompanied by their children being now delivered from every apprehension just as if the war were at an end offered thanksgivings to the immortal gods This victory produced also a powerful effect on the internal business of the state insomuch that peo ple immediately took courage to hold commerce with each other as in time of peace buying selling lend ing and paying money due The consul Claudius on returning to his camp ordered the head of Hasdrubal which he had carefully kept and brought with him to be thrown before the advanced guards of the enemy and the African prisoners chained as they were to be exposed to their view Two of these he also unbound and sent to Hannibal with orders to inform him of what had happened We are told that Hannibal deeply struck by a disaster so fatal to his country and his house said that he felt now the fortune of Car thage He then decamped and retired thence de signing to draw together into Bruttium the remotest corner of Italy all those confederates whom while scattered at wide distances he could not protect and he removed from their own habitations and carried away into Bruttium all the Metapontines and such of the Lucanians as acknowleged his authority HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXVIII 87 BOOK XXVIII Chap 1 At the time when in consequence of Has drubal s removing his forces Spain seemed to be re lieved of so much of the burden of the war as had been thrown on Italy hostilities suddenly revived there with the same violence as before The possessions of the Romans and Carthaginians in Spain at that time were thus situated Hasdrubal son of Gisgo had with drawn quite to the ocean and Gades the coast of our sea and almost all that part of Spain which lies to the eastward was under the power of Scipio and the do minion of the Romans Hanno the new general who had come over from Africa with a new army in the room of Hasdrubal Barcas and joined Mago having quickly armed a great number of men in Celtiberia an inland province equidistant from both seas Scipio to oppose him sent Marcus Silanus with only ten thousand foot and five hundred horse Silanus pro ceeded with all possible expedition and though his march was impeded by the ruggedness of the roads and by defiles surrounded with thick woods which are met with in most parts of Spain yet taking for guides some of the natives who bad deserted from Celtiberia he came up with the Carthaginians before any mes senger or even any report of his approach had reached them From deserters he also receiyed information when he was about ten miles distant from the enemy that they had two camps one on each side of the road in which he was marching that the Celtiberians who were newly raised forces amounting to more than nine thousand men formed the camp on the left the Car thaginians that on the right that the latter was strong and secured by outposts watches and every regular military guard the other disorderly and negligently guarded being composed of barbarians who were but lately enlisted and were under the less apprehension because they were in their own country Silanus re 88 LIVY solving to charge this division first ordered the troops to direct their course a great way to the left so as not to come within view of the posts of the Carthaginians and having despatched scouts before him he advanced in a brisk march to attack the enemy 2 He had arrived within about three miles and not one of the enemy had yet descried him craggy rocks interspersed with thick bushes covered the hills Here in a valley so deep as to be out of the way of observation he ordered his men to halt and take re freshment the scouts in the mean time arrived con firming the intelligence given by the deserters On this the Romans collecting the baggage into the centre armed themselves and moved forward in regular order At the distance of a mile they were perceived by the enemy among whom their appearance immediately created much hurry and confusion On the first shout Mago rode up in full speed from his camp Now there were in the Celtiberian army four thousand targeteers and two hundred horsemen this regular legion and it was almost the whole of their strength he placed in the first line the rest who were lightly armed he posted in reserve While he was leading them out of the camp in this order and when they had scarcely got clear of the rampart the Romans discharged their javelins at them  these the Spaniards stooped to avoid and then the enemy rose to discharge their own  which when the Romans in close array had received on their conjoined shields in their accustomed manner they immediately closed foot to foot and had recourse to their swards to determine the contest But the nneven ness of the ground at the same time that it rendered their agility useless to the Celtiberians who practise a desultory method of fighting was no disadvantage to the Romans accustomed to a steady fight except that the narrow passes and the bushes interspersed dis ordered their ranks and obliged them to engage one against one or two against two as if they had been matched for the combat The same circumstance which prevented the enemy from flying delivered them up as HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXVIII 89 if in Tellers to slaughter The targeteers of the Celti berians being thus almost intirely cut off the light troops and the Carthaginians who had come from the other camp to support them were quickly routed and put to the sword About two thousand foot and all the cavalry fled with Mago at the very onset Hanno the other general and those who came up last after the battle was decided were taken alive Almost the whole of the cavalry and what veteran infantry they bad following Mago in his flight came on the tenth day to Hasdrubal in the province of Gades the Celti berian soldiers being newly levied dispersed into the neighboring woods and thence escaped to their re spective homes By this seasonable victory was sup pressed a war which was not of so much importance on account of its present magnitude as of its being a foundation from which one much more considerable might have arisen had the enemy been allowed after having roused the Celtiberians to arms to persuade the other stales to join in the same cause Scipio therefore having bestowed liberal commendations on Silamis and seeing reason to hope that he might be able to finish the dispute at once by exerting himself with proper activity advanced into Farther Spain against Hasdrubal The Carthaginian who happened at that time to have his army in Baetica for the pur pose of securing the fidelity of his allies in that coun try decamping hastily led it away in a manner much more resembling a flight than a march quite to the ocean and Gades He was fearful however that as long as he kept bis forces together he should be con sidered as the primary object of the enemy s opera tions Before he passed over the strait to Gades he therefore dispersed them into the different cities in the view likewise that they might provide for their own safety by help of walls and for that of the towns by their arms 3 When Scipio found that the enemy s troops were thus widely scattered and that the carrying about his own to each of the several cities would be a very 90 LIVY tedious if not difficult work he marched hack his army Unwilling however to leave the possession of all that country to the Carthaginians he sent his brother Lu cius Scipio with ten thousand foot and one thousand horse to lay siege to the most considerable city in those parts called by the barbarians Orinx situate on the borders of the Milesians a Spanish nation so calledâ a desirable spot the adjacent parts affording mines of silver and the soil being fruitful This place served Hasdrubal as a fortress whence he used to make incursions on the states around Scipio en camped near to it Before raising his works of cir cumvallation however he sent some persons to the gates to try the disposition of the inhabitants in a con ference and to recommend to them rather to make trial of the friendship than the power of the Romans As their answers showed no inclination to peace he surrounded the city with a trench and a double ram part breaking his army into three parts in order that one division might always carry on the attack while the other two rested When the first of these began the assault the contest was furious and desperate it was with the greatest difficulty that they could ap proach or bring up the ladders to the walls on ac count of the showers of weapons which fell on them and even of those who had raised them some were tumbled down with forks made for the purpose others found themselves in danger of being caught by iron grapples and of being dragged up on the wall When Scipio saw that his men were too few to make an im pression and that the enemy from the advantage of their works had even the better of the dispute he called off the first division and attacked with the two others at once This struck such terror into the be sieged already fatigued that not only the townsmen quickly forsook the walls but the Carthaginian gar rison fearing that the town had been betrayed like wise left their posts and collected themselves into a body The inhabitants on this were seized with ap prehensions lest the enemy if they broke into the HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXVIII 91 town should put to the sword every one they met without distinction whether Carthaginian or Spaniard They instantly therefore threw open one of the gates and rushed out of the town in crowds holding their shields before them lest any weapons should be cast at them and stretching out their right hands expanded to show that they had thrown away their swords Whether this latter circumstance was unobserved on account of the distance or whether some stratagem was suspected is uncertain but the deserters were attacked as enemies and put to death Through this gate the troops marched into the city in hostile array The other gates were broken open with axes and sledges and as soon as the horsemen entered they gallopped forward to secure the forum for such were the orders the veterans also were joined to the horse to support them The legionary soldiers spread them selves all over the city but neither slew nor plundered any except those who stood on their defence All the Carthaginians were put into confinement with above three hundred of the inhabitants who had shut the gates the rest had the town delivered up to them and their effects restored There fell in the assault of the enemy about two thousand of the Romans not more than ninety 4 As the capture of this city afforded matter of much exultation to those engaged in it so it rendered their approach to the camp a magnificent spectacle to the general and the rest of the army on account of the immense crowd of prisoners which they drove before them Scipio having declared his approbation of his brother s conduct and in the highest strains extolled his taking of Orinx as equal to his own taking of Car thage led back his forces into Hither Spain The approach of winter put it out of his power either to make an attempt on Gades or to pursue the army of Hasdrubal now dispersed in all parts of the province Dismissing therefore the legions to their winter quar ters and sending his brother Lucius Scipio with Hanno the enemy s general and other prisoners of distinction 92 LIVY to Rome he himself retired to Tarraco During the same year the Roman fleet under Marcus Valerius Laevinus proconsul sailing over from Sicily to Africa made extensive devastations in the territories of Utica and Carthage carrying off plunder from the remotest bounds of the Carthaginian territory even from under the very walls of Utica On their return to Sicily they were met by a Carthaginian fleet consisting of seventy ships of war seventeen of these they took and sunk four the rest were beaten and dispersed The Romans victorious by land and sea returned to Lilybaeum with immense booty of every kind The sea being thus cleared of the enemy abundance of provision was brought to Rome 5 In the beginning of the summer during which these transactions passed Publius Sulpicius procon sul and king Attalus after having wintered at JEgina as mentioned above united their fleets consisting of twenty three Roman five banked gallies and thirty five belonging to the king and sailed from thence to Lemnos Philip also that he might be prepared for every sort of exertion whether he should have occa sion to oppose the enemy on land or sea came down to the coast of Demetrias and appointed a day for his army to assemble at Larissa On the news of the king s arrival embassies from his allies came to Deme trias from all sides for the jEtolians elated both by their alliance with the Romans and by the approach of Attalus were ravaging the neighboring states Not only the Acarnanians Uoeotians and Euboeans were under violent apprehensions but the AchKans also were kept in terror as well by the hostilities of the iEtolians as by Machanidas tyrant of Lacedaemon who had pitched his camp at a small distance from the borders of the Argives All these representing the dangers both on land and sea with which their several possessions were threatened implored the king s as sistance Philip even from his own kingdom received accounts that affairs there were not in a state of tran quillity that both Scerdilaedus and Plcuratus were in HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXVIII 93 motion and that some of the Thracians particularly the Maedians would certainly make incursions into the adjoining provinces of Macedonia if the king should be employed in a distant war The Boeotians indeed and the people of the inland parts of Greece informed him that in order to prevent them from pass ing to the assistance of the allied states the straits of Thermopylae where the road is confined and con tracted to a very narrow breadth had been shut up by the jEtolians with a ditch and a rampart Sueh a number of disturbances on all sides were sufficient to rouse even an indolent leader he dismissed the am bassadors with promises of assisting them all as time and circumstances would permit He sent to Pepare thus a garrison for the city a business which required the utmost dispatch accounts having been received from thence that Attains had sailed over from Lemnos and was ravaging all the country round He de spatched Polyphantas with a small number of forces to Boeotia and likewise Menippus one of the officers of his guards with one thousand targeteers the target is not unlike the common buckler to Chalcis Agria num was reinforced with five hundred men that all parts of the island might be secured He himself went to Scotussa ordering the Macedonian troops to be brought over thither from Larissa He was there in formed that the Etolians had been summoned to an assembly at Heraclea and that king Attalus was to come to consult with them on the conduct of the war Resolving to disturb this meeting by his sudden ap proach he led his army by forced marches to Hera clea and arrived there just after the assembly had been dismissed However he destroyed the crops which were almost ripe particularly round the jEnian bay He then led back his forces to Scotussa and leaving there the body of his army retired with the royal guards to Demetrias That he might be in rea diness to meet every effort of the enemy he sent peo ple from hence to Phocis and Euboea and Peparethus to choose out eleyated situations where fires being 94 LIVY lighted might be seen from afar He fixed a beacon on Tisaeum a mountain whose summit is of an immense height that by means of lights on these eminences whenever the enemy made any attempt he might though distant receive instant intelligence of it The Roman general and king Attalus passed over from Pe parethus to Nicaea and from thence sailed to the city of Orcus which is the first city of Euboea on the left on the way from the bay of Demetrias to Chalcis and the Euripus 6 It was concerted between Attalus and Sulpicius that the Romans should assault the town on the side next the sea and at the same time make an attack on the king s forces on the land side Four days after the arrival of the fleet the operations began The in termediate time had been spent in private conferences with Plator who had been appointed by Philip to the command of the place There are two citadels one hanging over the coast the other in the middle of the town and from this there is a subterraneous passage to the ocean the entrance of which next to the sea is covered with a strong fortification a tower five stories in height Here the contest first commenced and that with the utmost violence the tower being well stored with all kinds of weapons these with engines and machines for the assault having been landed from the ships While the attention and eyes of all were drawn to that side Plator opening one of the gates received the Romans into the citadel next the sea of which they became masters in a moment The inhabitants driven thence fled to the other citadel in the middle of the city but troops had been posted there to keep the gates shut against them so that being thus ex cluded and surrounded they were all either slain or taken prisoners In the mean time the Macedonian garrison making no resistance stood in a compact body under the walls These men Plator having obtained leave from Sulpicius embarked in some ships and landed them at Demetrias in Phthiotis he himself withdrew to Attalus Sulpicius elated by his success HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXVIII 05 at Oreum so easily obtained proceeded with his vic torious fleet to Chalcis where the issue by uo means answered his expectations The sea from being pretty wide at each side is here contracted into a strait so very narrow that at first view the whole appears like two harbors facing the two entrances of the Euripus A more dangerous station for a fleet can hardly be found  for besides that the winds rush down suddenly and with great fury from the high mountains on each side the strait itself of the Euripus does not ebb and flow seven times a day at stated hours as report says but the current changing irregularly like the wind from one point to another is hurried along like a tor rent tumbling from a steep mountain so that night or day ships can never lie quiet But besides the pe rilous situation iu which his fleet lay he found that the town was firm and impregnable surrounded on one side by the sea extremely well fortified by land on the other secured by a strong garrison and above all by the fidelity of the commanders and principal inhabitants which character those at Oreum had not supported with honor or steadiness The Roman in a business rashly undertaken acted so far prudently that when he had seen all the difficulties attending it not to waste time he quickly desisted from the at tempt removing with his fleet from thence to Cynus in Locris the landing place for the city of Opus which lies at the distance of a mile from the sea 7 Philip had received notice from Oreum by the signal fires but through the treachery of Plator it was too late when they were raised on the beacons and as he was not a match for the enemy at sea it was difficult for him to approach the island he hesitated therefore and took no part in that business To the relief of Chalcis he flew with alacrity as soon as he perceived the signal for though Chalcis stands on the same island yet the strait which separates it from the continent is so narrow that there is a communi cation between them by a bridge and the approach to it is easier by land than by water Philip therefore  ys LIVY Laving gone from Demetrias to Scotussa and setting out thence at the third watch dislodged the guard routed the Etolians who kept possession of the pass of Thermopylae and drove the dismayed enemy to Heraclea accomplishing in one day a march of above sixty miles to Elatia in Phocis About the same time the city of Opus was taken and plundered by Attalus Sulpicius had given it up to the king because Oreum had been sacked a few days before by the Roman sol diers and his men had received no share After the Roman fleet had retired to Oreum Attalus not ap prised of Philip s approach wasted time in levying contributions from the principal inhabitants and so unexpected was his coming that had not some Cre tans who happened to go in quest of forage farther from the town than usual espied the enemy he might have been surprised Without arms and in the ut most confusion he fled precipitately to his ships Just as they were putting off from the land Philip came up and though he did not advance from the shore yet his arrival caused a good deal of confusion among the mariners From thence he returned to Opus inveigh ing against gods and men for his disappointment in having the opportunity of striking so important a blow thus snatched from him and when almost within reach of his arm The Opuntians also he rebuked in angry terms because although they might have prolonged the siege until he arrived yet they had immediately on sight of the enemy made almost a voluntary sur render Having put affairs at Opus in order he pro ceeded thence to Thronium On the other side At talus at first retired to Oreum but having heard there that Prnsias king of Bithynia had invaded his king dom he laid aside all attention to the affairs of the Romans and the jEtolian war and passed over into Asia Sulpicius too withdrew his fleet to Mgi na from whence he had set out in the beginning of spring Philip found as little difficulty in possessing himself of Thronium as Attalus had met at Opus This city was inhabited by foreigners natives of HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXVIII 97 Thebes in Phthiotis who when their own was taken by the Macedonian had fled for protection to the Etolians and had obtained from them a settlement in this place which had been laid waste and deserted in the former war with the same Philip After recover ing Thronium in the manner related he continued bis route and haying taken Tritonos and Drymae incon siderable towns of Doris he came thence to Elatia where he had ordered the ambassadors of Ptolemy and the Rhodians to wait for him While they were deliberating there on the method of putting an end to the jEtolian war for the ambassadors had been pre sent at the late assembly of the Romans and JStolians at Heraclea news was brought that Machanidas intended to attack the people of Elis while they were busied in preparations for solemnising the Olym pic games Judging it incumbent on him to prevent such an attempt he dismissed the ambassadors with a favorable answer that  he had neither given cause for the war nor would give any obstruction to a peace provided it could be procured on just and honorable terms then proceeding through Boeotia by quick marches he came down to Megara and from thence to Corinth and receiving there supplies of provision repaired to Phlius and Pheneus When he had ad vanced as far as Heraea intelligence was brought him that Machanidas terrified at the account of his ap proach had retreated to Lacedaemon on which he withdrew to yEgium where the Achaeans were assem bled in council expecting at the same time to meet there a Carthaginian fleet which he had sent for in order that he might be able to undertake some enter prise by sea But the Carthaginians had left that place a few days before and were gone to the Oxean islands and from thence on hearing that the Romans and Attalns had left Oreum to the harbors of the Acarnanians for they apprehended that an attack was intended against themselves and that they might be overpowered while within the straits of Rhios so the entrance of the Corinthian bay is called LIV VOL V G 98 livv 8 Philip was filled with grief and vexation when he found that although he had on all occasions made the most spirited and speedy exertions yet fortune had haffled his activity by snatching away every ad vantage when he had it within his view In the as sembly however concealing his chagrin he spoke with great confidence appealing to gods and men that at no time or place had he ever been remiss that wherever the sound of the enemy s arms was heard thither he had instantly repaired but that it could hardly be determined whether in the management of the war his forwardness or the enemy s cowardice was more conspicuous in such a dastardly manner had Attains slipped out of his hands from Opus Sulpicius from Chalcis and in the same way within these few days Machanidas That flight however did not al ways succeed and that a war should not be accounted difficult in which victory would be certain if the foe could be brought to a regular engagement One ad vantage however and that of the first magnitude he had already acquiredâ the confession of the enemy themselves that they were not a match for him and in a short time he said  he should have to boast of undoubted conquest for whenever the enemy would meet him in the field they should find the issue no better than they seemed to expect This discourse of the king was received by the allies with great plea sure He then gave up to the Achaeans Heraea and Triphylia Aliphera he restored to the Megalopoli tans they having produced sufficient evidence that it belonged to their territories Having received some vessels from the Achaeans three galleys of four and three of two banks of oars he sailed to Anticyra from thence with seven ships of five banks and above twenty barks which he had sent to the bay of Corinth to join the Carthaginian fleet he proceeded to Erythrae a town of the jEtolians near Eupalium and there made a descent He was not unobserved by the Mio lians for all who were either in the fields or in the neighboring forts of Apollonia and Potidania fled to HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXVIII 99 the woods and mountains The cattle which they could not drive off in their hurry were seized and put on board With these and the other booty he sent Nicias pretor to the Achaeans to Egium and going to Corinth he ordered his army to march by land through Bosotia while he himself sailing from Cen chrea along the coast of Attica round the promontory of Sunium reached Chalcis after passing almost through the middle of the enemy s fleet Having highly commended the fidelity and bravery of the in habitants in not suffering either fear or hope to in fluence their minds and having exhorted them to per severe in maintaining the alliance with the same con stancy if they preferred their present situation to that of the inhabitants of Oreum and Opus he sailed to Oreum and having there conferred the direction of affairs and the command of the city on such of the chief inhabitants as had chosen to fly rather than sur render to the Romans he sailed over from Euboea to Demetrias from whence he had at first set out to assist his allies Soou after he laid the keels of one hundred ships of war at Cassandria collecting a great number of ship carpenters to finish the work and as the seasonable assistance which he had afforded his allies in their distress and the departure of Attalns bad restored tranquillity in the affairs of Greece he withdrew into his own kingdom with an intention of making war on the Dardanians 9 Towards the end of the summer during which these transactions passed in Greece Quintus Fabius son of Maximus who served as lieutenant general brought a message from Marcus Livius the consul to the senate at Rome in which he gave it as his opinion that Lucius Porcius with his legions was sufficient to secure the province of Gaul and that he himself might depart thence and the consular army be with drawn On which the senate ordered not only Mar cus Livius but his colleague also Caius Claudius to return to the city In their decree they made only this differenceâ that Marcus Livius army be withdrawn 100 LIVY but that Nero s legions remain in the province to oppose Hannibal It had been concerted between the consuls by letter that as they had been of one mind in the ma nagement of affairs so they should arrive together at one time in the city though they were to come from diffe rent quarters whichever came first to Praeneste being directed to wait there for his colleague It so hap pened that they both arrived at that town on the same day and then having sent forward a proclamation requiring a full meeting of the senate in the temple of Bellona on the third day after they advanced to wards the city from whence the whole multitude poured out to meet them The surrounding crowds were not satisfied with saluting them though but at a little distance each pressed eagerly forward to touch the victorious hands of the consuls some con gratulating others giving them thanks for having by their valor procured safety to the state In the se nate having given a recital of their exploits accord ing to the usual practice of commanders of armies they demanded that  on account of their bravery and success in the conduct of affairs due honors might be paid to the immortal gods and they themselves al lowed to enter the city in triumph To which the se nate answered that  they decreed with pleasure the matters contained in their demand as a proper return due first to the gods and after the gods to the con suls A thanksgiving in the name of both and a triumph to each had been decreed the consuls how ever wishing that as their sentiments had been united during the course of the war their triumphs should not be separated came to this agreement between themselves â that inasmuch as the business had been accomplished within the province of Marcus Livius and as on the day whereon the battle was fought it happened to be his turn to command and as the army of Livius had been withdrawn and was now at Rome while Nero s could not be withdrawn from the pro vince it should on all these accounts be ordered that Marcus Livius make his entry in a chariot drawn by HISTORY OF ROME 101 â BOOK XXVIII four horses attended by the troops Caius Claudius Nero on horseback without troops As the uniting of their triumphs in this manner enhanced the glory of both the consuls so it reflected peculiar honor on him who condescended to appear in the procession as much inferior to his colleague in magnificence as he was superior to him in merit People said that  the commander on horseback had in the space of six days traversed the extent of Italy and had fought a pitched battle with Hasdrubal in Gaul on the very day when Hannibal imagined he was lying in his camp opposite to him in Apulia that thus this single consul equal to the defence of both extremities of Italy against two armies and two generals had opposed against one bis skill against the other his person That the very name of Nero had been sufficient to confine Hannibal to his camp and as to Hasdrubal by what other means than by the arrival of Nero had he been over whelmed and cut off The other consul therefore might proceed in his stately chariot he was drawn indeed by a number of horses but the real triumph belonged to him who had only one and that Nero though he should go on foot deserved to be for ever celebrated both for having acquired so much glory in the war and shown so much indifference to the pomp ous display of it in the present procession With such encomiums did the spectators attend Nero through his whole progress to the capitol The con suls carried to the treasury three hundred thousand sesterces in money and eighty thousand asses2 of brass to the soldiers Marcus Livius distributed fifty six asses3 each Caius Claudius promised the same sum to his absent troops as soon as he should return to the army It was remarked that the soldiers on that day directed more of their military songs and verses to Caius Claudius than to their own com mander that the horsemen distinguished Lucius Ve turius and Quintus Coecilius lieutenants general by extraordinary praises exhorting the commons to ap Â 24 218 15s 3 2561 6s Sd 3 3s 7 d 102 LIVY point them consuls for the next year and that both Livius and Nero added their authority to this recom mendation representing next day in the assembly the bravery and fidelity which the said lieutenants general had manifested in the service 10 When the time of the elections arrived as it had been determined that they should be held by a dictator the consul Caius Claudius nominated his col league Marcus Livius to that office Livius appointed Quintus Caecilius master of the horse By Marcus Li vius were elected consuls Lucius Veturius and Quin tus Caecilius who was then master of the horse The election of pretors was next held there were ap pointed Caius Servilius Marcus Caecilius Metellus Tiberius Claudius Asellus and Quintus Mamilius Tu rinus at that time plebeian edile When the elections were finished the dictator having laid down his office and dismissed his army set out for his province of Etruria in pursuance of a decree of the senate in order to make inquiries what states of the Tuscans or Umbrians had on the approach of Hasdrubal formed schemes of revolting to him from the Romans or who had afforded him men provisions or any kind of aid Such were the transactions of that year at home and abroad The Roman games were thrice repeated by the curule ediles Cneius Servilius Caspio and Servius Cornelius Lentulus The plebeian games also were once repeated intire by the plebeian ediles Manias Pomponius Matho and Quintus Mamilius Thurinus A U C 646 B C 206 In the thirteenth year of the Punic war when Lucius Veturius Philo and Quin tus Cheilius Metellus were consuls they were both appointed to the province of Bruttium to conduct the war against Hannibal The pretors then cast lots for their provinces the business of the city fell to Mar cus Caecilius Metellus the jurisdiction in relation to foreigners to Quintus Mamilius Sicily to Caius Servilius and Sardinia to Tiberius Claudius The armies were thus distributed to one of the consuls that which had been under Caius Claudius the consul of the former year to the other that which had been HISTORY OF ROME 103 â BOOK XXVIII under Quintus Claudius propretor they consisted each of two legions It was decreed that Marcus Livius proconsul whose command had heen prolonged for a year should receive two legions of volunteer slaves from Caius Terentius propretor in Etruria and that Quintus Mamilius should transfer his judicial employ ment to his colleague and take the command in Gaul with the army which had belonged to Lucius Porcius propretor orders at the same time being given him to lay waste the lands of the Gauls who had revolted on the approach of Hasdrubal The protection of Sicily was given in charge to Caius Servilius with the two legions of Cannae as Caius Mamilius had held it From Sardinia the old army which had served under Aulus Hostilius was brought home and the consuls levied a new legion which Tiberius Claudius was to carry with him Quintus Claudius and Caius Hos tilius Tubulus were continued in command for a year that the former might hold Tarentum as his province the latter Capua Marcus Valerius proconsul who had been intrusted with the defence of the sea coasts round Sicily was ordered to deliver thirty ships to Caius Servilius and to return home with all the rest of the fleet 11 While the public was under much anxiety on account of the great danger and importance of the war and ever apt to refer to the gods the causes of all their successes and disappointments accounts were propa gated of a number of prodigies that at Tarracina the temple of Jupiter at Satricum that of Mother Ma tuta had been struck by lightning the people being also greatly terrified by two snakes creeping into the former unperceived through the very door From An tium it was reported that ears of corn had appeared bloody to the reapers At Caere a pig had been littered with two heads and a lamb yeaned which was of both sexes It was said also that two suns had been seen at Alba and that light had burst forth on a sudden during the night time at Fregellae An ox it was as serted had spoken in the neighborhood of Rome and a profuse sweat had flowed from the altar of Neptune 104 LIVY in the Flaminian circus and also that the temples of Ceres Safety and Romulus were struck by lightning These prodigies the consuls were ordered to expiate with the greater victims and to perform a solemn sup plication to the gods during one day all which was strictly observed in pursuance of a decree of the se nate But what struck more terror into men s minds than all these ominous and preternatural appearances at home or abroad was the extinction of the fire in the temple of Vesta and for which the vestal who had the watch for that night was whipped to death by order of the pontiff Publius Licinius Although this extinction was occasioned not by the gods directing it as a por tent but by the negligence of a human being yet it was thought proper that it should be expiated by the greater victims and that a supplication should be so lemnised at the temple of Vesta Before the consuls set out to the campaign they received directions from the senate to take measures to make the common people return to their lands in the country where they might now reside in safety as by the favor of the gods the war had been removed to a distance from the city of Rome and from Latium for it was quite in consistent to pay more attention to the cultivation of Sicily than to that of Italy It was however no easy matter to obtain a compliance with this injunction the laborers of free condition were most of them lost in the war slaves were searce the cattle had been carried off in booty and their dwellings thrown down and burnt Nevertheless a great number compelled by the authority of the consuls returned as directed The mention of this affair had been occasioned by de puties from Placentia and Cremona who complained that incursions were made on them by the neighboring Gauls that a great part of their settlers had dispersed that their cities were thinly inhabited and their terri tory waste and deserted A charge was given to the pretor Mamilius to protect the colonies from the ene my The consuls in pursuance of the decree of the senate issued an edict that all the citizens of Cremona and Placentia should return before a certain day to HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXVIII 105 those colonies and then in the beginning of the spring they set out to carry on the war Quintus Ciecilius consul received his army from Caius Nero Lucius Veturius his from Quintus Claudius propretor he filling it up with the new levies which himself had raised They led their forces into the territory of Consentia Here having made great ravages the troops now loaded with spoil were thrown into such confusion in a narrow pass by some Bruttians and Numidian spearmen that not only that spoil but them selves were in extreme danger However there was more tumult than fighting the booty was sent for ward and the legions without loss made their way to places of safety From thence they advanced against the Lucanians which whole nation returned without a contest into subjection to the Roman people 12 No action took place during that year between them and Hannibal for the Carthaginian after the deep wound so lately given both to his own private and to the public welfare cautiously avoided throwing himself in their way and the Romans did not choose to rouse him from his inactivity such powers did they suppose that leader possessed of in his single person though all things round him were falling into ruin In truth I know not whether he was more deserving of admiration in adversity or in prosperity consider ing that though he carried on war for thirteen years and that in an enemy s territory so far from home with various success with an army not composed of his own countrymen but made up of the refuse of all nations who had neither law nor custom nor language in common who were of different stature had dif ferent garb different arms different rites and almost different gods yet he so bound them together by some common tie that neither among themselves nor against their commander did any sedition ever appear al though in a hostile country he often wanted both mo ney to pay them and provisions also â wants which in the former Punic war had occasioned many distress ful scenes between the generals and their men Butt 106 LIVY after the destruction of Hasdrubal and his army on whom he had reposed all his hopes of victory and when he had given up the possession of all the rest of Italy and withdrawn into a corner of Bruttium must it not appear wonderful to all that no disturbance arose in his camp for there was this afflicting circum stance in addition to all his other difficulties that he had no hope of being able even to procure food for his soldiers except from the lands of Bruttium which if they were intirely under tillage were too small for the support of so large an army Besides the war had employed a great part of the young men and carried them away from the cultivation of the grounds a base practice likewise prevailing through the whole nation of making plundering excursions on every side nor were there any remittances made him from home where the whole attention of the public was engaged in endeavoring to keep possession of Spain as if affairs in Italy were all in a state of prosperity In the former the fortune of the parties was in one respect the same in another widely different the same so far that the Carthaginians being defeated in battle and having lost their general had been driven to the re motest coast of the country even to the ocean but different in this that Spain in the nature both of the ground and of the inhabitants affords greater conve niences for reviving a war not only than Italy but than any other part of the world and that was the reason that although tins was the first of all the pro vinces on the continent in which the Romans got foot ing yet it was the last subdued and that not until the present age under the conduct and auspices of Augustus Caesar In this country Hasdrubal son of Gisgo a general of the greatest abilities and character next to the Barcine family returning now from Gades and being encouraged to a renewal of the war by Mago the son of Hamilcar armed to the number of fifty thousand foot and four thousand five hundred horse by levies made in the Farther Spain In the number ef his cavalry authors are pretty well agreed of the HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXVIII 107 infantry according to some there were seventy thou sand led to the city of Silpia There the two Cartha ginian generals sat down in an extensive plain deter mined not to avoid a battle 13 When Scipio received the account of the army being assembled he saw plainly that with the Roman legions alone he could not oppose so great a multitude nor without using the auxiliary troops of the barba rians at least for the purpose of making a show of strength but that at the same time it was highly improper that they should compose such a proportion of his force as might enable them by changing sides to produce consequences of importanceâ an event which had caused the destruction of his father and uncle Sending forward therefore Silanus to Colca who was sovereign of twenty eight towns to receive from him the horse and foot which he had engaged to raise during the winter he set out himself from Tarraco and col lecting small bodies of auxiliaries from the allies who lay near his road proceeded to Castulo Hither Sila nus brought three thousand auxiliary foot and five hundred horse From thence he advanced to the city of Bascula his army amounting in the whole of his countrymen and allies horse and foot to forty five thousand While they were forming their camp Mago and Masinissa with the whole of their cavalry made an attack on them and would have dispersed the work men had not some horsemen whom Scipio had con cealed behind a hill conveniently situated for the pur pose suddenly rushed out as they advanced to the charge These at the first onset routed all who had pushed on foremost against the men employed in the fortification The contest with the rest who advanced on their march drawn up in regular order was longer and for some time doubtful But the light cohorts from the outposts the soldiers called off from the works and afterwards greater numbers who were or dered to take arms came up fresh and engaged the wearied enemy At the same time a large body rushed in arms from the camp to battle The Carthaginians 108 LIVY and Numidians then fairly turned their hacks and though at first they retreated in troops and without breaking their ranks yet when the Romans fell furi ously on their rear they thought no more of order but fled precipitately and dispersed into such places as each found convenient Although by this battle the spirits of the Romans were somewhat raised and those of the enemy depressed yet for several following days the horsemen and light troops were continually en gaged in skirmishes 14 After making trial of their strength in these slight engagements Hasdrubal led out his forces to the field then the Romans marched out Both armies stood in order of battle under their respective ram parts neither party choosing to begin the attack  when it was near sunset the Carthaginians first and then the Romans marched back into camp They acted in the same manner for several days the Carthaginian al ways drawing out his troops first and first giving the signal of retreat when they were fatigued with stand ing Neither side advanced in the least nor was a weapon discharged nor a word uttered The centre divisions of their lines were composed on one side of Romans on the other of Carthaginians and African auxiliaries the wings were formed by the allies who on both sides were Spaniards In front of the Cartha ginian line the elephants at a distance appeared like castles It was now generally said in both camps that they were to engage in the same order in which they had stood before and that their centres consisting of Romans and Carthaginians who were principals in the war would no doubt encouuter each other with equal courage and strength of arms When Scipio understood that this opinion was firmly entertained he took care to alter the whole plan against the day on which he intended to fight On the preceding evening therefore he gave out orders through the camp that the men and horses should be refreshed and accoutred before day and that the horsemen ready armed should keep their horses bridled and saddled Before it was HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXVIII 109 clear day he despatched all the cavalry and light in fantry with orders to charge the Carthaginian outposts and immediately advanced himself with the heavy body of the legions having contrary to the expectation both of his own men and the enemy strengthened the wings with his Roman troops and drawn the allies into the centre Hasdrubal was alarmed by the shout of the cavalry and springing out from his tent saw a bustle before the rampart his men in hurry and confusion the glittering standards of the legions at a distance and the plain filled with troops He immediately de spatched all his cavalry against that of the enemy marching himself from out of the camp with the body of infantry but in drawing up his line he made no alteration in the original disposition The contest be tween the horse had continued a long time doubtful nor could they decide it by their own efforts because when either were repulsed which happened to both in turn they found a safe refuge among the infantry But when the armies had approached within five hun dred paces of each other Scipio giving the signal for retreat and opening his files received all the cavalry and light troops through them and forming them in two divisions placed them in reserve behind the wings When he saw that it was time to begin the engage ment he ordered the Spaniards who composed the centre to advance with a slow pace and sent directions from the right wing where he commanded in person to Silanus and Marcius to extend their wing on the left in the same manner as they should see him stretch ing on the right and attack the enemy with the light armed forces of horse and foot before the centre could close The wings extending in this manner three co horts of foot and three troops of horse from each to gether with the light infantry advanced briskly against the enemy while the rest followed them in an oblique direction There was a bending in the centre because the battalions of Spaniards advanced slower than the wings and the wings had already encountered while the principal strength of the enemy s line the Cartha 110 LIVY ginian veterans and Africans were still at such a dis tance that they could not throw their javelins with effect nor did they dare to make detachments to the wings to support those who were engaged for fear of opening the centre to the forces advancing against it The Carthaginian wings were hard pressed being at tacked on all sides for the horse and foot together with the light infantry wheeling round fell in on their flanks while the cohorts pressed on them in front in order to separate the wings from the rest of the line 15 The battle was now very unequal in all parts not only because an irregular multitude of Balearians and undisciplined Spanish recruits were opposed to the Roman and Latine troops but as the day ad vanced Hasdrubal s troops began to grow faint hav ing been surprised by the alarm in the morning and obliged to hasten out to the field before they could take food to support their strength With a view to this Scipio had taken care to create delay for it was not until the seventh hour that the battalions of foot fell on the wings and the battle reached the centre somewhat later so that before the enemy began regu larly to engage they were enfeebled by the heat of the meridian sun the labor of standing under arms and by hunger and thirst distressing them at once They stood therefore leaning on their shields for in addi tion to their other misfortunes the elephants terrified at the desultory manner of fighting used by the horse and the light infantry had thrown themselves from the wings on the centre Harassed thus greatly both in body and mind they began to give way but still pre served their ranks as if the whole army were retreat ing by order of the general The victors perceiving the superiority which they had gained redoubled the fury of their assault on all sides so that the shock could hardly he sustained Hasdrubal however en deavored to stop his men crying out that  the hills in the rear would afford a safe refuge if they would but retreat without hurry yet fear overcame their shame and although such as were nearest the enemy still con HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXVIII Ill linued to fight they quickly turned their backs and all betook themselves to a hasty flight They halted however for a time at the foot of the hills endeavoring to restore order while the Romans hesitated to ad vance their line against the opposite steep But when they saw the battalions pressing forward briskly they renewed their flight and were driven in a panic within their works The Romans were not far from the ram part and continuing their efforts had nearly sur mounted it when such a quantity of rain poured sud denly down that it was with difficulty they regained their camp The sun too had been excessively hot as is usually the case when shining forth from among clouds surcharged with water which added greatly to the fatigues of the day Some were even seized with a religious scruple against attempting any thing farther at that time Though both night and the rain invited the Carthaginians to take the repose so necessary to them yet fear and the impending danger would not admit of it and as they had reason to expect an as sault from the enemy at the first light they raised the height of the rampart with stones collected from the adjacent valleys endeavoring to secure themselves by fortifications since they found no protection in their arms But the desertion of their allies soon gave them reason to think that it was the safer way to fly The beginning of this revolt arose from Attanes prince of the Turdetans who deserted with a great number of his countrymen and afterwards two fortified towns with their garrisons were delivered to the Romans by their commanders Hasdrubal dreading since a dis position to throw off the Carthaginian yoke had onoe seized their minds that the evil might spread farther decamped during the silence of the ensuing night 16 At the first light the outgitards having brought intelligence of the enemy s departure Scipio sending forward the cavalry gave orders to the army to march and these were executed with such expedition that bad they directly pursued the track of the fugitives they had certainly overtaken them but they were 112 LIVY persuaded by their guides that there was another and a shorter road to the river Bastis and where it was said they might attack them in their passage Has drubal finding the ford in possession of the enemy changed his course directing it towards the ocean  his army now retreating with precipitancy so that the Ro man legions were left at some distance behind How ever the horse and the light infantry harassed and de layed them by attacking sometimes their rear some times their flanks and as they were obliged to halt frequently on occasion of these interruptions and to support the attacks at one time of the horse at another of the infantry and auxiliary foot they were overtaken by the legions The consequence was not a fight but a carnage as of cattle until at length the general him self setting the example of a flight made his escape to the adjacent hills with about six thousand men half armed the rest were either slain or taken prisoners The Carthaginians hastily fortified an irregular camp on the highest part of the ground and defended them selves there without difficulty the enemy in vain at tempting to climb so difficult an ascent But a block ade in a place naked and destitute was hardly to be supported even for a few days desertions to the Ro man therefore were frequent Hasdrubal having at length procured some ships and the sea being not far distant left his army in the night and fled to Gades When Scipio was informed of the flight of the general leaving ten thousand foot and one thousand horse with Silanus for the blockade of the camp he returned him self with the rest of the forces to Tarraco where he arrived after a march of seventy days during which he was employed in examining into the conduct of the petty princes and states in order that their rewards might be proportioned according to a just estimate of their merits After his departure Masinissa having held a private conference with Silanus passed over with a few of his countrymen into Africa in order to bring his own nation to participate in the design which be had newly formed The cause of his sudden change HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXVIII 113 was not at that time well known but the inviolable fidelity which he ever afterwards preserved towards Rome through the whole course of a very long life is sufficient proof that he did not even then act without a reasonable motive Mago went to Gades in the ships which had been sent back by Hasdrubal Of the rest thus abandoned by their generals some deserted others fled and dispersed through the neighboring states no detachment remaining considerable either for number or strength These were the principal events in consequence of which under the conduct and auspices of Publius Scipio the Carthaginians were compelled to relinquish all footing in Spain in the thirteenth year from the commencement of hostili ties the fifth from Scipio s having received the com mand of the province and of the army Not long after Silanus returned to Scipio at Tarraco with in formation that the war was at an end 17 Lucius Scipio was employed in conveying to Rome a great many prisoners of distinction and in carrying the news of the reduction of Spain While this was considered by all others as a most joyful and glorious event he alone by whose means it had been accomplished insatiable in his pursuit of glory con sidered it as a trifle in comparison with those designs which his aspiring mind and sanguine hopes prompted him to conceive He now directed his views to Africa regarding the subjugation of Carthage in all her grandeur as the consummation of his renown Deem ing it necessary therefore to conciliate the friendship of the several African kings and people he resolved to make the first trial of Syphax king of the Massaesy lians â a nation bordering on Mauritania and lying opposite to that part of Spain particularly where New Carthage stands There was an alliance at that time subsisting between this monarch and the Carthaginians Supposing him however not more firmly attached than barbarians usually are whose fidelity always depends on fortune Scipio despatched Laelius to him as envoy with proper presents Syphax highly delighted with LIV VOL V H 114 LtVY these and considering that the Romans were at that time every where successful the Carthaginians un fortunate in Italy and quite excluded from Spain consented to embrace the friendship of the Romans but refused to exchange the ratification of the treaty except with the Roman general in person Lfelius then returned to Scipio having obtained from the king an engagement merely of safe conduct for him To him who aimed at conquests in Africa the friendship of Syphax was in every respect of the utmost im portance he was the most powerful prince in that part of the world had already opposed even the Car thaginians in war while his dominions lay very con veniently with respect to Spain from which they are separated by a narrow strait Scipio thought the affair of such moment as to warrant the attempt though at tended with considerable danger since otherwise it could not be accomplished Leaving therefore for the security of Spain Lucius Marcius at Tarraco and Marcus Silanus at New Carthage to which place he himself had made a hasty journey by land and setting sail from Carthage with Cains Liclius in two galleys of five banks he passed over to Africa while the sea was so calm that they generally used their oars though sometimes they were assisted by a gentle breeze It happened that Hasdrubal at the very same time after having been driven out of Spain had en tered the harbor with seven galleys of three banks and having cast anchor was mooring his ships On sight of these two five banked ships although no one doubted that they belonged to the Romans and might be overpowered by superior numbers before they en tered the harbor yet nothing ensued except tumult and confusion among the soldiers and sailors endeavor ing to no purpose to get their arms and ships in readi ness for the quinqueremes having their sails filled by a brisk gale from the sea were carried into the harbor before the Carthaginians could weigh their anchors and afterwards they dared not to raise a dis turbance in the king s port Having landed therefore HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXVIII 115 they proceeded Hasdrubal first then Scipio and Las lius on their way to the king 18 Syphax considered this as a very honorable cir cumstance as it really was that the generals of the two most powerful states of the age should come on the same day to solicit peace and friendship with him He invited them both to his palace and as chance had so ordered that they were under the same roof and in the protection of the same household gods he en deavored to bring them to a conference for the pur pose of putting an end to the enmity subsisting be tween them Scipio declared that in his private ca pacity he had not the least ill will to the Carthaginian which might require a conference to remove it and with regard to public affairs he could not enter into any negotiation with an enemy without orders from the senate However the king showing an earnest desire that he should come to the same table so that neither of his guests might seem to be excluded he did not refuse  and they there supped together Scipio and Hasdrubal perceiving that it would be agreeable to their entertainer even reclined on the same couch during the repast and so pleasing were the manners of the former such his pliability on every occasion and such his engaging conversation that he acquired the esteem not only of Syphax a barbarian unacquainted with Roman habits but even of his inveterate enemy who declared publicly that  he appeared on acquaint ance more worthy of admiration for his powers in conversation than for his exploits in war that he made no doubt but Syphax and his kingdom would soon be under the direction of the Romans Such ad dress was that man possessed of in acquiring an as cendancy over people s minds that the Carthaginians were not more intent at present in inquiring how Spain had been lost than how they were to retain possession of Africa That it was not for the sake of travelling or in the pursuit of pleasure that so great a general quitting a province but lately subdued and leaving his armies had passed over into Africa with only two 116 LIVY ships intrusting himself in an enemy s country to the power of the king and to his fidelity as yet untried Scipio had formed the scheme of subduing their peo ple had long entertained this design and had openly expressed his regret that he was not carrying on war in Africa as Hannibal was in Italy The league how ever being ratified with Syphax Scipio set sail and after being tossed a good deal during the voyage by variable and generally boisterous winds he made the harbor of New Carthage on the fourth day 19 As Spain had now rest from the Carthaginian war so it was manifest that some states remained quiet rather through fear arising from the conscious ness of misbehavior than through sincere attachment The most remarkable of these both in greatness and in guilt were Illiturgi and Castulo The inhabitants of Castulo allies of the Romans while they were suc cessful had on the destruction of the first Scipios and their armies revolted to the Carthaginians Those of Illiturgi by betraying and killing such as had fled to them after that calamity had added barbarity to re volt To have executed severe vengeance on those states at Scipio s first coming when affairs in Spain were in a precarious state would have been more suited to their demerits than agreeable to principles of sound policy but now when affairs were in a state of tranquillity the proper time for inflicting punish ment seemed to have arrived He therefore sent for Lucius Marcius from Tarraco and despatching him with a third part of the forces to besiege Castulo he went himself with the rest of the army against Illi turgi where he arrived on the fifth day The gates there had been already shut and every precaution taken and preparation made for repelling an attack so far had their consciousness of what they merited served them instead of a declaration of war Hence Scipio took occasion to represent in an exhortation to his soldiers  that the Spaniards themselves by shut ting their gates had shown what in justice they had reason to apprehend that they ought therefore to HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXVIII 117 entertain a much greater animosity against them than against the Carthaginians for with the latter the contest was for empire and glory almost without re sentment but the former they were called on to punish both for perfidy and cruelty That the time was now come when they were to take vengeance for the hor rid murder of their fellow soldiers and for the trea chery ready to be executed on themselves also had they happened to fly to the same place and by a se vere example to establish it as a maxim to all future ages that no Roman citizen or soldier in any state of fortune should be injured with impunity Their rage being excited by this harangue they distributed the scaling ladders to chosen men in each company and the army being divided into two parts one of which Laelius lieutenant general was to command they as saulted the city in two places at once striking terror into the assailed by the twofold danger to which they were exposed It was not one leader or a number of chiefs but their own violent apprehensions in conse quence of their guilt that induced the inhabitants to make a vigorous defence they were fully sensible and they reminded each other that  their punishment not a victory was the object aimed at that the mat ter for present consideration was where they should choose to meet death whether in the field and in fight where the chance of war equal to both parties often raises the vanquished and pulls down the conqueror or whether after seeing their city burned and demo lished and after suffering every indignity and dis grace they should expire among chains and stripes in the presence of their captive wives and children Therefore not only those who were of an age to bear arms or the men alone but women and boys added exertions beyond the strength of their minds or bodies supplying with weapons those who were engaged in the fight and carrying stones to the walls for others who were strengthening the works for beside that their liberty was at stake and by which the brave are powerfully excited the1 extreme severity of punish 118 LIVY ment which they must all expect with a disgraceful death were before their eyes Farther their courage was inflamed by mutual emulation in toil and danger and even by the sight of each other Thus animated they opposed the enemy with such determined bravery that the army which had subdued all Spain was often repulsed from the walls and began in a contest with the youth of a single town not much to their honor to abate of their ardor Scipio perceiving this and dreading lest by these unsuccessful attempts the cou rage of the enemy should be raised and his own men dispirited thought it necessary to exert himself in person and take a share in the danger Whereon reprimanding the troops for their want of spirit he ordered ladders to be brought to him threatening to mount the wall himself since the rest were backward and accordingly he had already advanced near it and not without danger when a shout was raised on all sides by the soldiers alarmed at the situation of the general and the scalade was attempted at once Laslius too pressed on at the other side The inha bitants were then no longer able to make opposition and those who defended the walls being beaten off the Romans took possession of them 20 The citadel too during the tumult being at tacked on that side where it was thought impregnable was taken While the inhabitants were engaged in defence of those places where the danger appeared and the Romans in making greater approaches where they found it practicable some African deserters who were then among the Roman auxiliaries observed that the most elevated part of the town though pro tected by a very high rock was neither secured by any works nor provided with men for its defence As they were light of body and very active from constant exercise carrying iron spears along with them they climbed up by means of the irregular prominences of the rock and when they met with a cliff too high and smooth by driving in the spikes at moderate distances they formed a kind of steps In this manner the fore HISTORY OF ROME BOOK XXVIII 119 most drawing up by the hand those who followed and the hindmost lifting up those before them they made their way to the summit and from thence with loud shouts poured down into the city which had been already taken by the Romans Then it plainly ap peared that resentment and hatred had been the mo tives of the assault no one thought of taking pri soners no one thought of booty though the objects lay before their eyes The armed and unarmed were slain without distinction women and men promiscu ously the cruel rage of the soldiers proceeded even to slaying of infants They then set fire to the houses and what could not be thus destroyed they levelled to the ground so earnest were they to erase every trace of the city and to abolish every mark of the enemy s residence Scipio from thence led his army to Cas tulo which was defended by a great concourse of Spa niards and also by the remains of the Carthaginian army collected from the places whither they had dis persed in their flight But the news of the calamities of the Illiturgians had preceded the arrival of Scipio and thrown the garrison into fright and despair and as they were differently circumstanced while each party wished to provide for their own safety without regard to the rest at first silent suspicion afterward s open discord ensued and caused a separation between the Carthaginians and Spaniards Cerdubellus openly advised the latter to surrender Himilco commanded the Carthaginian garrison auxiliaries who together with the city were delivered up to the Romans by Cerdubellus after he had privately made terms for himself This victory was not followed with so much severity the guilt of this people not having been so great as that of the former and their voluntary sur render mitigating in some degree the resentment against them 21 Marcius proceeded from thence in order to re duce to obedience such of the barbarians as had not been completely subdued Scipio returned to New Carthage in order to pay his vows to the gods and to 120 UVY exhibit a show of gladiators which he had prepared in commemoration of the death of his father and uncle The combatants exhibited on this occasion were not of that sort which the lanistae are wont to procure a col lection of slaves or such free men as are base enough to set their blood to sale Every champion here gave his service voluntarily and without reward for some were sent by the princes of the country to show a spe cimen of the bravery natural to their nation some declared that they would fight to oblige the general some were led by emulation and a desire of supe riority to send challenges and those who were chal lenged from the same motive did not decline them some decided by the sword controversies which they could not or would not determine by arbitration having agreed between themselves that the matter in dispute should be the property of the conqueror Not only people of obscure condition but men of charac ter and distinction Corbis and Orsua for instance cousins german having a dispute about the sove reignty of a city called Ibis determined to decide it with the sword Corbis had the advantage in regard to years The father of Orsua however had been last on the throne having succeeded to it on the death of his elder brother Scipio endeavored to accommodate the matter by calm discussion and to assuage their resentment but they both affirmed that they had re fused to submit it to their common relations and that they would have no other judge neither god nor man but Mars They severally preferred death in fight to a submission to the other s authority the elder confi dent in his strength the younger in his activity and so determined was their rage that it was impossible to reconcile them They afforded an extraordinary spec tacle to the army and a striking example of the evils oc casioned by ambition The elder by experience in arms and superior skill easily vanquished the ill managed valor of the younger To this exhibition of gladiators were added funeral games conducted with as much mag nificence as the province and the camp could supply HISTORY OF ROME BOOK XXVIII 121 22 While Scipio was thus employed operations were carried on by his lieutenant Marcius who hav ing passed the river Baetis which the natives call Cer tis got possession of two wealthy cities by surrender without a contest There was another called Astapa which had always taken part with the Carthaginians but that circumstance did not so much call for resent ment as from their having acted towards the Romans with an extraordinary degree of animosity beyond what the exigences of the war could warrant This was the more surprising as they had no city so se cured either by situation or fortification as that it might encourage such fierceness of temper but the disposition of the inhabitants delighting in plunder led them to make incursions into the neighboring lands belonging to the allies of the Roman people and even to seize on small parties of soldiers together with the sutlers and traders A large detachment also which was attempting to pass through their territory was surrounded by an ambuscade and put to death in a place where they could not defend themselves As soon as the army approached to besiege the city the inhabitants conscious of their crimes saw no prospect of safety in surrendering to a people so highly pro voked and as their fortifications were in such a state that they could not greatly hope to defend themselves by arms they contrived a plan of the most shocking and savage nature which they agreed to execute on themselves and their families They fixed on a part of the forum into which they brought together all their most valuable effects and having made their wives and children seat themselves on this heap they piled up timber all round it and threw on it abundance of faggots They then gave a charge to fifty young men in arms that  as long as the issue of the fight should be uncertain they should carefully guard in that spot the fortunes of all and the persons of those who were dearer to them than their fortunes Should they per ceive that their friends were worsted and that the city was likely to be taken that then they might be 122 LIVY assured that every one whom they saw going out to battle would meet death in the engagement They then besought them by the deities celestial and infer nal that mindful of their liberty which must termi nate on that day either in an honorable death or dis graceful slavery they would leave no object on which the enraged enemy could vent their fury That they had fire and swords at their command and that it were better that their friendly and faithful hands should consume those things which must necessarily perish than that the foe should insult over them with haughty scorn To these exhortations they added dreadful imprecations against any who should be di verted from their purpose either by hope or tender ness and then with rapid speed and violent impe tuosity they rushed out through the open gates There was none of the outposts strong enough to withstand them because nothing could have been less appre hended than that they should dare to come out of the fortifications a very few troops of horse and the light infantry despatched in haste from the camp threw themselves in their way The encounter was furious owing more to their impetuosity and resolu tion than to any regular disposition The horse there fore which had first engaged being discomfited com municated the terror to the light infantry and the battle would have reached to the very rampart had not the main body of the legions drawn out their line though there was very little time allowed them for forming Even among their battalions there was some confusion while the Astapans blinded with fury rushed on against men and weapons with the most daring insensibility of danger But in a short time the veteran soldiers too steady to be disturbed by such rash attacks by killing the foremost stopped the advance of the next Afterwards when they endea vored to gain on them finding that not a man gave way but that they were obstinately determined to die they extended their line which their numbers enabled them to do with ease they then surrounded the flanks HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXVIII 123 of these desperates who forming into a circle and continuing the fight were slain to a man 23 This severity executed by an enraged enemy on those who opposed them in arms especially as they were at the time engaged in hostilities with another people was not inconsistent with the laws of war But the more shocking havoc was in the city where a weak unarmed crowd of women and children were assailed by their own countrymen who tossed their almost lifeless bodies on the burning pile while streams of blood kept down the rising flames and who at last wearied with the wretched slaughter of their friends cast themselves with their arms into the midst of the fire Just as the carnage was completed the victorious Romans arrived On the first sight of such a horrid transaction they were for a time struck motionless with astonishment hut afterwards on seeing the gold and silver glittering between the heaps of other mat ters with the greediness natural to mankind they wished to snatch them out of the burning heap In attempting this some were caught by the flames others scorched by blasts of the heat the foremost finding it impracticable to make a retreat against the press of so great a crowd Thus was Astapa utterly destroyed by fire and sword and without enriching the soldiers with booty All the other inhabitants of that district terrified at this event made their submissions Marcius led back his victorious army to join Scipio at Carthage Just at the same time some deserters arrived from Gades who promised to deliver up the city the Carthaginian garrison and the commander of the garrison together with the fleet Mago had halted there after his flight and haVing collected a few ships from the ocean adjoining and with the assistance of Hanno his lieutenant assembled others from the near est parts of Spain had brought some supplies from the coast of Africa Terms being adjusted with the deserters and ratified on both sides Marcius was despatched thither with some cohorts equipped for ex pedition and Laelius also with seven three banked 124 LIVY and one five banked galley that they might act in con cert both by land and sea in the execution of the busi ness 24 Scipio was seized with a severe fit of sickness and the danger being magnified by report every one through the natural propensity to exaggeration add ing something to what he had heard the whole pro vince more especially the distant parts of it were thrown into disorder which showed what important consequences must have attended the real loss of him when the rumor of his illness alone could excite such storms Neither the allies continued faithful nor the army obedient to command Mandonius and Indibilis who had entertained confident expectations that on the expulsion of the Carthaginians the dominion of Spain would fall into their hands being intirely disappointed in all their hopes called together their countrymen of Laceta and Illiturgi sent for the young men of Celti beria to assist them and carried hostilities and devas tation into the territories of the Suessetanians and Se detanians allies of the Roman people Another com motion arose in the camp at Sucro where there were eight thousand Romans stationed to secure the obedi ence of the nations bordering on the Iberus Their disposition to mutiny did not take its rise from the un certain accounts of the general s life being in danger it had sprung up some time before from the licentious ness incident to a long state of inaction and partly from their circumstances being straitened during peace having been accustomed during the war to live more plentifully on plunder At first they only expressed their dissatisfaction in private discourses If there was a war in the province what business had they there among people who were at peace If the war was already ended why were they not carried back to Italy They also demanded their pay with a peremp toriness unbecoming the condition of soldiers while those on guard used to throw out abuse on the tribunes as they went their nightly rounds Favored by the darkness some bad even gone out and plundered the HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXVIII 125 peaceable country round and at length they used to quit their standards without leave openly and in the day time In a word every thing was directed by the licentious humor of the soldiery nothing by the rules and discipline of war or the commands of the officers The form however of a Roman camp was preserved merely on account of the hope which they entertained that the tribunes would be infected with their madness and become sharers in their mutiny and revolt They therefore permitted them to hold their courts at the tribunals they applied to them for the watchword and mounted guards and watches in their turn  and as they had taken away all the power of command so by submitting from choice to the usual duties they kept up the appearance of obedience to orders But when they found that the tribunes disapproved and blamed their proceedings that they endeavored to put a stop to them and openly refused to assist in their designs the mutiny then burst out and having by violence driven the tribunes from their stands and soon after from the camp with the unanimous approbation of the whole body they bestowed the supreme command on Caius Albius of Cales and Caius Atrius of Umbria common soldiers who were the principal movers of the sedition These men not satisfied with the orna ments used by tribunes had the assurance to lay hold of the badges of supreme command the rods and axes never considering that their own backs and necks were in danger from those very rods and axes which they carried before them to strike terror into others Their groundless belief of Scipio s death blinded their under standings and they entertained not a doubt that on the news of that event which would soon be generally known the ffames of war would break out in every part of Spain  that during this confusion money might be exacted from the allies and the neighboring cities plundered and that the disturbances being general and all men acting without restraint their own beha vior would be the less liable to observation â 2d No accounts of the death of Scipio being ret 120 LIVY ceived the rumor which had been inconsiderately pro pagated began to die away They then began to in quire for the first authors of it but every one threw it off from himself that he might appear rather to have believed rashly than to have been the contriver of the fiction The leaders now forsaken began to dread even their own badges of office and considered with terror the real and just authority which was about to take place of the empty show of command which they possessed and which would doubtless be exerted to their destruction While the mutiny was at a stand through the amazement of the soldiers on receiving undoubted intelligence first that Scipio was alive and afterwards that he was in good health seven military tribunes despatched by himself arrived in the camp On their coming the mutineers were at first exaspe rated but they were soon softened by the mild and soothing language in which these addressed such of their acquaintances as they met for at first going round the tents and then in the public tribunals and in the pretorium wherever they observed circles of soldiers engaged in conversation they accosted them in such a manner as carried the appearance rather of an inquiry into the cause of their resentment and sud den disorder than of throwing any blame on what had passed The reasons generally alleged were that  they had not received their pay regularly although at the time of the horrid transaction at Illiturgi and after the utter destruction of the two generals and their two armies it was by their bravery that the Roman name had been supported and the province secured that the people of Illiturgi had indeed met with the punish ment due to their guilt but their meritorious conduct had remained unrewarded The tribunes answered that in these remonstrances their requests were founded in justice and should be laid before the gene ral that they were highly pleased to find that there was nothing in their case more grievous or incurable and that by the favor of the gods they had both Pub lius Scipio and the state to reward their merit Sci HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXVIII 127 pio well practised in wars but utterly unacquainted with the storms of intestine commotions was filled with anxiety on the occasion fearing lest the army should exceed all bounds in transgressing or himself in pu nishing For the present he resolved to proceed as he had begun by gentle measures having therefore despatched collectors through the tributary states he received reason to hope to be soon able to discharge the arrears An order was then published that the troops should come to Carthage to receive their pay either in separate divisions or in one body as they should choose The mutiny of itself abating in vio lence among the Romans was reduced to a state of perfect tranquillity by the measures which the rebel lious Spaniards suddenly adopted Mandonius and Indibilis on receiving information that Scipio was alive desisted from their undertaking and returned into their own country as there was now remaining neither countrymen nor foreigner to whom they could look up for a concurrence in their desperate scheme The soldiers after revolving every plan were of opi nion that they had nothing left except what is not always the safest retreat from bad counsels the sub mitting themselves either to the just anger of the ge neral or to his clemency of which it was thought they need not despair He had pardoned even enemies with whom he had been engaged in battle their mu tiny had not been attended with any serious conse quences no lives had been lost nor had any blood been shed therefore as it had not in itself been vio lent it merited not a violent punishment Men s minds are generally ingenious in palliating guilt in themselves They only hesitated then whether they should go and demand their pay in single cohorts or in a body The majority voted that as the safer way they should proceed in a body 26 Whilst they were employed in these delibera tions a council was held at Carthage concerning them the members of which were divided in opinion whether the authors only of the mutiny who were not more LIVY than thirty five should be punished or whether it was not necessary that what ought to be called a revolt rather than a mutiny and afforded such a dangerous example should be expiated by the punishment of a greater number The milder opinion prevailed that the punishment should be confined to those who were the instigators to it and that for the multitude a re primand was sufficient As soon as the council was dismissed orders were issued to the army which was in Carthage to prepare for an expedition against Man donius and Indibilis and to get ready provisions for several days in order that people might think that this had been the business of the meeting Then the seven tribunes who had before gone to Sucro to quell the disturbance were again sent out to gather farther information on the matter when each of them made a return of five names of the leaders of it with the in tent that proper persons appointed for the purpose should invite these with friendly countenance and dis course to their lodgings and that there when stupi fied with wine they might be secured in chains When they came near Carthage they heard from some per sons on the road that the whole army was to set out next day with Marcus Silanus against the Laceta nians which not only freed the disaffected from the apprehensions which though concealed lay heavy on their minds but occasioned great joy amongst them as they supposed that the general would be left alone in their power instead of their being in his A little before sunset they entered the city and saw the other army busy in preparations for a march they were re ceived with discourses framed for the purpose that  their coming was highly agreeable and convenient to the general as it had happened just before the departure of the other army after which they retired to refresh themselves The authors of the mutiny having been conducted to lodgings by the persons appointed were without any tumult apprehended by the tribunes and thrown into chains At the fourth watch the baggage of that army which as pretended was to march began HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXVIII 12i to set out A little before day the troops moved also but stopped in a body at the gate whence guards were sent round to all the other avenues to prevent any one going out of the city Those who had arrived the day before were then summoned to an assembly and they ran together into the forum to the general s tribunal in the most turbulent manner intending to excite terror by their tumultuous shouts Just as the general was taking his seat the troops who had been recalled from the gates spread themselves round under arms be hind the unarmed assembly On this all the arrogance of the latter sunk at once and as they afterwards confessed nothing terrified them so much as the unex pected vigor and complexion of the general whom they ha d expected to see in a sickly stateâ his counte nance showing more sternness they said than they had ever remembered to have seen even in battle He sat silent for a short time until he was told that the authors of the mutiny were brought into the forum and that all things were prepared 27 Then a herald having commanded silence he began thus Never did I imagine that I should be in want of language to address my own army not that I ever gave more attention to words than to business for having lived in camps almost from my childhood I was ever well acquainted with the soldier s way of think ing But with what sentiments or in what terms I should speak to you I am intirely at a loss I know not even what appellation I ought to give you Can I call you countrymen who have revolted from your country or soldiers who have renounced obedience to command and broke through the obligation of your oath or enemies I behold indeed the per sons faces habit mien of my fellow citizens but I perceive the actions words schemes dispositions of foes for what other object did your hopes and wishes aim at than the same which was proposed by the Illergetians and Lacetans They however chose for leaders in their mad enterprise Mandonius and Indi bilis men of royal distinction you conferred su LIV VOL V I 130 LIVY preme authority and command on the Umbrian Atrins and the Calenian Albius Soldiers deny that it was the act of you all or that you all approved of it assert that it was the madness and folly of a few I shall willingly give credit to your disavowal for the crimes committed are of such a nature that did the guilt of them extend to the whole army it could not be expiated without very extraordinary atonements I unwillingly touch those matters as I should wounds but unless such are touched and handled they cannot be cured After the Carthaginians were expelled from Spain I really believed that there was not in the whole province any one place or any description of men to whom my life was not a matter of concern  such had been my conduct not only towards the allies but even towards the enemy And yet even in my own camp so much was I deceived in my opinion the re port of my death was not only readily believed but longed for Not that I wish this behavior should be imputed to you all I assure you if I could believe that my whole army wished my death I would here this instant die before your eyes nor could life afford me any pleasure if it were displeasing to my country men and soldiers But every multitude like the sea is incapable of moving itself the winds and gales put it in motion thus when either calms or storms appear in you all the madness lies in the first advisers This you have caught by infection and even this day you do not seem to me to be sensible to what a pitch of folly you have proceeded or how heinous your at tempts have been with respect to me how heinous with respect to your country your parents and your children how heinous with respect to the gods who were witnesses of your oath how heinous against the practice of the service the discipline of your an cestors and the majesty of the supreme authority and rule With regard to myself I say nothing Be it that you believed the report rather through want of thought than through a wish that it should be true and let me even be supposed such a person that it HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXVIII 131 were no wonder if the army were weary of my com mand yet what had your country deserved of you that by uniting your counsels with Mandonius and In dibilis you were going to betray it What had the Roman people merited when you took away the power from the tribunes appointed by their common suffrage and conferred it on private men when not even content with having them for magistrates you a Roman army bestowed the badges of your generals on men who never had been possessed of so much as a single slave Albius and Atrius dwelt in the general s pavilion the trumpets sounded by their orders the word was taken from them they sat on the tribunal of Publius Scipio they were attended by lictors the way was cleared for them the rods and axes were carried before them That it should rain stones that light nings should be darted from heaven and that animals should produce monstrous births you look on as pro digies This is a prodigy that can be expiated by no victims by no supplications without the blood of those who dared to commit such enormous crimes 28 Now although no wickedness proceeds on any grounds of reason yet in a transaction of such atrocity as this I should be glad to know what was your intention what your scheme Formerly a le gion which had been sent as a garrison to Rhegium wickedly put to death the principal inhabitants and kept possession of that opulent city for ten years for which offence the whole legion four thousand men were beheaded in the forum at Rome These how ever did not put themselves under the command of an Atrius a man no better than a scullion whose very name was ominous but of Decius Jubellius a mili tary tribune nor did they join themselves to the ene mies of the Roman people either to the Samnites or Lncanians You united in counsels with Mandonius and Indibilis with whom you intended to have united also your arms Besides those men expected to hold Rhegium as a lasting settlement as the Campaniam held Capua after taking it from the ancient Tuscan 132 LIVY inhabitants and as the Mamertines held Messana in Sicily â never entertaining a thought of making war on the Roman people or their allies Did you intend to settle your habitations at Sucro a place in which if I your general at my departure after finishing the business of the province had left you and there to remain you ought to have appealed to gods and men on not being allowed to return to your wives and chil dren But supposing that you had banished out of your minds all recollection of them as you did of your country and of me let us examine what could be your design and whether it can be accounted for on the supposition of a depravity of principle without in cluding also the utmost degree of folly While I was alive and the other part of the army safe with which I took Carthage in one day with which I vanquished put to flight and drove out of Spain four generals with four armies of the Carthaginians could you ex pect that you who were but eight thousand men all of you of course inferior in worth to Albius and At rius since to their command you submitted your selves â could you imagine I say that you should be able to wrest the province of Spain out of the hands of the Roman people I lay no stress on my own name I put it out of the question supposing my self no farther ill treated than in your easily and joy fully giving credit to the report of my death What If I were dead was the state to expire along with me was the empire of the Roman people to fall with Scipio Jove supremely great and good forbid that the city built for eternity under the favor and direc tion of the gods should last no longer than this frail and mortal body Although so many illustrious com manders Flaminius Paulus Gracchus Posthumius Albinus Marcus Marcellus Titus Quintius Crispinus Cneius Fulvius my relations the Scipios have all been lost in one war yet the Roman people still sur vive and will survive whilst a thousand others perish some by the sword some by disease and must the Roman state have been carried out to burial along HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXVIII 133 with my single body You yourselves here in Spain when my father and uncle your two generals were slain chose Septimus Marcius your leader against the Carthaginians exulting in their late victory I men tion this as if Spain would have been without a leader but would Marcus Silanus who was sent into the pro vince invested with the same privileges the same command with myself would my brother Lucius Sci pio and Caius Laelius lieutenants general be wanting to avenge the majesty of the empire Could either the armies or the leaders or their dignity or their cause admit of a comparison And even if you were superior to all these would you bear arms on the side of the Carthaginians against your country against your countrymen Would you wish that Africa should rule over Italy Carthage over the city of Rome And for what fault I would ask of your na tion 29  Coriolanus provoked by a grievous and unde served banishment to take up arms against his oppres sors yielded however to the call of duty to a parent and refrained from committing parricide on his country What grief what anger had incited you Was the delay of your pay for a few days and while your ge neral was sick sufficient reason for declaring war against your native land to revolt from the Roman people to the Illergetians to leave no obligation di vine or human unviolated Soldiers the truth is you have been mad nor was the disorder which seized my body more violent than that which seized your minds It shocks me to mention what such men believed what they hoped what they wished But let all those matters be buried in oblivion if possible if not let them however be covered in silence I doubt not but my language may appear to you severe and harsh yet how much more harsh your actions than my words Do you think it reasonable that I should bear the facts which you have committed and that you should not have patience to hear them men tioned But even with these things you shall be re 134 LIVY proached no farther I wish you may as easily forget them as I shall Therefore as to what concerns you all in general if you are sorry for your error I am fully satisfied with the expiation The Calenian Al bius the Umbrian Atrius and the other authors of that abominable mutiny shall atone with their blood for the crime of which they have been guilty and if you have recovered your sound judgment the sight of their punishment will not only be not disagreeable but even pleasing to you for the tendency of their schemes was as pernicious and destructive to your selves as to any other persons whatsoever Scarcely had he finished his speech when according to a plan preconcerted their eyes and ears were at once assailed by every object of terror The troops which had formed a circle round the assembly clashed their swords against their shields the herald s voice was heard citing by name those who had been condemned in the council they were dragged naked into the midst and at the same time all the apparatus for death was produced they were chained to the stake beaten with rods and beheaded the spectators all the while standing so benumbed with fear that not only no violent expression against the severity of the pu nishment but not even a groan was heard They were then all dragged out the place was cleared and their fellows being summoned by their names took the oath of obedience to Scipio before the tribunes of the soldiers at the same time receiving their pay Such was the end and issue of the rising which began at Sucro 30 About the same time Hanno Mago s lieutenant having been sent from Gades with a small body of Africans had by tempting the Spaniards with money collected four thousand young men in arms near the river Bsetis but being afterwards beaten out of his camp by Lucius Marcius and having lost the greatest part of his forces in the tumult and others also in the flight his disordered troops having been pursued by the cavalry he made his escape with very few at HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXVIII 135 tendants During these transactions on the Baetis Laelius sailing through the strait came with the fleet to Carteja a city situated on the coast and where the sea begins to expand itself There had been hopes of gaining possession of Gades without a contest by means of a conspiracy of the inhabitants some of whom came of their own accord to the Roman camp with promises to that effect as has been mentioned before but the plot was discovered before it was ripe and Mago having seized all the conspirators gave them in charge to Adherbal the pretor to be con ducted to Carthage Adherbal put them on board a ship of five banks and sending it off before him be cause it sailed slower than any one of three banks followed himself at a small distance with eight three banked vessels The quinquereme was justenteringthe strait when Laelius who had sailed in a quinquereme also from the harbor of Carteja attended by seven triremes bore down on Adherbal and the triremes taking for granted that the quinquereme once caught in the rapid current of the narrow pass would not be able to tack about The Carthaginian alarmed by this unexpected affair hesitated for some time whether he should follow the quinquereme or face the enemy This delay put it out of his power to avoid an engage ment for they were already within a weapon s cast and the Roman pressing him closely on all sides The force of the stream too had rendered it impossible to manage their ships nor was the fight like a naval en gagement for nothing was effected either by skill or prudence The tide indeed might be said to have the intire command for it bore them down sometimes on their own sometimes on the Roman vessels while they were endeavoring in vain to row in a contrary direction so that a ship which was flying might be seen whirled round by an eddy and carried full against the conqueror while another engaged in pur suit if it happened to fall into a contrary current would be turned about as if for flight Thus one ship aiming a violent stroke of its beak against the hull of 136 LIVY the enemy being carried itself in an oblique direction received a blow from the beak of that it had strove to pierce while that which lay with its side exposed to the assailant was suddenly whirled round so as to present its prow to them While the battle between the triremes was thus doubtful and irregular being governed intirely by chance the Roman quinquereme more manageable either from being steadier on ac count of its great weight or from making its way through the eddies by its superior number of rowers sunk two triremes and brushing along close by a third swept off the oars on the one side handling roughly some others which it had overtaken but Adherbal crowded sail and with the five remaining ships escaped to Africa 31 Laelius returning victorious to Carteja and hav ing learned there what had passed at Gades that the plot had been discovered the conspirators sent to Carthage and the hopes which had invited them thi ther intirely frustrated he sent to acquaint Lucius Marcius that he was of opinion that they ought to re turn to the general unless they chose to waste time to no purpose lying before Gades Marcius assenting they both returned to Carthage A few days after by their departure Mago not only gained a respite from the dangers which had environed him both by sea and land but on hearing of the rebellion of the Illergetians he even conceived hopes of recovering Spain He sent messengers to the senate at Carthage with instructions to exaggerate both the intestine dis sension in the Roman camp and the defection of the allies and to exhort them to send such supplies as should enable him to recover the empire of Spain which had been transmitted to them by their ances tors Mandonius and Indibilis returning into their own territories kept themselves quiet for some time not knowing what to determine until they could learn what measures were taken with regard to the mutiny for if pardon were granted by Scipio to his country men they did not doubt but that it would extend to HISTORY OF ROME BOOK XXVIII 137 themselves But when the punishment of the of fenders came to be known supposing that their own crime would be thought to demand an equal atone ment they called their countrymen to arms and re assembling the auxiliaries which had joined them be fore they marched out with twenty thousand foot and two thousand five hundred horse into the territory of Sedeta where at the beginning of the revolt they had established a camp 32 Scipio quickly conciliated the affections of his men by his punctuality in discharging all arrears to the guilty as well as to the innocent and which was strengthened by the mildness of his discourse and the benignity of his countenance towards all without dis tinction Summoning an assembly on his departure from Carthage after copious invectives against the perfidy of the petty princes then in rebellion he de clared that  he was setting out to take vengeance for their crimes with feelings very different from those which he had lately experienced while he was apply ing a remedy to the error of his countrymen that then he had with grief and tears as if cutting his own bowels expiated either the imprudence or the guilt of eight thousand men by the death of thirty  but now he was proceeding with cheerfulness and confidence to the destruction of the Illergetians for these were neither born in the same land nor connected with him by any bond of society  and for the only connexion which had subsisted that of good faith and friendship they had wickedly rent it asunder That there was one circum stance respecting his army which gave him great satis faction which was their being all either of his own country allies or of the Latine confederacy that there was scarcely a single soldier in it who had not been brought thither from Italy either by his uncle Cneius Scipio the first of the Roman name who entered that province or by his father in his consulate or by him self that they were all accustomed to the name and authority of the Scipios that he wished to carry them home with him to a well deserved triumph and that 138 LIVY he entertained confident hopes that they would support his claim to the consulship as if they were every one of them to share the honor of it That as to the expe dition before them that man must have forgotten his own exploits who could consider it as a war for his part he was really more concerned about Mago who had fled with a few ships beyond the limits of the world into a spot surrounded by the ocean than about the Illergetians for on that spot there was a Cartha ginian general and whatever forces might be there they were Carthaginians Here was only a band of robbers and leaders of robbers who though they might have courage sufficient for ravaging their neigh bors grounds burning their houses and seizing their cattle would show none in the field or in regular bat tle and who whenever they should see an enemy would rely more on their activity for flight than on their arms It was not therefore because he appre hended any danger from thence that he had determined to suppress the Illergetians before he left the province but principally that such a heinous revolt should not escape without punishment and also that it might not be said that there was one enemy left in a country which had been overrun with such bravery and suc cess He desired them therefore with the favor of the gods to follow him not to what could properly be called a war for the contest was not with a people on an equality wijh them but to inflict punishment on a set of criminals 33 After this discourse he dismissed them with orders to prepare for a decampment on the following morning After a march of ten days he arrived at the river Iberus which he passed and on the fourth day he pitched his camp within sight of the enemy There was a plain before him encircled by mountains into this valley Scipio ordered some cattle taken mostly from the surrounding lands to be driven forward in order to provoke the savage greediness of the bar barians sending with them some light armed troops as a guard and giving orders to Laelius that as soon HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXVIII 139 as these should be engaged in skirmishing he should charge with the cavalry from a place of concealment A conveniently projecting mountain covered the am bush of the cavalry and the battle began without de lay for the Spaniards rushed on the cattle as soon as they saw them at a distance and the light infantry attacked them occupied with their booty At first they endeavored to terrify each other with missive weapons afterwards having discharged their light darts which were fitter to provoke than to decide the fight they drew their swords and began to engage foot to foot The contest between the infantry was doubtful but the cavalry came up who charging straight forward not only trod down all before them but some also wheeling round along the foot of the steep fell on the enemy s rear inclosing the greater part of them so that the number slain was far more considerable than is usual in such kind of engagements This discomfiture served rather to inflame the rage of the barbarians than depress them In order therefore to show that they were not dispirited at the first light on the day following they led out their troops to battle The valley being narrow as has been mentioned could not contain all their forces so that only about two thirds of the infantry and all their cavalry came down to the engagement The remainder of the foot they posted on a hill on one side Scipio judging that the narrowness of the ground was a favorable circumstance to him both because fighting in a confined space seemed better suited to the Roman than the Spanish soldier and also because the enemy could not completely form their line turned his thoughts to a new scheme Find ing that he could not extend his cavalry on the wings and that those of the enemy whom they had brought out with the infantry would be useless he ordered Laelius to lead the cavalry round the hills by the most concealed roads and to keep separate as much as pos sible the fight of the cavalry from that between the in fantry He himself led forward the battalions of in fantry placing four cohorts in front for he could not 140 LIVY greatly extend his line and without delay began the engagement in order to divert the enemy s attention by the hurry of the conflict from Laelius detachment who were advancing from among the hills In this they succeeded for the Spaniards were unconscious of their coming until they heard the tumult of the fight between them and their own cavalry on the rear Thus there were two different battles two lines of foot and two bodies of horse were engaged along the extent of the plain the circumscribed ground not allowing them to be composed of both together On the side of the Spaniards as neither the foot could assist the horse nor the horse the foot the latter who had rashly ven tured into the plain relying on the support of their cavalry were cut to pieces and the cavalry being sur rounded could neither withstand the Roman infantry in front for by this time their own was intirely cut off nor the cavalry on their rear but having formed in a circle and defended themselves a long time with out changing their position they were all slain to a man Thus not one of those who were engaged in the valley either horse or foot survived the fight The third company which had stood on the hill rather to view the engagement securely than to take any part in it had both room and time to make their escape The two princes also fled with them during the tumult and before the army was intirely surrounded 34 The same day the camp of the Spaniards was taken together with about three thousand men be sides other booty Of the Romans and their allies there fell one thousand two hundred above three thousand were wounded The victory would have been less bloody if the battle had happened in a more extensive plain so as to have allowed the enemy an easy flight Indibilis renouncing his project of pro ceeding farther in the war and seeing no better pro spect of safety in this desperate state of his affairs than in the honor and clemency of Scipio which he had al ready experienced sent his brother Mandonius to him who prostrating himself at his feet lamented the HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXVIII 141 fatal frensy of the times wherein as it were through some pestilent contagion not only the Illergetians and Lacetanians but even the Roman camp had been in fected that the present state of himself his brother and the rest of his countrymen was such that if it was required they would surrender up to Scipio the life which he had spared to them  or if they might be still preserved they would ever devote it to his service for in such case they should be actually twice indebted to him alone for existence That in the former case they had confidence in their cause before they had made trial of his clemency but now on the contrary they could have none in their cause and their only hope lay in the mercy of their conqueror It was the practice of the Romans observed from very early times with respect to persons with whom they had formed no treaty of friendship or alliance never to exercise any act of authority over them for they were not held as subjects until they had surrendered all their property both sacred and common had given hostages delivered up their arms and received gar risons in their towns On the present occasion Scipio after severely reproaching Mandonius who was pre sent and Indibilis who was absent said that they had deservedly been brought to ruin by their own wicked practices that they should owe their lives to the generosity of himself and the Roman people Farther he would not even deprive them of their arms those were only to be taken as pledges by such as feared a renewal of war they should therefore be freely left them nor should their minds be shackled with fear Should they again revolt he would not take vengeance on guiltless hostages but on them selves he would inflict no punishment on defenceless enemies but on those who carried arms That he left it to themselves who had experienced both to choose the favor or the resentment of the Romans On these terms Mandonius was dismissed and they were only fined a sum of money for the pay of the troops Sci pio having sent on his lieutenant into Farther Spain 142 Ll VY and Silamis back to Tarraco delayed only a few days until the Illergetians had paid the fine demanded of them Then with some troops lightly equipped he followed Marcius whom he overtook at a small dis tance from the ocean 35 The negotiation some time before commenced with Masinissa had been delayed by various causes the Numidian choosing to confer only with Scipio him self and from his hand to receive the ratification of the compact This was Scipio s reason for undertaking at that time so long a journey and to places so distant from his quarters When Masinissa received notice at Gades from Marcius that he was drawing nigh com plaining that his horses were injured by being pent up in the island that they not only caused a scarcity of every thing among the men but felt it themselves and besides that the horsemen were losing their spirits through want of exercise he prevailed on Mago to allow him to pass over to the continent to plunder the adjacent country of the Spaniards On landing he sent forward three chiefs of the Nuniidians to fix a time and place for a conference desiring that two of them might be detained by Scipio as hostages and the third sent back to conduct him to the place appointed They came to the conference with but few attendants the Numidian had long been possessed with admiration of the man he was about to meet from the fame of his exploits and had formed a perfect idea of the grandeur and dignity of his person But on seeing him his veneration increased for the elegance of his appear ance naturally majestic was added to by his flowing hair and by his becoming dress not decorated with ornaments but in a style truly manly and military by his age also as he was in full vigor aided by the bloom of youth renewed as it were after his late ill ness At their meeting the Numidian struck with a degree of astonishment first  thanked him for having sent home his brother s son assured him that ever since the transaction he had sought for the present op portunity which being at length offered Ly the favor HISTORY OF ROME BOOK XXVIII 143 of the immortal gods he had not neglected that he wished to exert himself in his service and that of the Roman people with more zeal and effect than had ever been shown by any foreigner in support of the Roman interest that although this had long been his wish yet he was less able to effect it in Spain â a territory with which he was little acquainted but in bis own country in Africa where he had been born and educated with the hopes of enjoying the kingdom of his father it would he more easily in his power to serve them  that if the Romans thought proper to send the same commander Scipio into Africa he had good reason to hope that the existence of Carthage would be of very short duration Scipio received and heard him with much satisfaction he knew that Masinissa was the main support of the enemy with respect to cavalry and the young man himself had given considerable proofs of spirit After they had mutually pledged their faith he returned to Tarraco and Masinissa hav ing with permission of the Romans ravaged the neigh boring soil that he might not appear to have passed over to the continent for nothing returned to Gades 36 While Mago was preparing to pass into Africa despairing of success in Spain of which he had been encouraged to entertain hopes first by the mutiny of the soldiers and afterwards by the revolt of Indibilis information was brought from Carthage that the senate ordered him to carry over to Italy the fleet which he had at Gades and having there hired as many of the Gallic and Ligurian youths as he could find to form a junction with Hannibal and not to suffer the war to sink into languor after the very great exertions and greater successes which had signalised its beginning Money to answer this purpose was brought to Mago from Carthage in addition to which he extorted much from the people of Gades plundering not only their treasury but their temples and compelling them to bring in their private properties of gold and silver to the public stock As he sailed along the coast of Spain he landed his men not far from New Carthage  LIVY and having ravaged the lands adjoining brought up his fleet from thence to the city where having kept his soldiers on board the ships during the day he dis embarked them in the night and led them on to that part of the wall over which the Romans had entered when they took the place for he had a notion that the garrison was not strong and that on seeing a hope of changing masters some of the townsmen would raise a commotion But those who had fled in a panic from the fields had already brought an account of the dispersion of the country people and the approach of the enemy the fleet also had been observed during the day and it was sufficiently evident that its station before the city had not been chosen without some rea son The garrison were therefore drawn up and kept under arms withinside the gate which looks toward the basin and the sea The enemy rushing on in a tumul tuous manner with crowds of seamen mixed among the soldiers advanced to the walls with more noise than strength when the Romans suddenly throwing open the gate rushed forth with a shout and having disordered and repulsed the motley band at the first onset and discharge of their darts pursued them with great slaughter to the coast nor would one of them have survived the battle and the pursuit had not the vessels warping close to the shore received them as they fled in dismay Those on ship board also were not without their share of the confusion occasioned by the drawing up of the ladders lest the enemy should force in along with their own men and in cutting away their cables and anchors to avoid the delay of weighing them Many in attempting to swim to the ships as they could not in the declining light distinguish whi ther they ought to direct their course or what to avoid met a miserable death Next day when the fleet had fled back to the mid ocean there were found between the wall and the shore eight hundred men slain and two thousand stands of arms 37 Mago returning to Gades was not permitted to enter the place on which he put with his fleet into HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXVIII 145 Cimbis at a little distance and from thence sent am bassadors complaining of their having shut their gates against an ally and friend While they apologised for this act alleging that it had been done by a part of the multitude who were offended because some of their effects had been carried off by the soldiers when they were embarking he enticed their suffetes i which is the name of the chief magistracy among the Carthaginians and their treasurer to a conference and then ordered them to be crucified after they had been mangled with stripes From thence he sailed to the island Pityusa 3 about one hundred miles from the continent inhabited at that time by Carthaginians where the fleet was re ceived in a friendly manner and supplied not only with abundance of provisions but with a reinforce ment of young men and arms Emboldened by these succors the Carthaginian proceeded to the Balearic islands about fifty miles distant There are two of the Baleares 3 one larger and more powerful in men and arms than the other and which has also a harbor where he believed he might pass the winter commodi ously as it was now the latter end of autumn But here he met with an opposition as violent as if the in habitants of that island had been Romans As they now mostly use slings so at that time these were their only weapons in the skilful use of which the Balea i These were two magistrates chosen annually and invested with power similar to those of the Roman consuls The Car thaginians had a senate also like that of the Romans There was one peculiarity in their proceedings which deserves no tice when the members were unanimous there was no ap peal from their decision hut when opinions were divided the business devolved to the community at large For a very long time the people interfered but little with the administra tion of public affairs but afterwards by means of factions and cabals they almost intirely engrossed it to themselies which proved a principal cause of their ruin They had a council consisting of one hundred and four members called the tribunal of the hundred to which the commanders of armies were responsible for their conduct  Iviea 3 Majorca and Minorca 1IV VOL V K 146 LIVY reans universally excel all others Such a quantity therefore of stones was poured like the thickest hail on the fleet as it approached the land that not daring to enter the harbor the Carthaginians tacked about to the main They then passed over to the smaller of the Baleares which is equally fertile in soil though as already noted of lesser strength Here they landed and pitched their camp in a strong post over the har bor taking possession of the city and country without a contest Then having enlisted two thousand auxili aries and sent them to Carthage for the winter they hauled their ships on shore After Mago had departed from the coast the people of Gades surrendered to the Romans 38 Such were the transactions in Spain under the conduct and command of Publius Scipio who having committed the charge of the province to Lucius Lentu lus and Lucius Manlius Audinus returned to Rome with ten ships and having obtained an audience of the senate in the temple of Bellona without the city made a recital of his services in Spain how often he had engaged the enemy in pitched battles how many towns he had taken and what nations he had reduced under the dominion of the Roman people that he had gone into Spain against four generals and four armies who were elated with victory and that he had not left a Carthaginian in all that country On ac count of these exploits he rather made trial how far he might hope for a triumph than pushed for it with any earnestness because it was well known that no one had ever been honored with it for achievements performed unless invested with a public office When the senate was dismissed he proceeded into the city and carried before him to the treasury fourteen thou sand three hundred and forty two pounds weight of silver and of coined silver a great sum Lucius Ve turius Philo then held the assembly for electing con suls and all the centuries with extraordinary marks of attachment named Publius Scipio consul The col league joined with him was Publius Licinius Crassus HISTORY OF ROME BOOK XXVIII 147 chief pontiff We are told that this election was at tended by a greater concourse of people than any during that war They had come together from all parts not only for the purpose of giving their votes but of getting a sight of Scipio and ran in crowds both to his house and to the capitol while he was per forming sacrifice by offering to Jupiter a hundred oxen which he had vowed on occasion of the mutiny of the soldiers in Spain Strong expectations were at the same time entertained that as Cains Lutatius had finished the former Punic war so Publius Cornelius Scipio would finish the present and that as he had already expelled the Carthaginians from every part of Spain he would in like manner expel them from Italy They therefore destined Africa to him as a province as if the war in Italy were at an end The election of the pretors was then held two were appointed who were at the time plebeian ediles Spurius Lucretius and Cneius Octavius and of private rank Cneius Servilius Caepio and Lucius jEmilius Papus In the fourteenth year of the Punic war as soon as Publius Cornelius Scipio and Publius Licinius Crassus entered on the consulship the provinces for the consuls were named for Scipio Sicily without drawing lots with the consent of his colleague because the necessary attendance on religious matters required the presence of the chief pontiff in Italy for Crassus Bruttium The provinces of the pretors were then disposed of by lot that of the city fell to Cneius Servilius Arimi num so they called Gaul to Spurius Lucretius Si cily to Lucius iEmilius and Sardinia to Cneius Octa vius The senate was held in the capitol there on the matter being proposed by Publius Scipio a decree was made that the games which he had vowed during the mutiny of the soldiers in Spain should be exhibited and the expense defrayed out of the money which him self had conveyed to the treasury 39 He then introduced to the senate ambassadors from Saguntum the eldest of whom addressed them in this manner Conscript fathers although there is no 148 LIVY degree of evil beyond what we have endured in order that we might preserve our faith towards you inviolate to the last yet so highly has your behavior and that of your commanders merited at our hands that we do not repent of having exposed ourselves to sufferings On our account you undertook the war and although it is now the fourteenth year since it began yet you still maintain it with such persevering spirit as to en danger yourselves while having often brought the Car thaginians to the very brink of ruin At a time when you had so grievous a contest to maintain and with such an antagonist as Hannibal you sent your consul with an army into Spain to collect as it were what remained of us after a shipwreck Publius and Cneius Cornelius from the moment of their arrival in the pro vince never ceased to pursue measures favorable to us and destructive to our enemies They first of all regained and gave back to us our city and sending persons to search for our countrymen who had been sold and dispersed through every part of Spain they restored them from slavery to liberty When after experiencing the utmost wretchedness we were near being happily settled your commanders Publius and Cneius Cornelius fell more to be lamented in some measure by us even than by you Then indeed it ap peared as if we had been called from distant places to our original residence only that we might be a second time ruined only that we might see a second destruc tion of our country That to accomplish this there was no occasion for an army of Carthaginians we might be utterly destroyed by our oldest and most inveterate enemies the Turdulans who had also been the cause of our former calamity In which conjunc ture you speedily and beyond our expectations sent to us this Publius Scipio the author of our well being the supporter of all our hopes of whose election to the consulship our having been eye witnesses and our being able to carry home the joyful news to our coun trymen render us the happiest of the Saguntines He having taken a great number of the towns of your HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXVIII 149 enemies in Spain always separated the Saguntines from the rest of the prisoners and sent them home to their own country and lastly by his arms so hum bled Turdetaniaâ a state so inveterate in its animosity against us that if its power had continued Saguntum must have fallen â that not only we but let me say it without presumption even our posterity need have no apprehensions from it We now see their city de stroyed â the city of a people for whose gratification Hannibal ruined Saguntum We now receive tribute from their countryâ a circumstance not more gratify ing to us in the profit we derive from it than in the satisfying of our revenge In gratitude for these bless ings greater than which we could not either hope or implore from the immortal gods the senate and people of Saguntum have sent us their ten ambassadors to present their thanks and at the same time to con gratulate you on the success which has of late years attended your arms in Spain and Italy You hold the possession of Spain so acquired not only as far as the city of Iberus but to the utmost limits and boundaries by the ocean while in Italy you have left nothing to the Carthaginian but what the rampart of his camp incloses To Jove supremely great and good who presides over the fortress of the capitol we have been ordered not only to make acknowlegements for these blessings but with your permission to bear thither this offering a golden crown in token of victory We request that you will permit us this act of reverence and also that you will ratify by your authority and fix on a permanent footing the advantages bestowed on us by your commanders The senate answered the Sa guntine ambassadors that  the destruction and resto ration of Saguntum would be an example to all na tions of social faith fulfilled on both sides that their commanders in restoring that city and delivering its inhabitants from slavery had acted properly regu larly and agreeably to the intentions of the senate that all other acts of kindness shown them had like wise their approbation and that they gave them per 150 LIVY mission to deposit their charge in the capitol Orders were then given that apartments and entertainment should be provided for the ambassadors and a present made to each of them of not less than ten thousand asses i Other embassies were then introduced and heard On the Saguntines requesting that they might be allowed to take a view of Italy as far as they could go with safety guides were given them and letters despatched to all the towns requiring them to enter tain these Spaniards in a friendly manner The senate then took into consideration the state of public affairs the levying of troops and the distribution of the pro vinces 40 People in general expressed a desire that Africa should be constituted a new province and assigned to Publius Scipio without casting lots and he not con tent with a moderate share of glory affirmed that he had been appointed consul not for the purpose only of carrying on the war but of finishing it that this could be accomplished by no other means than by transporting an army into Africa declaring openly that if the senate should oppose him in that point he would carry it by the votes of the people The prin cipal senators by no means approved of the design and whilst the rest either through fear or a desire of ingratiating themselves with him declined uttering their sentiments Quintus Fabius Maximus being asked his opinion expressed himself to this effect I know conscript fathers that many among you are of opinion that we are this day deliberating on an affair already determined and that he will expend words to little purpose who shall deliver his sentiments on the subject of Africa being constituted a province as on a matter open to discussion Yet in the first place I do not understand how Africa can be a province already se cured to that brave andi active commander our consul when neither the senate have voted nor the people ordered that it should at all be considered as such i 32l Ss 10d HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXVIII 161 and again if it were in my judgment it is the consul who acts amiss for it is a mockery of the senate to pretend to consult them on a question if already de cided and not the senator who in his place would speak to the business which he supposed in hand Now I am well aware that by disapproving this vio lent haste to pass over into Africa I expose myself to two impulations one the caution natural to my tem per which young men have my free consent to call cowardice and sloth while I have no reason to be sorry that although the schemes of others always car ried at first view a more specious appearance yet mine were on experience found to be more useful The other imputation to which I shall be liable is that of detraction and envy towards the rising glory of the valiant consul â from a suspicion of which kind if neither my past life and morals can free me nor a dictatorship and five consulships together with such a store of glory acquired in the transactions both of war and peace that it is more likely I should be satiated than desirous of more let my age at least acquit me For what emulation can I have with him who is not equal in age even to my son When I was dictator when I was in full vigor and proceeding in a course of the greatest achievements no one heard me either in the senate or before the people make opposition to the proposed measure although such as had never before been heard of even in conversation of con ferring power equal to mine on the master of the horse and who at the very time was endeavoring to injure my character I chose to effect my purpose by actions rather than words and that he who was set on a level with me in the judgment of others should at length by his own confession allow me a superiority over him Much less would I now after having passed through every dignity of the state propose to myself contests and emulations with a man blooming in youth Is it that Africa if refused to him might be decreed as a province to me â to me already wearied not only with the toils of business but even with length of 152 LIVY years No with that glory which I have already acquired 1 am to live and die I stopped the career of Hannibal s conquests that you whose powers are now in vigor might be able to gain conquests over him 41 As I never in my own case regarded the opi nion of the world when set in competition with the ad vantage of the state it will be but reasonable that you pardon me Publius Cornelius if I do not consider even your fame in preference to the public good If either there were no war in Italy or the enemy here were such that a victory over him would be produc tive of no glory he who should attempt to retain you in Italy notwithstanding that he consulted therein the general welfare might seem to intend while he re strained you from removing the war to deprive you of a subject of future glory Yet Hannibal a powerful enemy with an army unimpaired maintains a footing in Italy for the fourteenth year Would you then have reason to be dissatisfied Publius Cornelius with your share of fame if you should in your consulate expel such a foe from out of Italy a foe who has been the cause of so much mourning of so many calamities to us 1 In fine should you not be content to enjoy the reputation of having finished the present Punic war as Caius Lutatius did that of finishing the former Unless indeed you will say that Hamilcar is a gene ral more formidable than Hannibal or that a war in Africa is of greater importance than it would be in Italy that a victory there supposing it should be our good fortune to obtain such while you are consul would be more profitable and illustrious than one here Would you choose to draw away Hamilcar from Dre panum or Eryx rather than to expel the Carthaginians and Hannibal out of Italy Although you should look with a more partial regard on the renown which you have acquired than on that which you have in pros pect yet surely you would not pride yourself so much in having freed Spain as in freeing Italy Hannibal is not yet in such a condition that he who prefers en gaging with another general must not evidently ap Ik HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXVMI 163 pear to be actuated by fear of him rather than by contempt Why then do you not direct your efforts to this point and carry the strength of the war imme diately to the place where Hannibal is and not by that circuition presuming that when you shall have passed into Africa Hannibal will follow you thither Do you wish to be crowned with the distinguished honor of having finished the Punic war In the very nature of things you are to defend your own pro perty before you attack another s Let peace be re stored in Italy before hostilities commence in Africa Let us be delivered from fear ourselves before we at tempt to make others afraid of us If both can be ac complished under your conduct and auspices it will be well After you have vanquished Hannibal at home then go and lay siege to Carthage If one or the other of these conquests must be left to succeeding consuls the former as it will be the more important and the more glorious will be also the cause of the subsequent one for in the present state of affairs besides that the treasury cannot maintain two different armies one in Italy and another in Africa besides that we have nothing left us wherewith we could equip fleets or be able to supply provisions who does not see what dan ger must be incurred Publius Licinius will wage war in Italy Publius Scipio in Africa What if Han nibal having gained a superiority should advance to the city may all the gods avert the omen my mind is shocked even at mentioning it but what has hap pened may happen again will that be a time for us to be obliged to send for you the consul from Africa as we sent for Quintus Fulvius from Capua Besides are we to suppose that in Africa the chances of war will not be the same with both parties Let your fa ther and your uncle be a warning to you cut oflF together with their armies in the space of thirty days and after having during a course of several years by their great services as well on land as at sea rendered the name of the Roman people and of your family in the highest degree illustrious among foreign states 154 LIVY The whole day would not be sufficient were I to re count to you all the kings and generals who by pass ing rashly into an enemy s country have brought the greatest calamities on themselves and their armies The Athenians for instance a state remarkable for prudence having at the instigation of a youth who was distinguished as much by his active spirit as by his nobility neglected a war at home and sent over a large fleet to Sicily their commonwealth at that time in a most florishing condition suffered in one naval engagement such a blow as could never be re trieved 42 But not to bring examples from distant coun tries and times of such remote antiquity Africa itself and Marcus Atilius a remarkable instance of both ex tremes of fortune may serve as a warning to us Be assured Publius Cornelius that when yon shall have a view of Africa from the sea all your exploits in Spain will appear to you to have been only matter of sport and play For in what circumstance can they be compared After sailing along the coasts of Italy and Gaul where there was nothing to oppose you you carried your fleet into the harbor of Emporiae a city belonging to our allies and having landed your men you led them through countries intirely free from danger to Tarraco to the friends and allies of the Roman people From Tarraco you passed amid Ro man garrisons It was on the Iberus indeed that the armies of your father and uncle were exasperated by the loss of their generals their new commander being Lucius Marcius irregularly appointed it is true and chosen for the time by the suffrages of the soldiers but except that he wanted a noble birth and a regu lar course of promotion equal to many celebrated captains in every military accomplishment The siege of New Carthage you carried on quite at your leisure while neither of the three Carthaginian armies attempted to relieve the place As to the rest of your exploits I am far from wishing to lessen their merit but they are certainly by no means to be compared with a war in HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXVIII 166 Africa where there is not a single harbor open to onr fleet no part of the country at peace with us no state our ally no king our friend no room any where either to stand or advance On whatever side you turn your eyes all things are hostile and threaten ing Will you depend on Syphax and the Numi dians Suffice it to say that they were once trusted Rashness is not always successful and hypocrisy by acquiring a foundation of credit in smaller matters prepares for itself the opportunity of deceiving with greater advantage The foe did not get the better of your father and uncle by arms until their Celtiberian allies had first got the better of them by treachery Nor were you yourself brought into so much danger by Mago and Hasdrnbal the enemy s generals as by lndibilis and Mandonius whom you had received into your protection Can you who have experienced a defection of your own soldiers place any confidence in Numidians Both Syphax and Masinissa are desirous of becoming the greatest powers in Africa to the ex clusion of the Carthaginians but still they prefer the interest of those people to that of any other state At present mutual emulation embitters them against each other and which arises from their feeling no imme diate apprehensions from any foreign force The mo ment they behold the Roman arms they will instantly unite as if to extinguish a fire equally threatening them both The efforts which these same Carthagi nians made in support of Spain were widely different from what they will exert in defence of the walls of their native city of the temples of their gods their altars and their dwellings when their wives dis tracted with fear shall accompany them as they go to battle and their helpless children gather round them Besides what if the Carthaginians thinking them selves sufficiently secured by the harmony subsisting in Africa by the faith of the kings their allies and by their own fortifications should on seeing Italy de prived of your protection either send over a new army from Africa into Italy or order Mago who we know 156 LIVY has sailed over from the Baleares and is now cruising on the coast of the Alpine Ligurians to join his forces to those of Hannibal We should then be seized with the same terror which we felt lately on hearing of the approach of Hasdrubal and whom you who are to shut up with your army not only Carthage but all Africa allowed to slip through your hands into Italy You will say that he was defeated by you the less for that very reason can I wish that be should be per mitted after being defeated to march into this coun try and that not only on the account of the public but your own also Allow us to ascribe to your good conduct all those events in your province which were favorable to you and to the state and to impute such as were unfavorable to fortune and to the chances of war The more merit and bravery you possess the more is your country and all Italy concerned to keep at home so powerful a protector You cannot but ac knowlege that wherever Hannibal is there the main stress and head of the present war must be looked for yet the reason you give for passing over into Africa is that you may draw Hannibal thither Whether the Carthaginians therefore be in this country or in that your business is to oppose him Now I pray you whether will you be better able to cope with him in Africa where you are to stand alone or here with the army of your colleague joined to your own Is not the importance of this consideration sufficiently evinced by the recent fate of the consuls Claudius and Livius What is Hannibal to be feared here as re ceiving an augmentation of men and arms from the re motest corner of the country of Bruttium and which he in vain solicits from home or with Carthage at his back and all Africa confederated with him What is this plan of choosing to fight there where your forces must be less by half and those of the enemy considerably greater rather than here at the head of two armies against one and that one impaired in strength by so many battles and by such long and la borious service Consider well how far this plan of HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXVIII 157 yours resembles that of your father He in his con sulship after having gone to Spain came back from his province to Italy in order to meet Hannibal as he was descending from the Alps you when Hannibal is in Italy intend to quit the country not because you judge that measure useful to the state but because you expect from it splendor and glory to yourself Just as when without an order of the commons without a de cree of the senate you left your province and your army â yes you a commander employed by the Ro man people intrusted to two ships the fortune of the public and the majesty of the empire which were then exposed to hazard in your person In my judg ment conscript fathers Publius Cornelius Scipio was elected consul for the purpose of serving us and the people not for his own private schemes of ambition In my opinion the armies were enlisted for the pro tection of the city and of Italy and not to be carried about by the consuls with king like ostentation in gratification of their own vanity and to any part of the world they may think proper 43 By this speech formed for the occasion by his authority and his established character for prudence Fabius influenced a great part of the senate especially those advanced in years and a greater number ap proving of the wariness of the sage than of the spirit of the youth Scipio is said to have spoken thus Conscript fathers even Quintus Fabius himself in the beginning of his speech has acknowleged that in the declaration which he has made of his sentiments he might possibly be suspected of detraction and al though I will not presume to bring a charge of such a nature against so great a man yet certainly whether through a defect in his discourse or in the subject the suspicion has not been removed For in order to avoid the imputation of envy he has extolled his own honors and the fame of his exploits in very magnifi cent terms tending to show that whatever competition I may enter into with others however I may fear that some person now in obscurity may one day be LIVY equal with me yet from him I have no kind of rivalry to apprehend for he has attained to such a height of eminence that he will not suffer me at any time to be placed on a level with him however anxi ously I may wish it and that I do wish it I will by no means dissemble He has therefore represented himself as a man of gravity and wisdom who has passed through every degree of public honors and me as below the age even of his son  as if ambition extended not its views beyond the present life and did not look forward to posterity and future remembrance as the greatest possible reward I well know that it is usual with persons of exalted merit to compare themselves with the illustrious men not only of the present but of every age and I do not deny Quin tus Fabius that I wish not only to overtake you in the race of glory but pardon the expression to outrun you if I can That disposition of mind will not I hope affect you towards me nor me towards my juniors that we should be displeased if any of our countrymen became distinguished like ourselves for that would be an injury not only to those who were the objects of our envy but to the state and in some measure to all mankind Fabius has descanted on the danger which I must incur if I pass into Africa so as to appear anxious not only about the safety of the nation and the army but about mine Whence has this concern for me so suddenly arisen when my fa ther and uncle were slain when their two armies were cutoff almost to a man when Spain was lost when four armies and four generals of the Carthaginians by terror and by arms kept possession of every thing when the public were at a loss for a general to conduct that war and no one stepped forward except myself when no one dared to declare himself a candidate when the Roman people had conferred the command on me though but twenty four years oldâ how hap pened it that no mention was then made of my age of the power of the enemy of the difficulties of opposing him or of the recent calamity of my relatives Has HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXVIII 159 any greater misfortune befallen us in Africa than had at that time been experienced in Spain Are there now on that continent more numerous armies or better generals than there were then in Spain Was I fitter at that time of life for conducting a war than I am now Is a contest with a Carthaginian enemy less difficult in Spain than in Africa It is an easy matter after four Carthaginian armies routed and intirely dis persed after so many cities taken by force or terri fied into a surrender while all places even as far as the ocean have been brought under intire subjection while so many princes so many savage nations have been wholly reduced in a word after all Spain has been reconquered and in such a manner as that no trace of war remains â it is easy I say to depreciate the value of my services  just as easy in truth as it will be if I shall return victorious from Africa to make light of those very circumstances which are now so greatly aggravated and painted in such terrible colors for the purpose of detaining me here It is affirmed that no entrance can be found into Africa that there are no harbors open to us that Marcus Ati lius was taken prisoner there as if Marcus Atilins had miscarried on approaching that coast But Fabius does not recollect that this commander afterwards indeed unfortunate found the harbors of Africa open and during the first year performed extraordinary ser vices and as far as concerned the Carthaginian gene rals remained unconquered to the last The example which you produce therefore does not in the least deter me If that loss had even been sustained in the present war and not in the former if lately and not forty years ago yet why should I not as well pass into Africa after Regulus was made prisoner as into Spain after the Scipios were slain nor suffer it to be said that the birth of Xanthippus a Lacedaemo nian was by the defeat of our consul more fortunate to Carthage than mine to my own country and why might not I assume additional confidence from that very circumstance that it was possible for the bravery 160 LIVY of one man a Spartan to produce such important consequences 1 But we are also told of the Athenians neglecting a war at home and passing inconsiderately into Sicily Why do you not rather since you have leisure to recount Grecian fables mention Agathocles king of Syracuse who when Sicily was for a long time wasted by a Punic war by passing over into this same Africa averted that war to the place from whence it came 44  But what need is there either of ancient or foreign examples to remind us how useful it is to spread terror among the enemy by a sudden attack and after removing the danger to a distance from our selves to make him abide the hazard Can there be any greater or more striking instance than is found in Hannibal Between wasting the territories of others and seeing our own destroyed with fire and sword the difference is immense The assailant has ever more spirit than the defendant and people s apprehensions are the greater in the latter case When you have entered an enemy s territories you can then see more distinctly the advantages and disadvantages which per tain to the same Hannibal never entertained a hope that so many nations in Italy would revolt to him as did and which was induced by our misfortune at CannEB How much less can any firm and steady sup port in Africa be expected by the Carthaginians who are themselves faithless allies severe and haughty masters As to ourselves even when deserted by confederates we stood firm in our own natural strength the soldiery of Rome This the Carthaginians do not possess besides their soldiers are procured for hire â Africans with Numidians of all men the most un steady in their attachments If no obstruction be thrown in my way at home you shall shortly hear that I have made good my descent and that Africa is in a blaze of war that Hannibal in returning thither comes but to experience a defeat and that Carthage is besieged in fine expect confidently more frequent and more joyful dispatches from that continent than HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXVIII 161 you received from Spain These hopes are suggested to me by the fortune of the Roman people the gods who witnessed the treaty which the enemy have vio lated and the friendship of the kings Syphax and Masinissa to whom I shall look for aid while securing myself against perfidy The war will disclose many things which do not appear now and it is the business of a general not to fail of improving the overtures of fortune and to convert casual occurrences to the ac complishment of his designs I shall Quintus Fabius have the antagonist whom you assign me Hannibal I shall compel him to fight in his own country and Carthage rather shall be the prize than the half ruined forts of the Bruttians With respect to the security of the state and that it should suffer no injury while I am on my passage while I am landing my army in Africa while I am marching forwards to Carthage be careful in any assertion as to what you Quintus Fabius were able to accomplish at a time when Han nibal was pursuing a rapid career of victory through all parts of Italy be mindful I say lest it be consi dered as an insult that you do not too freely affirm of him that shaken and almost broken in pieces his overthrow by Publius Licinius the consul were easy â a man by the way of the most consummate valor and who declined the lot of so distant a province as Africa only because being chief pontiff he must not be ab sent from his religious duties In fact even though the war were not to be brought to a speedier conclu sion by the method which I propose still it would concern the dignity of the Roman people and their reputation among foreign kings and nations that we should appear to have spirit not only to defend Italy but to carry our arms into Africa and that it should not be spread abroad and believed that no Roman general dared what Hannibal had dared and that in the former Punic war when the contest was about Sicily Africa had been often attacked by our fleets and armies but that now when the contest is about Italy Africa should enjoy peace Let Italy so long Liv vol v I 162 LIVY harassed enjoy at length some repose let Africa in its turn feel fire and sword Let the Roman camp press on the very gates of Carthage rather than that we a second time should behold from our walls the rampart of that of the enemy Let Africa in short be the seat of the remainder of the war thither be removed terror and flight devastation of lands revolt of allies and all the other calamities with which for fourteen years we have been afflicted It is sufficient that I have delivered my sentiments on those matters which affect the state the dispute in which we are in volved and the provinces under consideration my discourse would be tedious and unsuitable to this au dience if as Quintus Fabius has depreciated my ser vices in Spain I should on the other hand endeavor in like manner to disparage his glory and extol my own  I shall do neither conscript fathers but young as I am I will show that I excel that sage if in no thing else yet certainly in modesty and temperance of language Such has been my life and conduct that I can in silence rest perfectly satisfied with that cha racter which your own judgments have formed of me 45 Scipio was heard the less favorably on account of a rumor which prevailed that if he did not carry the point in the senate of having Africa decreed to him as his province he was determined immediately to submit the business to public decision Therefore Quintus Fulvius who had been consul four times and censor demanded of the consul that he should declare openly in the senate whether  he meant to abide by the determination of the fathers in regard to the pro vinces or whether he intended to bring the matter be fore the people Scipio having answered that he would act in such a manner as he should deem most advantageous to the state Fulvius replied  I did not ask the question through ignorance of what you would answer and what you intended to do It is thus plainly seen that you are rather sounding the senate than consulting them and have an order ready to be pro posed to the people if we do not immediately decree HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXVIII J63 to 3fou the province that you desire I therefore call on you tribunes to support me in refusing to give my opinion and for this reason that although a majority should concur with me yet the consul would appeal from their judgment On this an altercation arose Scipio insisting that it was unfair for the tribunes to interpose so as to prevent any senator from giving his opinion on being asked it in his place The tribunes determined thus If the consul submits the regula tion of the provinces to the senate we are satisfied that their decision shall be final and we will not suffer that matter to be carried before the people if he does not so submit it we will support such as shall refuse to give their opinion on the subject The consul de sired time until the next day that he might confer with his colleague and the affair was then submitted to the senate who decreed the provinces in this man ner to one consul Sicily and the thirty ships of war which Caius Servilius had commanded the preceding year with permission to pass over into Africa if he should judge it for the advantage of the state to the other Bruttium and the war against Hannibal with the army which Lucius Veturius or that which Quin tus Caecilius commanded that these latter should cast lots or settle between themselves which of them should command in Bruttium with the two legions which would be left by the consul and that he to whose lot that province fell should be continued in it for another year The others also who were to have the charge of armies besides the consuls and pretors had their commission prolonged It fell by lot to Quintus Cascilius that in conjunction with the consul he should manage the war against Hannibal in Brut tium Scipio s games were then exhibited to a vast concourse of spectators who expressed the highest ap probation Marcus Pomponius Matho and Quintus Catius being sent ambassadors to Delphi with a pre sent out of the spoils of Hasdrubal carried a golden crown of two hundred pounds weight and representa tions of the prizes formed of one thousand pounds 164 LIVY weight of silver Although Scipio had not obtained nor earnestly solicited authority to levy soldiers he yet was permitted to iurol volunteers and as he had declared that the fleet should be no expense to the public so he might receive such contributions as should be offered by the allies for building new ships The states of Etruria first promised to give assistance to the consul proportioned to the respective abilities of each the people of Caere engaged to bring corn and provisions of all kinds for the seamen the Populo nians iron the Tarquinians canvass for sails the Volaterrans tackling and corn the Arretians thirty thousand shields the same number of helmets of javelins short pikes and long spears each an equal number amounting in the whole to fifty thousand to Supply axes mattocks bills buckets and millstones sufficient for forty ships of war with one hundred and twenty thousand pecks of wheat they also promised to contribute to the expense of the decurionsi and rowers The people of Per ium Clusium and Ru sella gave assurance of fir lor building ships and a large quantity of corn The states of Umbria with the people of Nursia Reate and Amiternum and the whole country of the Sabines engaged to furnish sol diers Fir however he took out of the woods belong ing to the state Great numbers of the Marsians Pe lignians and Marrusinians voluntarily gave in their names to serve in the fleet The Camertans though confederated with the Romans on equal terms sent a cohort of six hundred men and arms Having laid the keels of thirty ships twenty quinqueremes and ten quadriremes Scipio pressed forward the work by his personal attendance in such a manner that on the forty fifth day after the timber had been brought from the woods the ships were rigged armed and launched 46 The consul proceeded to Sicily with thirty ships of war having embarked about seven thousand volun i Officers who had the command of the rowers HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXVIII 165 teers Publius Licinius came into Bruttium to the two consular armies of which he chose for himself that which had been commanded by the late consul Lucius Veturius he placed Metellus at the head of the same legions as before because he thought it would be the easier for him to transact business with those who were accustomed to his command the pre tors also repaired to their different provinces Money for the war being wanting the questors were ordered to sell a district of the Campanian territory extending from the Grecian trench to the sea they were also empowered to make inquiry what lands had been the property of any native in order that they might be transferred to the Roman people with a reward to any informer of the tenth part of the value of the lands so discovered It was also given in charge to Cneius Servilius pretor of the city that the natives of Campania should be obliged to remain in those places which had been decreed for their residence by the se nate and that such as removed to any other should be punished During the same summer Mago son of Hamilcar after having spent the winter in the smaller of the Baleares and having there embarked a chosen body of young men on board his fleet which consisted of near thirty ships of war and a great number of transports carried into Italy twelve thousand foot and about two thousand horse and by his unexpected arrival surprised Genoa there being no forces sta tioned to protect the coast From thence he sailed to the coast of the Alpine Ligurians to try if he could raise any commotions there The Ingaunians a tribe of the Ligurians were at that time engaged in war with the Epanterians who inhabited the mountains the Carthaginian therefore having deposited his plun der at Savo a town of the Alps and left a squadron of ten ships of war to protect it sent the rest to Car thage to guard the sea coast a report being spread that Scipio intended to pass over thither He then formed an alliance with the Ingaunians whose friend ship he esteemed resolving in person to attack the 166 LIVY mountaineers His army increased daily the Gauls induced by the greatness of his character pouring in from all sides When the senate were informed of these proceedings by letters from Spurius Lucretius they were filled with much anxiety apprehending that the joy which they had conceived on the destruction of Hasdrubal and his army two years before would prove ill founded if another war equal to the former only under a different general were to arise from the same quarter They therefore commanded Marcus Livius proconsul to march an army of volunteer slaves from Etruria to Ariminum at the same time charging the pretor Cneins Servilius if he judged it advantageous to the state to order the city legions to be led into the field by such commander as he should think proper Marcus Valerius Laevinus conducted those legions to Arretium About this time eighty transport ships of the Carthaginians were taken on the coast of Sardinia by Cneius Octavius who held the government of that province Caalius relates that these were laden with corn and provisions for Hannibal Valerius that they were carrying to Carthage the plunder of Etruria and the Ligurian mountaineers who had been made prisoners In Bruttium hardly any thing memorable happened during that year A pestilence had attacked both Romans and Carthagi nians with equal violence except that the Carthagi nians besides the disorder were distressed by famine Hannibal spent the summer near the temple of Juno Lacinea where he built and dedicated an altar with an inscription in the Carthaginian and Greek charac ters containing a pompous recital of his exploits HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXIX 167 BOOK XXIX Chap I When Scipio arrived in Sicily be formed his volunteers into cohorts and centuries of which forces he kept three hundred about him all of them vigorous young men and ignorant of the purpose for which they were reserved being neither inrolled in the centuries nor supplied with arms Then out of the whole number of youths in Sicily he chose also three hundred of distinguished birth and fortune as horsemen who were to pass over with him into Africa appointing a day on which they were to attend equipped and furnished with horses and arms This service ap peared to them very severe being so far from home and attended with great fatigues and great dangers both by sea and land so much so that not only them selves but their parents and relations were distressed with anxiety on their account At the time appointed they brought their horses and arms to be inspected Scipio then told them that  he was informed that some of the Sicilian horsemen dreaded the service on which they were going as laborious and severe that if any were thus affected he wished them to acknowlege it then to him rather than to complain afterwards and prove inactive and useless soldiers to the state he desired them to express their sentiments freely as suring them they should be listened to without dis pleasure On which one of them ventured to say that if he had a free option he certainly would wish to decline the service Scipio replied Since then young man you have not dissembled your sentiments I will provide a substitute for you to whom you must deliver your horse your arms and other implements of war take him hence directly to your house exercise him and take care that he be instructed in the management of his horse and arms These terms the other em braced with joy on which Scipio put into his hands 168 LIVY one of the three hundred whom he kept unarmed When the others saw the horseman discharged in this manner with the approbation of the general each be gan to excuse himself and receive a substitute Thus were Roman horsemen substituted in the place of the three hundred Sicilians without any expense to the public The Sicilians had the trouble of instructing and exercising them the general having ordered that any who did not perform this should continue in the service We are told that this proved an excellent body of horse and did good service to the state in many battles Afterwards reviewing the legions he chose out of them those soldiers who had been the longest time in the army especially those who had served with Marcellus believing that they were not only formed under the best discipline but in conse quence of the long siege of Syracuse were best skilled in the method of attacking towns for the object to which his views were now directed was no small mat ter being nothing less than the utter destruction of Carthage He then cantoned his army in the different towns ordered in a supply of corn from the Sicilian states sparing what he had brought from Italy re paired the old ships and sent Caius Laelius with them to Africa to plunder the country then hauled up the new ones on land at Panormus that they might lie dry during the winter because they had been hastily built of green timber and having completed the prepara tions for the war he came to Syracuse where tran quillity was not yet intirely re established after the late violent commotion The Greeks in pursuance of a grant of the senate demanding a restoration of their effects from some Italians who kept possession of them with the same force with which they had seized them Scipio reckoning it essentially requisite to support the public faith procured a restitution of the same partly by a proclamation issued and partly by sentences passed against those who persisted in retaining their unjust acquisitions This proceeding was highly ac ceptable not only to the persons aggrieved but to all HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXIX 169 the states of Sicily and added to their alacrity in for warding the preparations for war 2 A formidable war was raised this summer in Spain by the instigation of Indibilis the Illergetian on no other grounds than the contempt which through his great admiration of Scipio he entertained of all other generals He was of opinion that this commander was the only one whom the Romans had remaining the others of any note having as he conceived been slain by Hannibal for when the Scipios were cut off in Spain they had none whom they could send thither and afterwards when the war pressed too heavily on them in Italy the present one had been recalled to act against Hannibal That besides the Romans having only nominal generals in Spain their veteran army bad been withdrawn from thence that among the troops which remained there was neither spirit nor firmness as they consisted of an undisciplined multi tude of new recruits that there would never again be such an opportunity of asserting the liberty of Spain that until that day they had been slaves either to the Carthaginians or Romans and that not to one or the other by turns but sometimes to both together that the Carthaginians had been expelled by the Romans and that the Romans might now be expelled by the Spaniards if these would act with unanimity so that being for ever freed from the dominion of foreigners they might return to their own native manners and rites By these and other the like discourses he roused to arms not only his own countrymen but the Ausetanians also a neighboring state with other na tions that bordered on his and their country so that within a few days thirty thousand foot and about four thousand horse assembled in the territory of Sedeta according to his directions On the other side the Roman generals Lucius Lentulus and Lucius Manliui Acidinus lest the war being neglected in the begin ning should spread with increasing violence united their armies and conducting them through the coun try of the Ausetanians in as peaceable a manner as if 170 LIVY they were among friends they arrived at the place where the enemy lay and pitched their tents at three miles distance from the Spanish camp By sending ambassadors they endeavored to prevail on them to lay aside their arms but in vain Afterwards the Spanish horsemen having made a sudden attack on the foragers of the Romans and the latter sending some troops to support them from one of their outposts there ensued a battle between the cavalry in which neither side gained any considerable advantage 3 At sunrise next day the whole force of the enemy appeared in arms and drawn up in order of battle at the distance of about a mile from the Roman camp The Ausetanians were in the centre the Illergetians formed the right wing and people of several inconsi derable Spanish states the left between the wings and the main body they had left very wide intervals through which the horse might charge on occasion The Ro mans drew up their army in the usual manner yet so far following the example of the enemy as to leave passages open for the cavalry between the legions Lentulus however considering that the horse could be of use only to that party which should first make an attack on the enemy s line divided by the intervals commanded Servius Cornelius tribune of the soldiers to order them to charge through the same The fight between the infantry being rather unfavorable to the Romans at the beginning he was obliged to delay for a time while the thirteenth legion from the reserve was brought up to the first line so as to support the twelfth which had been posted in the left wing against the Illergetians and which began to give ground The fight being restored Scipio hastened to Lucius Manlius who was exerting himself among the foremost batta lions encouraging and supporting his men by a supply of fresh troops wherever occasion required and ac quainted him that matters were safe on the left wing and that Cornelius Servius whom he had despatched for the purpose would quickly assail the enemy on all sides with his cavalry Scarcely had he uttered these HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXIX 171 words when the Roman horse pushing forwards into the midst of their ranks threw the line of infantry into confusion and at the same time closed up the passes by which the Spanish horse were to have ad vanced to a charge The Spaniards therefore quitting all thoughts of fighting on horseback dismounted in order to engage on foot When the Roman generals perceived the enemy s disorder that they were con fused and terrified and their battalions wavering they encouraged they intreated their men to push them briskly while they were dismayed and not to suffer their line to be formed again The barbarians could not have withstood so furious an onset had not their prince Indibilis dismounting with the cavalry thrown himself into the front of the foremost battalions of in fantry There the contest was supported for some time with great fury At length those who fought round the king fell overwhelmed with darts and he himself continuing to make resistance though ready to expire was pinned to the earth with a javelin on which their troops betook themselves to flight in all â parts The number of the slain was the greater be cause the horsemen had not time to remount their horses being vigorously pressed by the Romans who did not relax in the least until they had driven them from their camp There fell on that day of the Spa niards thirteen thousand and about eight hundred were taken Of the Romans and their allies little more than two hundred were killed most of them on the left wing The Spaniards who were beaten out of the camp or who had escaped from the battle at first dispersed about the country and afterwards returned to their respective homes They were soon after sum moned thence to an assembly by Mandonius where after complaining heavily of their losses and severely censuring the advisers of the war they came to a reso lution that ambassadors should be sent to Scipio with proposals to make surrender of themselves These laid the blame on Indibilis and the other chiefs most of whom had fallen in battle offering to deliver up 172 LivY their arms They received for answer that their sur render would be accepted provided they delivered up alive Mandonius and the other promoters of the war that if this condition was not complied with the Ro mans would lead their armies into the lands of the Illergetians and Ausetanians and afterwards into those of the other states This answer the ambassadors car ried back to the assembly and there Mandonius and the other chiefs were seized and delivered up to pu nishment Terms of peace were then settled with the states of Spain who were ordered to pay double taxes for that year and to supply corn for six months toge ther with cloaks and vests for the army hostages being received from about thirty states This tumultuary rebellion in Spain having been thus suppressed with out any great difficulty within the space of a few days after its commencement every warlike operation was directed against Africa 4 Caius Lajlius having arrived in the night at Hippo Royal led out his soldiers and marines in regular bodies at the first light in order to ravage the country and as the inhabitants had taken no pre cautions more than if it had been a time of peace great damage was done and affrighted messengers filled Carthage with the most violent alarms affirming that the Roman fleet had arrived and that it was com manded by Scipio of whose passing into Sicily they had already heard Nor could they tell with any de gree of exactness while their fears aggravated every circumstance how many ships they had seen or what number of men they had landed At first therefore consternation and terror afterwards melancholy de jection seized the people s minds reflecting on the re verse of fortune which had taken place and lamenting that they who lately flushed with success had their forces lying at the gates of Rome and after cutting off so many armies of the enemy had made almost every state in Italy submit to them either through fear or choice were now from the current of success having turned against them to behold the devastation of HISTORY OF ROME BOOK XXIX 173 Africa and the siege of Carthage and when they possessed not by any means such a degree of strength as the Romans had enjoyed to support them under those calamities The latter had received from the commonalty of Rome and from Latium continually increasing supplies of young men in the room of so many legions destroyed but the citizens of Carthage were unwarlike and equally so in the country Auxi liaries indeed they had procured for pay from among the Africans but they were a faithless race and veer ing about with every blast of fortune Then as to the kings Sypfaax since his conference with Scipio was apparently estranged from them Masinissa had openly renounced their alliance and was become their most inveterate enemy so that they had no hope no sup port on any side Neither did Mago raise any com motions on the side of Gaul nor join his forces to Hannibal s and Hannibal himself was now declining both in reputation and strength Their minds which in consequence of the late news had sunk into these desponding reflections were again recalled by dread of the impending evils to consult how they might op pose the present dangers They resolved to levy soldiers with all haste both in the city and the coun try to hire auxiliaries from the Africans  to strengthen the forts to collect oorn to prepare weapons and ar mor to fit out ships and send them to Hippo against the Roman fleet While they were thus employed news at length arrived that it was Laelius and not Scipio who had come over that his forces were no more than what were sufficient to make plundering incursions and that the main force of the enemy was still in Sicily Thus they got time to breathe and began to despatch em bassies to Syphax and the other princes to endeavor to strengthen their alliances They also sent to Philip with a promise of two hundred talents of silver i on con dition that he invaded Sicily or Italy Others were sent to Italy to their two generals there with orders 38 750 174 LIVY to use every effort to raise the apprehensions of the enemy so that Scipio might be induced to return home To Mago they sent not only deputies but twenty five ships of war six thousand foot eight hundred horse seven elephants and also a large sum of money to hire auxiliaries whose support might encourage him to ad vance his army nearer to the city of Rome and effect a junction with Hannibal Such were the preparations and plans at Carthage Whilst Laelius was employed in carrying off immense booty from the country which he found destitute of arms and protection Masinissa roused by the report of the arrival of a Roman fleet came to him attended by a few horsemen He com plained that Scipio was dilatory in the business otherwise before that time he would have brought over his army into Africa while the Carthaginians were dis mayed and Syphax engaged in wars with his neigh bors That the latter was irresolute and undetermined and that if time were allowed him to settle his own af fairs as he liked it would be seen that he had no sin cere attachment to the Romans He desired him to exhort and stimulate Scipio to activity assuring him that he himself though driven from his kingdom would join him with no contemptible force both of horse and foot He said that  Lnelius ought not to make any stay in Africa that he believed a fleet had sailed from Carthage which it would not be very safe to encounter in the absence of Scipio After this dis course Masinissa departed and next day Laelius set sail from Hippo having his ships laden with spoil and returning to Sicily delivered Masinissa s message to Scipio 5 About the same time the ships which had been sent from Carthage to Mago arrived on the coast be tween the country of the Albingannian Ligurians and Genoa near which place the Carthaginian happened at that time to lie with his fleet On receiving orders from the deputies to collect as great a number of troops as possible he immediately held a council of the Gauls and Ligurians for there was a vast multi HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXIX 175 tude of both nations present and told them that he had been sent for the purpose of restoring them to liberty and as they themselves saw aid was now af forded him from home But with what force with how great an army the war was to be carried on was a matter that depended intirely on them That there were two Roman armies one in Gaul another in Etru ria and he was well assured that Spurius Lucretius would join his forces to those of Marcus Livius where fore they on their side must arm many thousands to enable them to oppose two Roman generals and two armies The Gauls answered that they had the strongest inclination to act as he advised but as they had one Roman army in the heart of their country and another in the next adjoining province of Etruria al most within their sight if it should be publicly known that they gave aid to the Carthaginians those two armies would immediately commence hostilities against them on both sides They requested him to  demand such assistance only as the Gauls could supply in secret The Ligurians they said  were at liberty to determine as they thought fit the Roman camps being far distant from their lands and cities besides it was reasonable that they should arm their youth and take their part in the war This the Ligurians did not decline they only required two months time to make their levies Mago having sent home the Gauls hired soldiers privately in their country pro visions also of all kinds were sent to him secretly by their several states Marcus Livius led his army of volunteer slaves from Etruria into Gaul and having joined Lucretius kept himself in readiness to oppose Mago if he should move from Liguria towards the city intending if the Carthaginian should keep him self quiet under that corner of the Alps to continue in the same district near Ariminum for the protection of Italy 6 After the return of Caius Laelius from Africa al though Scipio was urged to expedition by the repre sentations of Masiuissa and the soldiers on seeing the 176 LIVY spoil which was landed from the ships were inflamed with a desire of passing over immediately yet this more important business was interrupted by one of smaller consideration the recovery of Locri which at the time of the general defection of Italy had re volted to the Carthaginians The hope of accomplish ing this was kindled by a very trifling circumstance the operations in Bruttium were rather predatory excur sions than a regular war the Numidians having begun the practice and the Bruttians readily joining in it not more from their connexion with the Carthaginians than from their own natural disposition At length the Romans themselves by a kind of contagion be came equally fond of plunder and when not pre vented by their officers made excursions into the ene my s country By these some Locrensians who had come out of the city had been surrounded and carried off to Rhegium and among whom were some artizans who happened to have been often hired by the Cartha ginians to work in the citadel of Locri They were known by the chiefs of the Locrensians who having been banished by the opposite faction which had given up the city to Hannibal had retired to Rhegium The prisoners after answering many of their inquiries con cerning affairs at home gave them hopes that if they were ransomed and sent back they might be able to put the citadel into their hands telling them that they had their residence in it and were intirely trusted by the Carthaginians In consequence of this the said chiefs who anxiously longed to return to Locri in flamed at the same time with a desire of revenge im mediately ransomed and sent home these men having first settled the plan for the execution of their project with the signals which were to be given and observed between them at a distance They then went them selves to Scipio to Syracuse where some of the exiles were and informing him of the promises made by the prisoners inspired probable hopes of success On this the consul despatched Marcus Sergius and Publius Matienus military tribunes the exiles accompanying HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXIX 177 them with orders to lead three thousand men from Rhegium to Locri and for Quintus Pleminius pro pretor to give assistance in the business These set out as commanded carrying scaling ladders fitted to the height of the citadel according to their informa tion and about midnight they gave the signal from the place appointed to those who were to betray that fortress These were prepared and on the watch  and letting down from their side machines made for the purpose received the Romans as they climbed up in several places at once They then fell on the Cartha ginian sentinels who not apprehending any danger were fast asleep their dying groans were the first sound heard A sudden consternation followed as the remainder awoke with a general confusion from being wholly ignorant of the cause of alarm At length the greater part of them being roused from sleep the truth was discovered And now every one called loudly to arms that the enemy were in the citadel that the sentinels were slain The Romans being much in ferior in number would certainly have been over powered had not a shout raised by those who were at the outside of the citadel prevented the garrison from discerning on what side the danger threatened while the darkness of the night aggravated every fear The Carthaginians supposing that the citadel had been sur prised and taken without attempting a contest fled to another fortress not far distant from this The inhabi tants held the city which lay between these strong holds as a prize for the conquerors slight engagements happening every day Quintus Pleminius commanded the Roman Hamilcar the Carthaginian garrison both of whom increased their forces daily by calling in aid from the neighboring places At length Hannibal pre pared to come thither so that the Romans could not have kept their ground had not the principal part of the Locrensians exasperated by the pride and avarice of the Carthaginians inclined to their side 7 As soon as Scipio was informed that the danger increased at Locri and that Hannibal was approach LIV VOL V M 178 LIVY ing he began to fear lest even the garrison might be endangered as it was not easy to retreat from it he therefore left the command at Messana to his brother Lucius Scipio and going on board as soon as the tide turned he let his ships drive with the current On the other hand Hannibal sent forward directions from the river Aleces which is not far from Locri that his party at dawn of day should attack the Romans and Locrensians with their whole force in order that while the attention of all should be turned to the tumult occasioned thereby he might make an unex pected assault on the opposite side of the city When at the first appearance of daylight he found that the battle was begun he did not choose to attempt the citadel in which there was not room had he even gained it for such numbers to act nor had he brought ladders to effect a scalade Ordering therefore the baggage to be thrown together in a heap he drew up his army at a little distance from the walls to terrify the enemy and while all things necessary for the as sault were getting ready he rode round the city with some Numidian horsemen to find out the properest place at which it might be made As he advanced near the rampart the person next to him happened to be struck by a dart from a scorpion he was so terrified at the danger to which he had been exposed that he or dered a retreat to be sounded and fortified his camp far beyond the reach of a weapon The Roman fleet arrived from Messana at Locri while some hours of day remained so that the troops were all landed and brought into the city before sunset Next day the Carthaginians from the citadel began the fight Han nibal now furnished with scaling ladders and every thing proper for an assault was coming up to the walls when on a sudden a gate flying open the Romans rushed out on him when he apprehended nothing less than such an encounter and as the attack was unex pected two hundred of his men were slain The rest Hannibal carried back to the camp as soon as he understood that the consul was there in person and HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXIX 179 sending directions to those who were in the lesser cita del to take care of themselves he decamped by night On which setting fire to the houses there in order to obstruct any operations of the enemy they hastened away as if flying from a pursuit and overtook the main body of their army at the close of day 8 When Scipio saw both citadel and camp de serted by the enemy he summoned the Locrensians to an assembly rebuked them severely for their revolt inflicted punishment on the chief promoters of it and bestowed their effects on the leaders of the opposite faction as a reward for their extraordinary fidelity to wards the Romans As to the community of the Lo crensians he said  he would neither make any grant to them nor take any thing from them Let them send ambassadors to Rome where they would obtain such a settlement of their affairs as the senate should judge reasonable Of this he was confident that though they had deserved harsh treatment from the greatly provoked Romans they would yet enjoy a better state in subjection to them than under their professed friends the Carthaginians Then leaving Quintus Pleminius lieutenant general with the troops which had taken the citadel to defend the city he re turned to Messana with the forces which he had brought from thence The Locrensians after their revolt from the Romans had been treated by the Car thaginians with such haughtiness and cruelty that they could now have endured a lesser degree of seve rity not only with patience but almost with content But in all excesses so much did Pleminius surpass Hamilcar who had commanded their garrison and the Roman soldiers the Carthaginians that there seemed to be a greater emulation between them in vices than in arms Not one of those acts which render the power of a superior odious to the helpless was left unprac tised on the inhabitants by the commander or his troops the roost shocking insults were offered to their persons to their children and to their wives Nor did their avarice refrain even from the plundering of things sa 180 livy cred insomuch that not only the temples were vio lated but even the treasure of Proserpine was seized which through all ages had remained untouched ex cept by Pyrrhus who made restitution of the spoil together with a large atonement for his sacrilege Therefore as at that time the king s ships after being wrecked and shattered had brought nothing safe to land except the sacred money of the goddess so now that same money by a different kind of vengeance in spired with madness all those who were polluted by the robbery of the temple and turned them against each other with hostile fury general against general soldier against soldier 9 Pleminius was governor in chief that part of the soldiers which he had brought with him from Rhe gium was under his own immediate command the rest under military tribunes These tribunes Ser gius and Matienus happened to meet one of Plemi nius soldiers running away with a silver cup which he had taken by force out of the house of a citizen the owners pursuing him on the cup being taken from him by order of the tribunes at first ill language was used then ensued clamor and at length a scuffle between the soldiers of Pleminius and those of the tri bunes The disturbance increasing as any happened to come up to assist their party Pleminius men be ing worsted ran to him in crowds showing their blood and wounds with violent outcries and expressions of resentment and recounting the reproaches that had been thrown on himself which so inflamed him that rushing out of his house and calling the tribunes be fore him he ordered them to be stripped and the rods to be prepared As some time was spent in stripping them for they made resistance and implored aid on a sudden their own soldiers rendered bold by their late success ran together from all parts as if they had been called to arms against an enemy On seeing the persons of the tribunes already injured by the rods they were suddenly seized with such ungovernable rage that without regard either to his dignity or even HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXIX 181 to humanity after having cruelly abused his lictors they assaulted the general himself and having sur rounded and separated him from his party they dread fully mangled him cutting off his nose and ears and leaving him almost without life Accounts of these transactions being carried to Messana Scipio a few days after sailed over to Locri in a ship of six banks of oars and having brought Pleminius and the tri bunes to trial before him he acquitted Pleminius and continued him in the command of the place adjudged the tribunes guilty and threw them into chains that they might be sent to Rome to the senate he then re turned to Messana and went from thence to Syracuse Pleminius giving a loose to his rage because he thought that the injury done him had been treated too lightly by Scipio and that no other person was quali fied to rate the penalty in such a case but he who had suffered the wrong ordered the tribunes to be dragged before him After having made them undergo the ut most degree of torture which the human body is ca pable of enduring he put them to death and not sa tisfied with the punishment thus inflicted he cast them out without burial The like cruelty he used towards the chiefs of the Locrensians who as he heard had complained to Scipio of the treatment they had re ceived at his hands But the extreme severities which he had formerly practised on those allies through lust and avarice he now multiplied through rage and re sentment bringing infamy and detestation not only on himself but on the general also 10 The time of the elections was now drawing near when a letter was brought to Rome from Publius Lici nius the consul stating that he and his army were afflicted with a grievous sickness and that they could not have stood their ground had not the disorder at tacked the enemy with the same or even greater vio lence As therefore he could not come to the elec tions he would if the fathers approved of it nominate Quintus Ccccilius Metellus dictator for the purpose of holding them That it was for the interest of the 182 LIVY state that the army of Quintns Caecilius should be dis banded as it could be of no use at present Hannibal having already retired into winter quarters and be sides so powerful was the distemper in that camp that unless they were speedily separated not one of them probably would survive The senate left it with the consul to determine those matters in such manner as he should judge best for the good of the nation and his own honor The city was at that time suddenly engaged in a consideration respecting religion Fre quent showers of stones having fallen the Sibylline books were on that occasion inspected in which were found certain verses importing that  whensoever a fo reign enemy shall have carried war into the land of Italy he may be expelled and conquered if the Idaean Mother be brought from Pessinus to Rome These verses discovered by the decemvirs affected the se nate the more because the ambassadors who had car ried the offering to Delphi affirmed also that they had performed sacrifice and consulted the Pythian Apollo and that the oracle had answered that the Romans would soon obtain a much greater victory than that which gave them the spoils of which their offering was composed They considered as a confirmation of the same that Scipio s mind was impelled as it were by some presages of an end to the war when he had so earnestly insisted on having Africa for his province In order therefore that they might the sooner ac quire the enjoyment of this triumph portended to them by the fates omens and oracles they set about considering how the goddess might be transported to Rome 11 The Romans were not in alliance with any of the states of Asia However recollecting that jEscu lapius had formerly on occasion of a pestilence been brought from Greece before any connexion with that country that they had already commenced a friend ship with king Attalus on account of their being united in the war against Philip and that he would probably do any thing in his power to oblige the Roman people HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXIX 183 they came to a resolution of sending as ambassadors to him Marcus Valerius Lasvinus who had been twice consul and had commanded in Greece Marcus Cae cilius Metellus who had been pretor Servius Sulpi cius Galba who had been edile and two who had been questors Caius Tremellius Flaccus and Marcus Valerius Falto A convoy of five quiuqueremes was ordered for them that they might appear with suit able grandeur in those countries where they wished to procure a respect for the Roman name The ambassa dors in their way to Asia having landed and gone to Delphi to the oracle inquired what hopes might be entertained of accomplishing the business on which they had been sent they were answered it is said that  they would obtain what they were in search of by means of king Attalus and that when they should have carried the goddess to Rome they were to take care that the best man in the city was the exerciser of the laws of hospitality towards her On coming to the king at Pergamus he received them kindly con ducted them to Pessinus in Phrygia delivered to them the sacred stone which the natives said was the mo ther of the gods and desired them to convey it to Rome Marcus Valerius Falto being sent homeward before the rest brought an account that they were re turning with the goddess and that the best man in Rome must be sought out to pay her the due rites of hospitality Quintus Caecilius Metellus was by the consul in Bruttium nominated dictator for the pur pose of holding the elections and his army was dis banded Lucius Veturius Philo was made master of the horse The elections were held by the dictator the consuls elected were Marcus Cornelius Cethegus and Publius Sempronius Tuditanus the latter absent being employed in the province of Greece The pre tors were then elected Tiberius Claudius Nero Mar cus Marcius Rolla Lucius Scribonius Libo and Mar cus Pomponius Matho As soon as the elections were finished the dictator resigned his office The Roman games were repeated thrice the plebeian seven times 184 LIVY The curule ediles were Cneius and Lucius Cornelius Lentulus Lucius held the province of Spain and being elected while there continued absent during the whole time of his office Tiberius Claudius Asellus and Marcus Junius Pennua were plebeian ediles In that year Marcus Marcellus dedicated the temple of Virtue at the Capuan gate seventeen years after it had been vowed by his father at Clastidium in Gaul during his first consulate Marcus jEmilius Regillus flamen of Mars died that year 12 During the two last years the affairs of Greece had been neglected a circumstance which enabled Philip to reduce the jEtolians thus forsaken by the Romans on whose aid alone they relied They were therefore obliged to sue for and agree to a peace on such terms as the king should impose but had he not used every effort to hasten the conclusion of it Publius Sempronius proconsul who succeeded Sulpicius in the command would have fallen on him while engaged in settling the treaty with ten thou sand foot one thousand horse and thirty five ships of war no small force in support of an ally The peace was scarcely concluded when news was brought to Philip that the Romans had come to Dyrrachium that the Parthinians and other neighboring nations seeing a prospect of changing their situation were in motion and that Dimallum was besieged The Ro mans had turned their operations to that side instead of going forward to the assistance of the jEtolians whither they had been sent provoked at the peace thus made with the king without their concurrence and contrary to the treaty On the receipt of this news Philip fearing lest some greater commotions might arise among the neighboring nations and states pro ceeded by long marches to Apollonia to which place Sempronius had retired after sending his lieutenant general Laetonus with part of the forces and fifteen ships to jEtolia that he might take a view of the situation of affairs and if possible annihilate the compact of that people with the Macedonian Philip HISTORY OF ROME BOOK XXIX J85 laid waste the lands of the Apollonians and marching his forces up to the city offered the Romans battle they however remained quiet only defending the walls while his force was insufficient for laying siege to the place He was yet desirous of concluding a peace with the Romans as with the vEtolians or if that could not be accomplished of obtaining a truce and not choosing to provoke their resentment farther by a new contest he withdrew into his own kingdom At the same time the Epirots wearied by the length of the war having first tried the disposition of the Ro mans sent ambassadors to Philip concerning a general peace affirming that they were very confident it might be brought about if he would come to a confer ence with Publius Sempronius the Roman general They easily prevailed on him to pass into Epirus for the king himself was not averse from the measure There is a city in Epirus called Phoenice  there Philip having conferred with Eropus and Dardas and Philip pre tors of the Epirots had afterwards a meeting with Publius Sempronius Amynander also king of the Athamanians was present at the conference together with other magistrates of the Epirots and Acarnanians Philip the pretor spoke first and intreated both the king and the Roman general to put an end to hostili ties and to consider in a favorable light the liberty which the Epirots took in mediating between them Publius Sempronius dictated the terms of peace â That the Parthinians and Dimallum and Bargulum and Bugenium should be under the dominion of the Romans that Atintania should be ceded to the Mace donian if on sending ambassadors he should obtain it from the senate Peace being agreed to on these terms the king included in the treaty Prusias king of Bithynia the Achaean Boeotians Thessalians Acar nanians and Epirots On the side of the Romans were included the Ilians king Attalus Pleuratus Nabis tyrant of the Lacedaemonians the Eleans Messenians and Athenians The conditions were committed to writing and signed by both parties a 186 LIVY truce being made for two months to allow time for ambassadors to be sent to Rome in order that the people might ratify the whole Every one of the tribes assented to it because having turned their efforts against Africa they wished to be eased for the present from every other enemy When all was settled Publius Sempronius went home to Rome to attend to the duties of his consulship 13 In the consulate of Marcus Cornelius and Pub lius Sempronius which was the fifteenth year of the Punic war A U C 548 B C 204 the provinces were thus decreed â to Cornelius Etruria with the old army to Sempronius Bruttium with power to levy new legions Of the pretors to Marcus Marcius fell the city jurisdiction to Lucius Scribonius Libo the foreign and to the same person Gaul to Marcus Pomponius Matho Sicily and to Tiberius Claudius Nero Sardinia Publius Scipio s command was pro longed for a year with the same army and the same fleet he then had as was also that of Publius Licinius who was ordered to hold Bruttium with two legions as long as the consul should judge it to be for the in terest of the state that he should continue in that pro vince Marcus Livius and Spurius Lucretius also held on their commissions with the two legions with which they had protected Gaul against Mago and likewise Cneius Octavius who after delivering up Sardinia and the legion to Tiberius Claudius was with forty ships of war to defend the sea coast within such limits as the senate should appoint To Marcus Pom ponius pretor in Sicily two legions of the forces that had been at Canua were decreed and it was ordered that of the propretors Titus Quintius and Caius Hos tilius Tubulus the former should hold Tarentum the latter Capua as in the former year each with the old garrison With respect to Spain it was referred to the people to determine on the two proconsuls who should be sent thither when all the tribes agreed in ordering Lucius Cornelius Lentulus and Lucius Man lius Acidinus in quality of proconsuls to hold the HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXIX 187 command of that province in the same manner as they had held it the year before The consuls gave direc tions for a levy of soldiers out of whom they might at once form the new legions for Brnttium and fill up the numbers of the other armies for such were the orders of the senate 14 Africa had not yet been publicly declared a pro vinceâ the senate I suppose keeping the matter se cret lest the Carthaginians should get intelligence of it The city however was filled with sanguine hopes that a decisive blow would soon be struck on that shore and that there would be an end to the Punic war From this cause arose abundance of supersti tious notions and the minds of the people became disposed both to believe and to propagate accounts of prodigies of which a very great number were re ported that two suns had been seen and that in the night time light had suddenly appeared that at Setia a blaze like that of a torch had been observed ex tending from east to west that at Tarracina a gate and at Anagnia both a gate and several parts of the wall had been struck by lightning that in the temple of Juno Sospita at Lanuvium a great noise had been beard succeeded by a dreadful crash For the ex piation of these there was a supplication of one day s continuance and nine days were set apart for reli gious offices on account of a shower of stones that had fallen In addition to these matters they had to consult on the reception to be given to the Ideean mother For besides the account brought by Marcus Valerius one of the ambassadors who had come be fore the rest that the goddess would soon be in Italy a late account had been received that she was at Tar racina The senate also was engaged in the decision of a question of no trifling importanceâ who was the best man in the city A well grounded preference in that point every one would certainly value much more highly than any honors which could be conferred by the votes either of the senate or the people They gave their judgment that Publius Scipio son of 188 LIVY Cneius who bad fallen in Spain a youth who had not yet obtained a questorship was the best of all the good men in Rome If the authors who wrote in the times nearest to this transaction and when the memory of it was fresh had mentioned the particular merits which induced them to make this determination I should gladly have handed down the information to posterity but I will not obtrude any opinion of my own formed as it must be on conjecture when relative to a matter buried in the obscurity of remote antiquity Publius Cornelius was accordingly ordered to repair to Ostia to meet the goddess attended by all the matrons to receive her himself from the ship and then to deliver her to the said matrons to be transported to the city Scipio falling down the river Tiber as had been or dered received the goddess from the priests and con veyed her to the land She was there received by the above mentioned women and who were the principal of the city among whom the name of Claudia Quinta alone has been distinguished for her character as is said having at one time been dubious the share which she had in this solemn act of religion rendered her chastity no longer questionable and she became illus trious among posterity Tlrese relieving each other in succession carried this saving divinity into the temple of Victory on the Palatine hill whilst all the city poured out to meet her censers being placed be fore the doors wherever the procession passed and incense burned in them all praying that she would enter the city with good will and a favorable disposi tion This happened on the day preceding the ides of April and which was appointed a festival The peo ple in crowds carried presents to the goddess and there was a religious feast ordained with games called Megalesian 15 When they came to consider of the supplies for the legions that were in the provinces it was suggested by certain of the senators that there were some things which however they might have been tolerated in times of distress ought not to be any longer endured HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXIX 189 since by the favor of the gods they had been deli vered from the apprehension of danger The attention of the fathers being roused they proceeded to men tion that the twelve Latine colonies which had re fused a supply of soldiers to Quintus Fabius and Quintus Fulvius when consuls enjoyed now for al most the sixth year an immunity from serving in war as if it had been a privilege granted to do them honor and on account of their good conduct while the worthy and dutiful allies in return for their fidelity and obedience had been exhausted by continual levies through the course of many years These words at once recalled to the recollection of the senate a matter which had been almost forgotten and at the same time roused their resentment so that before they suffered the consuls to proceed on any other business they de creed that the consuls should summon to Rome the magistrates and ten principal inhabitants from each of the following colonies so privileged Nepete Su trium Ardsca Cales Alba Carseoli Sara Suessa Circaea Narnia and Interamna and should give them orders that whatever was the greatest number of sol diers which they had separately furnished to the Ro man people at any time since the enemy came into Italy they should now provide to the amount of twice that number of footmen and one hundred and twenty horsemen and if any of them were unable to produce so many horsemen that then they should be allowed to bring three footmen instead of each horseman That both horsemen and footmen should be chosen from among the wealthiest orders and should be sent wherever there was occasion for a supply out of Italy That if any of them should refuse to comply with this requisition it was their pleasure that the magistrates and deputies of that colony should be detained and if they demanded an audience of the senate that it should not be granted them until they had obeyed those injunctions and farther that an annual tax of one ass on every thousand which they possessed should be imposed on them That a survey of persons 190 LIVY and estates should be made in those colonies accord ing to a regulation of the Roman censors which should be the same that was directed for the Roman people and a return of this made at Rome by the censors of the said colonies on their oaths and before they went out of office The magistrates and prin cipal inhabitants of the places in question being sum moned to Rome in pursuance of this decree of the senate and receiving the commands of the consuls re specting the soldiers and the tax they all declared violently against them exclaiming  that it was im possible for them to raise such a number of soldiers they could scarcely accomplish it if their whole pro perty were to be intreated by the regulation They begged and intreated that they might be allowed to appear before the senate and implore a mitigation of their sentence They had been guilty of no crime that deserved to be punished by their ruin but even if they were to be ruined neither their own guilt nor the resentment of the Roman people could make them furnish a greater number of soldiers than they actually had The consuls unmoved ordered the deputies to remain at Rome and the magistrates to go home to make the levies assuring them that  they should have no audience of the senate until they had strictly fulfilled its orders Their hopes of obtaining an au dience being thus cut off the levies were completed without difficulty the number of young men in those colonies being much increased by their having been so long exempt from service 16 Another affair also and which had been almost as long passed over in silence was proposed for con sideration by Marcus Valerius Laevinus who said it was highly reasonable that the several sums of money which had been contributed by private persons when Marcus Claudius and himself were consuls should now be repaid That no one ought to be sur prised at his thus appearing in an affair wherein the public faith was pledged for besides that in some re spect it peculiarly concerned the consul of that year HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXIX 191 in which the money had been advanced he had also been the first adviser of the same on account of the emptiness of the treasury and the inability of the people to pay taxes The senate were well pleased at being reminded of this matter and the consuls being ordered to propose the question decreed that  mo ney should be discharged in three payments that the present consuls should make the first payment imme diately and that the other two instalments should be made by the third and fifth consuls from that time All their cares soon after gave place to one alone when on the arrival of ambassadors they were made acquainted with the grievances of the Locrensians of which until that day they had been ignorant griev ances which greatly disturbed the people who were however less provoked at the villany of Quintus Ple minius than at the partiality or negligence shown in the business by Scipio As the consuls were sitting in the comitium ten ambassadors of the Locrensians in squalid mourning apparel holding out branches of olive the badges of suppliants according to the Grecian custom prostrated themselves on the ground before the tribunal with lamentable cries On in quiring who they were they answered that they were Locrensians who had experienced such treatment from Quintus Pleminius the lieutenant general and his soldiers as the Roman people would not wish even the Carthaginians to suffer and that they requested the favor of being admitted to an audience of the se nate that they might represent to them their deplor able situation 17 An audience being granted the eldest of them spoke to this effect  Conscript fathers I know that it would tend exceedingly to increase the regard which you may think proper to afford to our complaints if you were fully informed of the manner in which Locri was betrayed to Hannibal and also by what means the Carthaginian garrison was expelled and the town re established under your dominion for if the people generally taken were intirely clear of the guilt of the 192 livy revolt and if it also appeared that our return to obe dience and to acknowlegement of your authority was not only voluntary but effected by our own co opera tion and courage you would see the greater indigna tion at such grievous and unmerited injuries being in flicted on good and faithful allies by your lieutenant general and his soldiers But I think it better to de fer the subject of our changes of party to another time and that for two reasons first that it may be discussed in the presence of Publius Scipio who re gained possession of Locri and was a witness of our behavior whether good or bad and secondly that let our conduct have been what it may we ought not to have suffered the evils which have been poured on us We cannot conscript fathers disown that while we had a Carthaginian garrison we suffered many cruelties and indignities as well from Hamilcar the commander there as from the Numidians and Afri cans But what are these when compared with what we this day endure I request conscript fathers that you will hear without being offended what I unwill ingly mention All mankind are in suspense whether they are to see you or the Carthaginians sovereigns of the world Now if an estimation were to be formed of the Roman and Carthaginian governments from the treatment which we of Locri have borne on the one hand and from that which on the other we at this pre sent time bear without remission from your garrison there is no one who would not rather choose Africans than Romans for his masters Yet observe what dis positions the Locrensiaus have notwithstanding shown towards you When we were ill treated by the Car thaginians in a much less degree we had recourse to your general for redress Now when we suffer from your garrison worse than hostile cruelty we have car ried our complaints to no other but to you Conscript fathers you will consider our desperate situation or we are left without any resource for which we can even pray to the immortal gods Quintus Pleminius lieutenant general was sent with a body of troops to HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXIX 193 recover Locri from the Carthaginians and was left with those troops to garrison the town In this your officer conscript fathers the extremity of our mise ries gives me spirit to speak freely there is nothing of a man but the figure and appearance nor of a Ro man citizen but the features the dress and the sound of the Latine language He is a pestilent and savage monster such as fables tell us formerly lay on each side of the strait which divides us from Sicily causing the destruction of mariners If however he had been content with practising his own atrocities alone against us your allies that one gulf however deep we should patiently have filled up As the case at present stands he has made every one of your centurions and soldiers a Pleminius so much does he wish to render licen tiousness and wickedness universal All rob spoil beat wound slay ravish both matrons and virgins while free born children are torn from the embraces of their parents Our city is every day stormed every day plundered all parts of it resound with the lamentations of women and children who are seized and dragged away Whoever knows our sufferings cannot but be surprised that we still subsist under them and that our persecutors are not yet wearied It is neither in my power to recapitulate nor ought you to be troubled with hearing the particulars of our calamities I shall comprise them in general terms I affirm that there is not one house that there is not one man in Locri exempt from injury I affirm that there is no instance of cruelty lust or avarice which has not been put in practice against every one capa ble of being the object of it It is scarcely possible to estimate which was the more lamentable disaster to the city its being taken in war by the enemy or its being crushed under the violence and arms of a tyrant sent to protect it yet bent on its destruction Every evil conscript fathers which cities taken by storm suffer we have suffered and still continue to suffer without remission Every kind of barbarity which the most merciless and unreasonable tyrants practise LIV VOL V N 194 LIVY against their oppressed countrymen has Pleminius practised against us our children and our wives 18 There is one thing conscript fathers concern ing which we are obliged by the regard to religion impressed on our minds both to make a particular complaint and to express our wish that you may think proper so to attend to the same as to free your state from any guilt resulting from it for we have seen with what due solemnity you not only worship your own but even receive foreign deities We have a tem ple of Proserpine of extraordinary sanctity of which probably some account may have reached you during the war with Pyrrhus for in his return from Sicily sailing near Locri with bis fleet among other violent outrages against our city on account of our fidelity to you he plundered the treasures of Proserpine which to that day had ever remained untouched and then putting the money on board bis ships he left the land What was then the result conscript fathers His fleet was next day shattered by a most furious tempest and all the vessels which carried the sacred treasures were thrown on our coasts By the greatness of this calamity that haughty king being at length convinced that there were gods ordered all the money to be searched for collected and carried back to the trea sury of Proserpine Never afterwards was he success ful in any one instance but after being driven out of Italy and having entered Argos inconsiderately by night he fell by an ignoble hand he met a dishonor able death Although your lieutenant general and military tribunes had heard these and many other such things which were not contrived for the purpose of increasing respect to the deity but presented to the observation of our ancestors and selves through the immediate influence of the goddess yet notwithstand ing this I say they dared to lay their impious hands on theireasures till then untouched except in the in stance of Pyrrhus and with the sacrilegious spoil to pollute themselves their families and your armies whose service we beseech you conscript fathers for HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXIX 195 your own sakes for your honor s sake not to employ in any business either in Italy or in Africa until you have first expiated their guilt lest they atone for the crimes which they have committed not by their own blood merely but by some public disaster although even at present the anger of the goddess does not fail to show itself against both your officers and men They have already more than once engaged each other iu pitched battles Pleminius was leader of one party the two military tribunes of the other never did they use their weapons with more eagerness against the Carthaginians than on this occasion  and by their mad proceedings they would have afforded Hannibal an opportunity of recovering the possession of Locri had not Scipio whom we sent for arrived in time to pre vent it It may be said perhaps that the subalterns who had been polluted by the sacrilege were alone agitated with frensy and that no influence of the god dess appeared in punishing the officers whereas in fact it has been here most conspicuous The tribunes were scourged with rods by the lieutenant general afterwards the lieutenant general was treacherously seized by the tribunes and his whole body being mangled and his nose and ears cut off he was left apparently lifeless Recovering from his wounds he threw the military tribunes into chains scourged them made them suffer every kind of torture usually inflicted only on slaves put them to a cruel death and then prohibited them the rites of burial Such penalties has the goddess exacted from the plunderers of her temple nor will she desist from harassing them with every kind of frensy until the sacred money shall be replaced in the treasury Our ancestors being en gaged in a grievous war with the Crotonians intended because this temple lies without the walls to remove the money therein deposited into the city when a voice was heard by night from the shrine command ing them to desist for that the goddess would defend her own treasures This admonition arrested their hands yet when intending to surround the temple 19G LIVY with a wall and which they had raised to some height it suddenly fell down in ruins Thus it is seen that not only now but at several other times the goddess has either secured her own habitationâ her sacred fane or has exacted heavy atonements from those who dared to violate it Our injuries she cannot avenge conscript fathers it can alone be done by you To you and to your honor we fly and as suppliants implore relief For whether you sutler Locri to con tinue under the present lieutenant general and garri son or deliver our countrymen up to Hannibal and the Carthaginians to be punished as their anger may direct it will be equally fatal to them We do not require that you should at once give credit to us and to charges made in the general s absence or with out allowing him to make his defence let him come let him hear them in person let him clear himself of them if he can In fine if there be any act of iniquity which one man can commit against others that he has not committed against us we consent if it be possible again to endure our griefs and that he shall be ac quitted of all guilt towards both gods and men 19 When the ambassadors had concluded their dis course being asked by Quintus Fabius whether they had laid those complaints before Publius Scipio they answered that  an embassy had been sent to him but that he was taken up with the preparations for the war and that either before this time he had passed over into Africa or would do so in a very few days That they had experienced what great interest the lieutenant general had with the commander when after hearing the cause between him and the tribunes he threw the tribunes into chains and left the lieute nant general who was equally guilty or rather more so in possession of the same power as before The ambassadors being ordered to withdraw the principal senators inveighed severely not only against Plemi nins but against Scipio also but above all Quintus Fabius who asserted that he was born for the cor ruption of military discipline that through such con History of rome â book xxix  197 duct he had lost in Spain nearly as many men by mutiny as in war that he both indulged the licen tiousness of the soldiers and let his own passions loose against them in a manner customary only among foreigners and kings To this speech he added a re solution equally harsh that they should pass a vote that Quintus Pieminius lieutenant general be brought to Rome and stand his trial in chains and that if the complaints of the Locrensians should appear to be well founded he should be put to death in prison and his effects confiscated that Publius Scipio on account of his having gone out of his province without an order of the senate should be recalled and that application should be made to the tribunes of the commons to take the sense of the people of the abrogating of his com mission that the Locrensians should be called in and receive this answer from the senate that as to the injuries stated to have been done to them neither the senate nor the people of Rome approved of their being done that they should be complimented with the ap pellations of worthy men allies and friends that their children their wives and whatever else had been taken from them by violence should be restored that a search should be made for the intire money which had been carried off from the temple of Proser pine and that double the sum should be replaced in the treasury that a solemn expiation should be per formed the college of pontiffs being first consulted on this question inasmuch as the sacred treasures had been removed and violated what atonements to what gods and with what victims should they be made that the soldiers who were at Locri should be all transported into Sicily and that four cohorts of allies of the Latine confederacy should be brought to Locri for a garrison The collecting of the votes could not be finished that day the zeal of the parties for and against Scipio rising to a great degree of warmth for besides the crime of Pieminius and the calamities of the Locrensians the general s own manner of living was represented as so far from being Roman that it 198 LIVY was not even military that  he walked in the public place having a cloak and slippers that he gave much of his time to books of entertainment and the schools of exercise and that his whole corps of officers with equal indolence and effeminacy indulged in all the pleasures of Syracuse that Carthage was quite for gotten among them that the whole army debauched and licentious like that at Sucro in Spain or that now at Locri was more formidable to the allies than to the enemy 20 These representations were compounded of a mixture of truth and falsehood yet carrying an ap pearance of the former The opinion of Quintus Me tellus however prevailed who concurring with Maxi mums in the other points dissented from him in that concerning Scipio affirming that it would be the height of inconsistency if the person whom when but a youth the state had some time since made choice of as the only commander capable of recovering Spain whom after he had actually recovered it they had elected consul for the purpose of putting an end to the Punic war and whom they conceived able to draw away Hannibal from Italy and even to subdue Africa â that this man as if he were Quintus Pleminius should be in a manner condemned without a trial and sud denly recalled from his province he repeated were highly inconsistent The abominable facts which the Locrensians complain of are not alleged to have been committed when Scipio was present nor can any thing else be laid to his charge than the having been tender of the lieutenant general either through good nature or respect that it was his opinion that Marcus Pom ponius the pretor to whose lot Sicily had fallen should within the next three days repair to his pro vince that the consuls should choose out of the senate ten deputies whom they should send along with the pretor together with two tribunes of the people and an edile and that with the assistance of this council the pretor should make an inquiry into the affair If it should be found that the oppressions of the Locren HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXIX 199 sians arose from the orders or with the approbation of Publius Scipio that they should then command him to quit the province If Publius Scipio should have al ready passed over into Africa that in such case the tribunes of the commons and the edile with two of the deputies whom the pretor should judge fittest should immediately proceed thither the tribunes and the edile to bring back Scipio from thence the deputies to command the forces until a new general should be appointed But if Marcus Pomponius and the ten deputies should discover that those severities had not been committed either by the order or with the ap probation of Publius Scipio that then Scipio should remain with the army and carry on the war as he had proposed A decree of the senate having passed to this effect application was made to the tribunes of the commons to settle among themselves or choose by lot which two were to go with the pretor and deputies The college of pontiffs was consulted about the expia tions to be performed on account of the spoliation in the temple of Proserpine at Locri Marcus Claudius Marcellus and Marcus Cincius Alimentus tribunes of the commons accompanied the pretor and the ten de puties with whom an edile of the commons was also sent The instructions were that should Scipio whe ther in Sicily or Africa refuse to obey the orders of the pretor the tribunes were to give directions to the edile to apprehend and bring him home under the au thority of their inviolable office It was intended that they should proceed first to Locri and then to Messana 21 Concerning Pleminius there are two different accounts some say that on hearing what had passed at Rome he was going to Naples into exile when he happened to meet Quintus Metellus one of the depu ties and was by him forcibly carried back to Rhegium others that Scipio himself had sent a lieutenant gene ral with thirty of the most distinguished among the cavalry to throw Pleminius into chains and also the principals in the mutiny All these however either by the orders of Scipio before or of the pretor now 200 LIVY were given in charge to the inhabitants of Rhegium to be kept in custody The pretor and deputies proceed ing to Locri applied their first care as they had been directed to the business respecting religion and causing search to be made for all the sacred money appropriated both by Pleminius and the soldiers they replaced it in the treasury together with the sum which they had brought with them performing a solemn ex piation This done the pretor calling the soldiers to gether ordered them to carry the standards out of the city and to form a camp in the plain denouncing by proclamation severe penalties against any one who should either stay behind or carry out with him any thing that was not his own property at the same time authorising the Locrensians to seize whatever belonged to themselves and to search for such of their effects as were concealed above all insisting that the freedom of their persons should be instantly admitted with threats of heavy punishment against any one who should disobey this injunction He then held an assembly of the Lo crensians and told them that the Roman people and the senate restored to them their liberty and their laws That if any one meant to bring a charge against Ple minius or any other person he must follow them to Rhegium or if their state had to prefer a complaint against Publius Scipio as being the author of those crimes which had been perpetrated at Locri against gods and men that they should then send deputies to Rhegium also and that he with the council would there hear their cause The Locrensians returned thanks to the pretor to the deputies and to the senate and people of Rome declaring  that they would pro secute Pleminius that as to Scipio although he had shown but little feeling for the injuries done them yet he was such a man as they would much rather have for their friend than their enemy that they firmly ber lieved the many shocking cruelties which had been practised were neither by the orders or with the ap probation of Publius Scipio who had only given too much credit to Pleminius too little to them that some HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXIX 201 men s natural disposition was such that they showed rather a dislike to the commission of faults than suffi cient resolution to punish them when committed This relieved the pretor and council from a heavy hurden that of inquiring into the conduct of Scipio They con demned Pleminius with thirty two others whom they sent in chains to Rome and then proceeded to Scipio that witnessing all matters they might carry certain information to Rome as to the truth of those reports which had been propagated concerning his manner of living inactivity and total relaxation of military dis cipline 22 While they were on their way to Syracuse Sci pio prepared not words but facts to clear himself of any charges in the remission of duty He ordered all the troops to assemble in that city and the fleet to be got in readiness as if on that day there was to be an engagement with the Carthaginians both on land and sea On the arrival of the commissioners he gave them a kind reception and entertainment and next day showed them both the land and naval forces not only marshalled in exact order but the former per forming their evolutions and the fleet in the harbor exhibiting a representation of a naval combat The pretor and deputies were then led round to take a view of the armories granaries and other warlike prepara tions and with such admiration were they struck of each in particular and of the whole together as to be come thoroughly persuaded that the Carthaginians would be vanquished by that general and that army or by no other They desired him to set out on his voyage with the blessing of the gods and to fulfil as soon as possible the hopes of the Roman people â those hopes which they had conceived on that day when all the centuries concurred in naming him first consul saying this they left the place and with as much joy as if they were to carry to Rome the news of a victory not of a grand preparation for war Ple minius and those who were in the same circumstances with him were on their arrival at Rome immediately LIVY thrown into prison When first produced by the tri bunes the people found no room for mercy prepos sessed as they were by the calamities of the Locren sians However after having been repeatedly brought forward and the odium abating through length of time the public resentment was softened while the maimed condition of Pleminius and the respect they had for Scipio even in his absence conciliated for them some degree of favor Nevertheless Pleminius died in con finement and before his trial was finished Clodius Licinius in the third book of his Roman history re lates indeed that this Pleminius during the votive games which Africanus in his second consulate ex hibited at Rome made an attempt by means of some persons whom he had bribed to set fire to the city in several places that he might have an opportunity of breaking the prison and making his escape and that on the discovery of his wicked design he was com mitted to the dungeon by order of the senate Con cerning Scipio there were no proceedings but in the senate where the encomiums made by all the deputies and the tribunes on that general his fleet and army induced them to vote that be should pass over into Africa as soon as possible with liberty to make his own choice from out the forces then in Sicily which to carry with him and which to leave for the defence of the province 23 During these transactions at Rome the Cartha ginians on their side passed the winter in extreme anxiety They fixed beacons on every promontory kept scouts in incessant motion every messenger filling them with terror They had acquired however an ad vantage of no small moment towards the defence of Africa â an alliance with king Syphax an assistance on which they supposed the Romans to have relied and as being their great inducement to set foot on Africa Hasdrubal son of Gisgo was not only con nected with the king in hospitality as has been men tioned above when he and Scipio happened to come to him at the same time from Spain but mention had been HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXIX 203 also made of an affinity to be contracted between them by the king marrying Hasdrubal s daughter Hasdru bal had gone with a design of completing this business and fixing a time for the nuptials the damsel being now marriageable and finding him inflamed with love for the Nnmidians are beyond all other barba rians inclined to amorous pleasures he sent for her from Carthage and hastened the wedding Among other instances of mutual regard and affection and in order that their private connexion might be cemented by a public one an alliance between the king and the people of Carthage was ratified by oath and their faith reciprocally pledged that they would have the same friends and enemies But Hasdrubal remembered that the king had previously entered into a league with Scipio and knowing how unsteady and changeable were the minds of the barbarians he dreaded lest if Scipio once came into Africa that match might prove a slender tie he therefore seized the opportunity while the warmth of the Numidian s new passion was at the highest and calling to his aid the blandishments of his daughter prevailed on him to send ambassadors into Sicily to Scipio and by them to warn him not to be induced by a reliance on his former promises to pass over into Africa for that he was now united to the people of Carthage both by his marriage with a citizen of that state daughter of Hasdrubal whom he had seen entertained in his house and also by a public treaty He recommended it strongly to the Romans to carry on the war against the Carthaginians at a dis tance from Africa as they had hitherto done lest he might be under a necessity of interfering in their disputes and of joining one or the other while he wished to decline taking part with either If Scipio should enter Africa and advance his army towards Carthage he must then of necessity fight as well in defence of the country wherein he himself was born as in support of the native city of his spouse her parent and household gods 24 The ambassadors charged with these dispatches 204 LivY from the king to Scipio had an interview with him at Syracuse Scipio though disappointed in a matter of the utmost consequence to the success of his affairs in Africa and in the high expectations which he had en tertained from that quarter sent back the ambassadors speedily before their business should become publicly known and gave them a letter for the king in which he conjured him in the most forcible terms not  to violate the laws of hospitality nor the alliance which he had concluded with the Roman people nor justice nor faith their right hands pledged nor act in any thing offensive to the gods the witnesses and guaran tees of compacts The coming of the Numidians was generally known for they had walked about the city and had been frequently at the pretorium  so that it was feared should the subject of their embassy transpire that the troops might become alarmed at the prospect of being to fight against Syphax and the Carthaginians Scipio judged it prudent therefore to divert their thoughts from the truth by prepossessing them with false informations Calling them to an assembly he said that there was no room for longer delay that the kings their allies pressed him to pass over to Africa immediately That Masinissa had before come in person to Laelius complaining of time being wasted in inactivity and that Syphax now sent dispatches to the like effect requiring that either the troops should at length be carried over to Africa or if the plan was changed that he should be made ac quainted with it in order that he might adopt such measures as would be convenient to himself and beneficial to his kingdom Since therefore every preparation had been made and as the business ad mitted no longer hesitation it was his intention after bringing over the fleet to Lilybaeum and assembling at that place all the forces of horse and foot to pass into Africa with the favor of the gods the first day on which the ships could sail He sent a letter to Marcus Pomponius to come to that port in order that they might consult together as to what particular legions HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXIX 205 and what number of men he should carry to Africa with orders also to all the sea coast that the ships of burden should be all seized and brought thither When the troops and vessels had assembled at Lily baeum neither could the city contain the men nor the harbor the ships and such an ardent desire to pass into Africa possessed them all that they appeared not as if going to be employed in war but in receiving the rewards of victory already secured especially those of the army of Cannae for they expected by exerting themselves on the present occasion and under the then general to put an end to their ignominious ser vice Scipio showed not the least inclination to re ject soldiers of that description knowing that the mis fortune at Cannae had not arisen from their want of spirit and that besides there were none in the Ro man army who had served so long or who had ac quired so much experience both in a variety of battles and in attacking towns The legions of Cannse were the fifth and sixth After giving notice that he would carry these to Africa he reviewed them man by man and leaving behind such as he thought unfit for the service he substituted in their places those whom he had brought from Italy and filled up those legions in such a manner that each contained six thousand two hundred foot and three hundred horse the horse and foot of the allies of the Latine confederacy he chose also out of the army of Cannae 25 Authors differ widely with regard to the number of men carried over to Africa In one I find ten thousand foot and two thousand two hundred horse in another sixteen thousand foot and one thousand six hundred horse while others augment them more than half and assert that thirty five thousand horse and foot were put on board the ships Some have not stated the numbers and among these as the matter is uncertain I choose to place myself Coelius indeed avoids specifying the same but he magnifies to an im mense extent the idea that he gives of their multitude he tells us that birds fell to the ground stunned by the 206 LIVY shouts of the soldiers and that it might have been well imagined that there was not a man left hehind either in Italy or in Sicily Scipio took on himself the charge of embarking the men in a regular manner The sea men were kept in order on board the ships by Caius Laelius who had the command of the fleet The care of shipping the stores was allotted to Marcus Pompo nius the pretor A quantity of food sufficient for forty five days was put on board as much of it ready dressed as would serve for fifteen days When all were em barked the general sent round boats to bring the pilots and masters with two soldiers out of each ship to the forum to receive orders Being there assembled he first inquired whether they had put water on board for men and cattle and for as many days as they had corn they answered that there was water on board for forty five days He then charged the soldiers that attentive to their duty they should behave themselves quietly so that the seamen might perform their busi ness without interruption informed them that he and Lucius Scipio with twenty ships of war would protect the transports on the right division  and Caius Laalius commander of the fleet and Marcus Porcius Cato the quest or with the same number those on the left that the ships of war would carry each a single light the transports two that the signal by night on board the ship of the commander in chief would consist of three lights The pilots had orders to steer to Emporium where the land is remarkably fertile consequently the country abounds with plenty of all things The inhabitants are unwarlike as is generally the case where the soil is rich and Scipio supposed that they might be overpowered before succor could arrive from Carthage Having issued these orders he commanded them to return to their ships and on the signal being given next day with the favor of the gods to set sail 26 Many Roman fleets had sailed from Sicily and from that same harbor but never did any equipment afford so grand a spectacle either in the present war HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXIX 207 which was not surprising as most of these fleets had only gone in quest of plunder or even in any former one And yet his force could not be fully estimated from a view of the present armament for not only two consuls with their armies had passed from thence be fore but there had been almost as many war vessels in their fleets as there were transports attending Scipio These it is true were not less than four hundred but of ships of battle he had only fifty But the Romans had more alarming apprehensions from one war than from the other from the second than from the former as well by reason of its being waged in Italy as of the dreadful destruction of so many armies together with their commanders Scipio however had attracted an extraordinary degree of attention He had acquired a high degree of renown partly by his bravery partly by the happy success which had attended it and which gave room to expect from him the most glorious achievements Besides the very object proposed of passing into the enemy s country which had not been attempted by any general during that war strongly roused men s feelings for he had on all occasions publicly declared that his intention was to draw Han nibal away from Italy to transfer the war to Africa and to finish it there Not only the whole of the in habitants of Lilybaeum crowded together to the harbor to get a view of them but also deputies from all parts of Sicily who came for the purpose of showing that mark of respect not only to Scipio but to Marcus Pomponius pretor of the province The legions like wise which were to be left on the island quitted their quarters in compliment to their fellow soldiers In a word the fleet exhibited a grand prospect to those on land and the land to those on ship board it being covered all round with the admiring multitude 27 As soon as day appeared a herald having com manded silence Scipio in the admiral s ship spoke thus Ye gods and goddesses who preside over the seas and lands I pray and beseech you that whatever affairs have been carried on or shall hereafter be car 208 LIVY ried on during my command may all conduce to the happiness of myself the stale and people of Rome of the allies and the Latine confederates who follow my party command and auspices and those of the Roman people on sea on land and on rivers Lend your favorable aid to all those measures and farther them by happy advancements bring us all home unhurt and victorious decorated with spoils laden with booty and exulting in triumph Grant us the opportunity of taking vengeance on our foes and whatever attempts the Carthaginian people have made to injure our state grant to me and to the Roman people power to re taliate the same evils on the state of Carthage After these prayers he threw into the sea according to cus tom the raw entrails of a victim which had been slain and gave by a trumpet the signal for sailing The wind being favorable and blowing fresh when they set sail they were soon carried out of sight of land but about noon a fog arose which made it difficult to keep the ships from running foul of each other As they ad vanced into the open sea the wind abated during the following night the haziness continued but at the rising of the sun it was dispersed and the wind fresh ened The pilot soon after told Scipio that  Africa was not above five miles distant that he saw the pro montory of Mercury and that if he gave orders to steer thither the whole fleet would be immediately in harbor As soon as Scipio came within sight of land he prayed to the gods that his seeing Africa might be happy for the state and for himself he then gave orders to make sail for another landing place They proceeded with the same wind  but a fog arising as on the day before hid the land from their sight and in creasing as the night came on involved every object in obscurity They therefore cast anchor lest the ships should run foul of each other or be driven on shore At daybreak however the wind sprung up dispersed the fog and discovered the coast of Africa Scipio inquiring the name of the nearest promontory and being told that it was called Cape Fair said the HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXIX 209 omen is pleasing steer your ships thither The fleet ran down accordingly and all the forces were disem barked I am inclined to follow the accounts of very many Greek and Latin authors which are that the voyage was prosperous and without danger or con fusion Coelius alone except that he does not repre sent the ships as being lost gives a narration of every other dreadful occurrence which could be occasioned by wind or waves that at last the fleet was driven from Africa to the island jEgimurus  that from thence with difficulty they recovered their course and that the men had without orders from the general escaped to land in boats from the almost foundering vessels just in short as from a shipwreck without arms and in the utmost disorder 28 The troops being landed formed their camp on the nearest rising grounds The sight of the fleet with the bustle of landing spread consternation and terror not only through the parts adjoining the sea but even among the cities for not only crowds of women and children mixing with the bands of men filled up all the roads but the country people also drove their cattle before them so that it seemed as if they were all at once forsaking Africa Those caused much greater terror in the cities than they had felt themselves par ticularly at Carthage where the tumult was almost as great as though the enemy were at its gates for since the consulate of Marcus Attilius Regulus and Lucius Manlius a space of nearly fifty years they had seen no Roman army except those predatory squadrons from which some troops had made descents on the ad joining coast seizing whatever chance threw in their way but who had always made a hasty retreat to their ships and before the peasantry had taken the alarm for this reason the consternation and panic was now the greater and in fact they had neither a powerful army at home nor a general whom they could oppose to the invaders Hasdrubal son of Gisgo was by far the first person in the city not only in character and wealth but also by reason of his affinity with the king liv vol v o 210 LIVY They considered howeveT that he had been vanquished and put to flight in several battles in Spain by this same Scipio and that as a commander he was no more to be equalled with the Roman general than their tumultuary forces were with the Roman army The people were therefore called to arms as though Scipio were ready to attack the city the gates were hastily shut armed men placed on the walls and watches and outposts fixed together with a regular guard during the following night Next day five hundred horsemen who were despatched to gain in telligence and to disturb the enemy on their landing fell in with the advanced guards of the Romans for Scipio having sent his fleet to Utica and proceeded to some distance from the coast had seized on the next high grounds placing outposts of cavalry in proper places and sending others into the country to plunder 29 These having met with the Carthaginian horse men slew a small number of them in fight and the greater part of the remainder as they pursued them flying among whom was Hanno their commander a young man of distinction Scipio not only laid waste the country round but captured also a very wealthy city which lay near him in which besides other things which were immediately put on board the transports and sent to Sicily there were taken of freemen and slaves not less than eight thousand But what gave the Romans the greatest joy on the com mencement of their operations was the arrival of Masinissa who came according to some with no more than two hundred horsemen but most authors say with two thousand Now as he was by far the great est of all the kings of that age and performed the most important services to the Roman state it appears worth while to digress a little in order to relate the great vicissitudes of fortune which he experienced in the loss and recovery of his father s kingdom While he was fighting on the side of the Carthaginians in Spain his father whose name was Gala died the kingdom HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXIX 211 according to the custom of the Numidians came to the king s brother iEsalces who was far advanced in years In a short time after jEsalces also dying Capusa the elder of his two sons the other of whom was very young got possession of his father s dominions but his title being supported more by the regard paid to the right of descent than from any respect to his cha racter or any strength which he possessed there stood forth a person called Mezetulus related by blood in some degree to the royal family His progenitors however had always opposed their interests and their issue had with various success disputed the throne with the branch then in possession This man having roused his countrymen to arms among whom his in fluence was great by reason of their dislike to the reigning dynasty levied open war so that the king was obliged to take the field and fight for the crown In that battle Capusa fell together with a great number of the principal men of the kingdom while the whole nation of the Massylians submitted to the dominion and government of Mezetulus He did not however assume the regal title but satisfied with the modest one of Protector gave the name of king to the boy Lacumaces the surviving son of him whom he had slain In hopes of procuring an alliance with the Car thaginians he took to wife a Carthaginian woman of distinction daughter of Hannibal s sister formerly married to king jEsalces and sending ambassadors to Syphax renewed with him an old connexion of hospi tality endeavoring by all these measures to secure a support against Masiuissa 30 On the other hand Masinissa hearing that bis uncle was dead and afterwards that his cousin german was slain came over from Spain into Mauritania The king of the Moors at that time was Bocchar applying to him as a suppliant he obtained by the humblest in treaties four thousand Moors to escort him on his journey not being able to prevail for any aid in the war When he arrived with these on the frontiers of the kingdom as he had before despatched messengers 212 LIVY to his own and his father s friends about five hundred Numidians assembled about him He then sent back the Moors according to his engagement and although the numbers that joined him were short of his expecta tions and not such as might encourage him to under take an affair of moment yet believing that by enter ing on action and making some effort he should gather strength for a more important enterprise he threw himself in the way of the young king Lacumaces as he was going to Syphax at Thapsus The attendants of Lacumaces flying back in consternation Masinissa took the city at the first assault received the submission of some of the king s party who surrendered and slew others who attempted to resist but the greatest part of them with the boy himself escaped during the tumult to Thapsus whither they had at first intended to go The success of Masinissa in this small exploit and on the first commencement of his operations drew the regards of the Numidians towards him while the old soldiers of Gala flocked from all parts of the coun try and the towns inviting the young prince to proceed to the recovery of his father s kingdom Mezetulus was superior in number of men for besides the army with which he had conquered Capusa he was strength ened by some troops who had submitted after the king was slain  the boy Lacumaces having likewise brought succors from Syphax Mezetulus had fifteen thousand foot ten thousand horse with whom Masinissa engaged in battle though much inferior in number The valor however of the veteran soldiers prevailed aided by the skill of their leader who had gained experience in the war between the Romans and Carthaginians The young king with his guardian and a small body of Massylians escaped into the territories of the Cartha ginians Masinissa thus recovered his father s throne yet foreseeing that he should have a much more severe struggle to maintain against Syphax he thought it best to come to a reconciliation with his cousin ger man Proper persons were accordingly sent to give Lacumaces hopes that if he put himself under the pro HISTORY OF ROME 213 â BOOK XXIX tection of Masinissa he should enjoy the same honor able provision which jEsalces had formerly known under Gala and to assure Mezetulus not only of im punity but of an intire restitution of all his property As they both preferred a moderate share of fortune at home to exile he brought them over to his side not withstanding the Carthaginians used every means to prevent it 31 During these transactions Hasdrubal happened to be with Syphax and when the Numidian seemed to think that it was of little consequence to him whe ther the government of the Massylians were in the hands of Lacumaces or of Masinissa he told him that  he would be greatly mistaken in supposing that Ma sinissa would be content with the acquisitions which had satisfied bis father Gala or his uncle yEsalces That he was possessed of much greater spirit and un derstanding than had ever appeared in any of his race that he had often in Spain exhibited both to his allies and enemies instances of such courage as is very rarely seen that both Syphax and the Carthaginians unless they smothered that rising name would soon be enve loped in a general conflagration when it would not be in their power to help themselves that as yet his strength was infirm and might be easily broken while he was endeavoring to heal the divisions of his kingdom By such kind of arguments Syphax was induced to lead an army to the frontiers of the Massy lians into a district about which there had often been not only verbal disputes but battles fought with Gala and there to pitch his camp as if it were his acknow leged property alleging that if any opposition were made which was what was most to be wished he would have an opportunity of fighting but if the dis trict were abandoned through fear he should then pro ceed into the heart of the kingdom that the Massy lians would either submit to his authority without a contest or at all events would be unable to contend with him Stimulated by such discourses Syphax made war on Masinissa and in the first encounter 214 LIVY routed and dispersed the Massylians Masinissa fled from the field attended only by a few horsemen to a mountain which the natives call Balbus A number of families with their tents and cattle which is all their wealth followed their king the rest of the Massy lians submitted to Syphax The mountain of which the fugitive took possession abounds with grass and water and as it was thus well adapted to the grazing of cattle it supplied abundance of food to feed men living on flesh and milk Excursions from henee were made through all the neighboring parts at first secretly and by night afterwards openly The lands of the Car thaginians suffered most because there was greater plenty of spoil there than among the Numidians and it was carried off with less danger At length they be came so bold as to carry down their booty to the sea and sell it to merchants who brought their ships thi ther for the purpose and on these occasions greater numbers of the Carthaginians were slain and made prisoners than often happens in a regular engagement On this subject the Carthaginians made heavy com plaints to Syphax earnestly pressing him to crush this remnant of the foe To this he was himself well in clined but thought it rather beneath the dignity of a king to pursue a vagrant robber as he styled him through the mountains 32 Bocchar a spirited and enterprising general was chosen by the Numidian for that employment Four thousand foot and two thousand horse were given him with a promise of immense reward if he should bring back the head of Masinissa or rather if be should take him alive for that the latter would be to him a matter of inexpressible joy Falling unex pectedly on Masinissa s men when they were scat tered about and off their guard and who were in con siderable numbers he shut them out together with their cattle from the protection of those who were in arms driving Masinissa himself with his few fol lowers to the summit of the mountain On this con sidering the war as nearly finished he sent to the king HISTORY OF ROME BOOK XXIX 215 both the booty of cattle and the prisoners and also a part of his forces which were more numerous than the remainder of the business required Then with no more than five hundred foot and two hundred horse pursuing Masinissa who had gone down from the top of the mountain he shut him up in a narrow valley securing the entrance at each end Great slaughter was there made of the Massylians Masinissa with not more than fifty horsemen effected a retreat through the intricate passes of the mountain with which the pursuers were unacquainted Bocchar however closely followed his steps and overtaking him in au open plain near the city Clupea surrounded him in such a manner that he slew every one of his fol lowers except four horsemen Masinissa with these and after receiving a wound slipped out of his hands as it were during the tumult Their flight was in full view a body of horse being spread over the whole plain some of whom pursued these five remaining enemies while others in order to meet them pushed across their route A large river lay in the way of the fugitives into which they plunged their horses with out hesitation being pressed by greater danger from behind Hurried away by the current they were car ried down obliquely and two of them being swal lowed by its violent rapidity in sight of the enemy they believed that Masinissa himself had perished but with the two other horsemen he landed among some bushes on the farther bank This put an end to Bocchar s pursuit for he durst not venture into the river and besides he was persuaded that the object of it no longer existed he therefore returned to the king with the ill grounded report of Masinissa s death Messengers were despatched with the joyful news to Carthage though in its spread over Africa men s minds were variously affected by it Masinissa while healing his wounds by the application of herbs and in a secret cave lived for several days on what the two horsemen procured by pillage As soon as it was cicatrised and he thought himself able to bear the mo 216 livy tion he set out again with wonderful resolution to make another effort for the recovery of his kingdom He collected in his way not more than forty horse men but as soon as he arrived among the Massy lians and made himself known to them they were so powerfully actuated both by their former affection and the unhoped for joy at seeing him in safety whom they believed to have perished that in a few days six thousand armed foot and four thousand horse repaired to his standard and he not only got possession of his father s kingdom but laid waste the countries in al liance with the Carthaginians and the frontiers of the Masaesylians the dominion of Syphax Having thus provoked the Numidians to war he took post between Cirtha and Hippo on the tops of mountains in a situation convenient for all his purposes 33 Syphax thinking this an affair of too much im portance to he intrusted to the management of his generals sent a part of his army with his son Ver mina then a youth with orders to march round in a circuit and fall on the enemy s rear when he himself should have attracted their attention to his side Ver mina set out by night so as to be concealed until he should begin the attack but Syphax decamped in the day and marched openly as he was to engage in a regular pitched battle When he thought that suffi cient time had been allowed for those who had been sent round to have arrived at their station he led his forces by a gentle acclivity directly up the mountain for he relied both on his numbers and the ambuscade which he had prepared on his enemy s rear Masi nissa on the other side drew up his men depending chiefly on the advantage of the ground although had it been much less in his favor he would not have de clined the fight The battle was furious and for a long time doubtful Masinissa being favored by his situation and the bravery of his men Syphax by his numbers which were more than abundant This great multitude being divided one part pressed on in front while the other part surrounded the rear which gave HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXIX 217 a decided victory to Syphax nor was there even room for the enemy to escape inclosed as they were on both sides the rest therefore horse and foot were either slain or taken Masinissa collected round himself in close order about two hundred horsemen whom he divided into three squadrons with orders to break through the enemy having appointed a place where they should reassemble after being separated in their flight He himself made his way through the midst of their weapons as he had proposed the other two squadrons failed in the attempt one surrendering through fear the other after a more obstinate resist ance being overwhelmed with darts and cut to pieces Vermina followed close on the steps of Masinissa who baffled him by frequently turning out of one road into another and whom he at length obliged harassed with extreme fatigue to desist from the pursuit and ar rived himself with sixty horsemen at the lesser Syrtis There with the honorable consciousness of having often attempted the recovery of his father s kingdom lie rested until the coming of Caius Laelius and the Roman fleet to Africa between the Carthaginian Em poria and the nation of the Garamantians From these circumstances I am inclined to believe that Masinissa came afterwards to Scipio rather with a small body of forces than a large one for the very great number which has been mentioned by some suits the condition of a king on a throne the smaller that of an exile 34 The Carthaginians having lost a large party of horse together with their commander made up ano ther body of cavalry by a new levy and gave the com mand of it to Hanno son of Hamilcar They sent frequently for Hasdrubal and Syphax by letters and messengers and at length by ambassadors Hasdru bal was ordered to come to the aid of his native city which was threatened with a siege while Syphax was intreated to bring relief to Carthage and to atl Africa Scipio was at that time near Utica above five miles from the city having removed from the sea coast where for a few days he had a camp adjoining the 218 LIVY fleet Hanno having received the newly raised body of cavalry which so far from being strong enough to make any attempt on the enemy was not even suffi cient to protect the country from devastation made it his first care to increase their number by pressing Those of other nations were not rejected but he col lected mostly N umidians who are by far the best horse men in Africa Having got together four thousand horse he took up his quarters in a city called Salera fifteen miles from the Roman camp When this was told to Scipio he said with surprise  What cavalry lodg ing in houses during the summer Let them be even more in number while they have such a commander The less they showed of activity the less time he thought should be lost by himself he therefore sent forward Masinissa with the cavalry giving them di rections to ride up to the gates and entice the enemy out to battle That when their multitudes should pour out and become too powerful in the contest he should give way by degrees and that he would him self come up in time to support the fight When the advanced party had as he supposed effected his pur pose he followed with the Roman horse and pro ceeded without being observed under cover of some rising grounds which lay very conveniently round the windings of the road Masinissa according to the plan laid down acted at one time as if threatening an assault at another as if seized with fear now riding up to the very gates and now retreating with dissem bled haste which gave such boldness to the enemy that they were at length tempted to come out of the town and pursue him with disorder in his counter feited flight All however had not come forth and with these remaining numbers the commander was not a little perplexed Some overpowered with wine and sleep he had to compel to the taking of arms others he had to stop who were running out by the gates without their standards and in scattered parties wholly regardless of order or ranks Masinissa with stood them at first while they rushed rashly to the HISTORY OF ROME BOOK XXIX 219 charge but soon after greater numbers pouring out and their whole force of cavalry joining in the conflict they could no longer be resisted Yet Masinissa did not betake himself to a hasty flight but retired lei surely until he drew them on to the hills which con cealed the Roman cavalry These immediately rising up their strength unimpaired and their horses fresh spread themselves round Hanno and the Africans who were fatigued in the pursuit and Masinissa suddenly wheeling about returned to the charge About one thousand who composed the first division and who could not easily retreat were together with Hanno the commander surrounded and slain the rest terri fied principally by the death of their general fled in confusion and were pursued for thirty miles by the conquerors who took or slew two thousand more of the cavalry It appeared that there were among the9e not less than two hundred Carthaginian horsemen several of them of the richest and most distinguished families 35 It happened that the same day on which this battle was fought the ships which had carried the booty to Sicily returned with stores as if they had foreseen that they were to bear away another cargo as before All writers do not mention two generals of the Carthaginians of the same name being slain in two battles of the cavalry apprehending I suppose that there was a mistake occasioned by the same fact being related twice Nay Coelius and Valerius even assert that Hanno was taken prisoner Scipio made presents to the officers and horsemen according to the behavior of each and above all he paid extraordinary honors to Masinissa Having placed a strong garrison in Salera he set out with the rest of the army and not only laid waste the country wherever he marched but also took some cities and towns and thereby widely diffused the terror of his arms Scipio returned to the camp on the seventh day after he had left it bring ing with him a great number of men and cattle and a vast quantity of plunder He then dismissed the 220 livy ships heavily laden a second time with all kinds of spoil From that time laying aside small expeditions and predatory excursions he turned the whole force of the war to the siege of Utica intending if he should take it to establish his head quarters there for the future in order to the better execution of the rest of his designs While the marine forces made their approaches on that side of the city which is washed by the sea those of the land advanced from a rising ground hanging almost over the walls Engines and machines had been sent from Sicily with the stores and many were made in the armory where a number of artificers skilled in such works were retained for the purpose The people of Utica attacked on all sides by such a powerful force had no hopes but from the Car thaginians nor the Carthaginians any but from Has drubal and from him only as he should be able to in fluence Syphax But all measures proceeded too slowly for their anxious desire of aid of which they stood so much in need Hasdrubal though he had by the most diligent press made up the number of thirty thousand foot and three thousand horse yet durst not move to wards the camp of the enemy before the arrival of Sy phax Syphax soon came with fifty thousand foot and ten thousand horse and immediately decamping from Carthage sat down at a small distance from Utica and the intrenchments of the Romans Their approach pro duced at least this consequence that Scipio after hav ing besieged Utica for near forty days and tried every expedient for its reduction in vain was obliged to retire from it as the winter was now at hand He fortified his winter camp on a promontory joined to the continent by a narrow isthmus and which stretches out to some length into the sea and included the naval camp within the same intrenchment The le gions were stationed on the middle of the isthmus the ships were hauled on shore and the seamen occu pied the coast which faces the north the cavalry a valley on the south Such were the transactions in Africa to the latter end of autumu HISTORY OF ROME â 221 BOOK XXIX 36 Various stores were imported from Sicily and Italy and besides the corn collected from all quarters of the adjacent country Cneius Octavius propretor brought a vast quantity out of Sardinia from Tiberius Claudius the pretor in consequence of which not only the granaries already built were filled but new ones were erected Clothing was wanted for the troops that matter was given in charge to Octavius with di rections to apply to the pretor and to try if any could be procured by him a business which he carefully attended to for in a short time twelve hundred gowns and twelve thousand jackets were sent During the same summer in which these things passed in Africa Publius Sempronius consul who had the province of Bruttium on his march in the district of Croton engaged Hannibal in a tumultuary battle or rather a kind of skirmishing The Romans were worsted and one thousand two hundred of the consul s army slain The rest returned in confusion to the camp which however the enemy did not dare to assault During the silence of the following night Sempronius marched away and having sent directions to Pub lius Licinius proconsul to bring up his legions he made a junction of their forces thus two commanders and two armies returned on Hannibal Neither party declined an engagement the consul deriving confi dence from his forces being doubled the Carthagi nian from his late victory Sempronius led up his own legions into the first line those of Licinius were placed in reserve In the beginning of the battle the consul vowed a temple to Fortuna Primigenia if he should defeat the enemy on that day and the object of his vow was accomplished The Carthaginians were routed and put to flight above four thousand fell somewhat less than three hundred were made prisoners with whom were taken forty horses and eleven military standards Hannibal dismayed by this overthrow drew oft his army to Croton At the same time Marcus Cornelius consul not so much by force of his arms as by the terror of his judicial pro 222 LIVY ceedings kept Etruria in obedience though it was almost intirely devoted to Mago and to the hope of obtaining by his means a change of government The inquisitions directed by the senate he executed with the utmost impartiality and many of the Tuscan no bles who had either gone themselves or sent deputies to Mago about the revolt of their states stood trial and were found guilty Others from a consciousness of guilt went into voluntary exile and by thus with drawing though condemned in their absence could suffer only in a confiscation of their effects 37 While the consuls were thus employed in diffe rent parts the censors at Rome Marcus Livius and Cains Claudius called over the list of the senate Quintus Fabius Maximus was again chosen principal seven were disgraced not one however of those who had sat in the curule chair The orders for repairing public buildings were enforced with the greatest strict ness A road was contracted for to be made from the ox market to the temple of Venus with public seats and a temple to be built for the Great Mother on the Palatine hill A new tax from the sale of salt was established This article had been sold at the sixth part of an ass both at Rome and in all parts of Italy and it was now directed to be supplied at the same rate at Rome at a higher in the country towns and mar kets and at various prices in different places People were firmly persuaded that Livius had contrived this tax in resentment and on account of a sentence hav ing been formerly passed on him which he had consi dered as unjust and that in fixing the price of salt the greatest burden had been laid on those tribes by whose influence he had been condemned hence the surname of Salinator was given to him The lustrum was closed later than usual because the censors sent persons through all the provinces to bring them a re turn of the number of Roman citizens in each of the armies Including these there were rated in the sur vey two hundred and fourteen thousand men Caius Claudius Nero had the honor of closing the lustrum HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXIX 223 The senate then received a survey of twelve colonies presented by the censors of those colonies which had never been done before in order that records might appear in the public archives of their proportion of strength both in men and money The review of the knights then began and it so happened that both the censors had a horse at the public expense When they came to the Pollian tribe in which was inrolled the name of Marcus Livius and whom the herald hesi tated to cite Nero called to him Cite Marcus Li vius and being actuated either by some remains of their old enmity or by an unseasonable affectation of strictness he ordered Livius to sell his horse because he had been condemned by a sentence of the people In like manner Marcus Livius when they came to the Narnian tribe in which the name of his colleague ap peared he ordered him to dispose of his horse for two reasons one that he had given false evidence the other that he had not been sincere in his recon ciliation with him Thus they became engaged in a scandalous contest each aspersing the character of the other though at the same time he injured his own On going out of their office of censor when Caius Claudius had taken the oath respecting the observance of the laws and had gone up to the treasury among the names of those whom he left disfranchised in the treasury list he gave in the name of his associate Marcus Livius also came thither and except the Me tian tribe which had neither concurred in his con demnation nor in appointing him consul or censor he left the whole Roman people thirty four tribes dis franchised in the treasury list and this he said he did because they had not only condemned him when innocent but had elected him while under the said sentence both consul and censor so that they could not deny that they had been guilty either of one great fault in giving their sentence or of two in the elec tions He added that Caius Claudius would be in cluded in the list among the thirty four tribes but that if there had been any precedent of inserting any 224 LIVY person twice in the treasury list he would have in serted his name particularly The contest between the censors thus mutually reproaching each other was shameful while the rebuke given to the giddi ness of the people was highly becoming a censor and the strict principles of that age The censors having fallen into disrepute Cneius Baebius tribune of the people thinking that their situation afforded him an opportunity of gaining notice summoned them both to a trial before the people but the senate interfered and stopped any farther proceedings lest the office af censor should in future be subjected to the humor of the populace 38 During the same summer the consul took Clam petia in Bruttium by storm Consentia and Pandosia with other towns of small consequence surrendered voluntarily and as the time of the elections drew near it was thought more expedient to call home Cor nelius from Etruria where there was no employment for his arms He elected Cneius Servilius Caapio and Cneius Servilius Geminus The election of the pre tors was then held there were chosen Cneius Corne lius Lentulus Publius Quintilius Varus Publius jElius Partus and Publius Villius Tappulus al though the two latter were ediles of the commons The consul as soon as the elections were over returned into Etruria to his army The priests who died that year and those who were substituted in the places of others were Tiberius Veturius Philo flamen of Mars elected and inaugurated in the room of Marcus JEmi lius Regillus deceased the year before In the room of Marcus Pomponius Matho augur and decemvir were elected as decemvir Marcus Aurelius Cotta as augur Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus who was then very young an instance in those times extremely rare in the disposal of a priest s office Golden cha riots with four horses were that year placed in the capitol by the curule ediles Caius Livius and Mar cus Servilius Geminus The Roman games were re peatedly exhibited for two days In like manner the HISTORY OF HOME BOOK XXX 225 plebeian for two days by the ediles Publius jEHus and Publius Villius There was also a feast of Jove on occasion of the games BOOK XXX Chap 1 Cneius Servilius C pio and Cains Servi lius Geminus in the sixteenth year of the Punic war A U C 549 B C 203 consulted the Senate on the state of public affairs the war and the provinces The senate decreed that the consuls should decide between themselves or determine by lot which of them should hold the province of Bruttium and act against Hannibal and which that of Etruria and Li guria That he to whose lot Bruttium fell should re ceive the army from Publius Sempronius late consut That Publius Sempronius to whom the command was continued as proconsul for a year should succeed Publius Licinius who was to come home to Rome This commander bad now acquired a high reputation for military skill in addition to his other excellent qualifications of which no citizen at that time pos sessed such an abundance nature and fortune con spiring to confer on him every thing valuable in man He was of a noble race and possessed great wealth he excelled in personal beauty and strength of body he was esteemed the most eloquent of his time whe ther he pleaded in the courts of justice or enforced or opposed any measure either in the senate or be fore the people and was besides remarkably skilled in the pontifical law In addition to all these the con sulship enabled him to acquire fame in the field The same method of proceeding which the senate had de liv vol v p 226 LIVY creed in regard to the province of Bruttium was or dered to be followed in respect of Etruria and Liguria Marcus Cornelius was ordered to deliver the army to the new consul and his command being continued to hold the proviuce of Gaul with those legions which Lucius Scribonius pretor had commanded the year before The consuls then cast lots for the provinces Bruttium fell to Caspio Etruria to Servilius Geminus The provinces of the pretors were next put to the lot Paetus iElius obtained the city jurisdiction Cneius Lentulus Sardinia Publius Villius Sicily Quin tilius Varus Ariminum with two legions which had been under Lucretius Spurius Lucretius remained on his station in order that he might rebuild the city of Genoa which had been demolished by Mago the Carthaginian Publius Scipio s command was conti nued not for a period limited by time but by the bu siness until an end should be put to the war in Africa and it was decreed that a supplication should he per formed to obtain from the gods that his having passed into Africa might prove happy to the people to the general himself and to the army 2 Three thousand men were raised for Sicily and because whatever strength it had possessed was car ried over to Carthage it was resolved that the coast of that island should be guarded by forty ships lest any fleet should come thither from Africa Villius carried with him to Sicily thirteen new ships the rest were old ones repaired there Marcus Pomponius pretor of the former year his command of this fleet being continued took on board the new soldiers An equal number of ships were decreed by the senate to Cneius Octavius pretor likewise of the former year with the same right of command in order to protect the coast of Sardinia Lentulus pretor was ordered to supply the fleet with two thousand soldiers The defence of the coast of Italy was intrusted to Marcus Marcius pretor of the former year with the same number of ships because it was uncertain to what place the Carthaginians might direct their attack HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXX 227 which would probably be against whatever part was destitute of forces for its defence for that fleet in pursuance of a decree of the senate the consuls en listed three thousand men and also two city legions for the exigences of the war Spain with the armies there and the command was decreed to the former generals Lucius Lentulus and Lucius Manlius Acidi hus The Romans employed in their service for that year in all twenty legions and a hundred and sixty ships of war The pretors were directed to repair to their provinces and orders were given to the consuls that before their departure from the city they should celebrate the great games which Titus Manlius Tor quatus in his dictatorship had vowed to be exhibited in the fifth year if the condition of the state remained unaltered Religious apprehensions were raised in men s minds by relations of prodigies brought from several places It was believed that crows had not only torn with their beaks some gold in the capitol but had even eaten it At Antium mice gnawed a golden crown A vast quantity of locusts filled all the country round Capua though it could not be dis covered from whence they came At Reate a foal was produced with five feet At Anagnia there appeared in the sky at first scattered fire and afterwards a pro digious blaze At Frusino a circle encompassed the sun with a narrow line then the orb of the sun in creasing in size extended its circumference beyond the circle At Arpinum in a level plain the earth sunk into a vast gulf When one of the consuls sa crificed the first victims the head of the liver was wanting These prodigies were expiated by the greater victims the college of pontiffs directing to what gods the sacrifices should be made 3 As soon as this business was finished the consuls and pretors set out for their respective provinces They directed their chief attention to Africa as if it were allotted to them either because they saw that the grand interests of their country and of the war depended on the proceedings there or from a desire 228 uvy to gratify Scipio who was then the ohject of universal favor among all the members of the state Therefore thither were sent not only from Sardinia as was men tioned before but from Sicily also and Spain cloth ing corn and arms with every other kind of stores while Scipio relaxed not his diligence during any part of the winter in the operations of war for which he found abundant occasion on every side He was en gaged in the siege of Utica Hasdrubal s camp was within sight the Carthaginians had launched their ships and kept their ffeet equipped and in readiness to intercept his convoys Amidst so many objects which required his attention he did not neglect en deavoring to recover the friendship of Syphax hoping that he might now perhaps be cloyed with love in the full enjoyment of his bride The answers of Syphax contained chiefly proposals for an accommodation with the Carthaginians on the terms of the Romans re tiring from Africa and the Carthaginians from Italy but afforded scarcely any hopes that he would relin quish his present engagements I am more inclined to believe that this business was transacted by messen gers as most authors affirm than that Syphax came in person to the Roman camp to a conference as Antius Valerius writes At first the Roman general hardly permitted those terms to be mentioned by his people but afterwards in order that they might have a plau sible pretext for going frequently into the enemy s camp he softened his refusals even seemingly in clining to a negotiation The winter huts of the Car thaginians were composed almost intirely of timber which they had hastily collected from the fields those of the Numidians were formed of reeds interwoven and most of them covered with mats and dispersed up and down without any regularity some of them even on the outside of the trench and rampart for they were left to choose their own ground These circum stances being related to Scipio gave him hopes that he might find au opportunity of burning the enemy s camp HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXX 229 4 In the retinue of the embassy to Syphax he sent instead of the common attendants centurions of the first rank of approved courage and prudence dressed as servants who while the ambassadors were engaged in conference might ramble through the camp and observe all the approaches and outlets the situation and form both of the whole and of the several parts of it where the Carthaginians lay where the Numidians  what distance there was between Hasdrubal s station and the king s and at the same time discover their method of fixing outposts and watches and whether they were more open to surprise by night or by day Many conferences being held care was taken to send different persons at different times in order that the greater number might be acquainted with every cir cumstance These frequent conversations had led Sy phax and through him the Carthaginians to entertain daily more confident expectations of a peace when the Roman ambassadors told him that they were ordered not to return to the general without a definitive an swer therefore if his own determination was fixed he should declare it or if Hasdrubal and the Cartha ginians were to be consulted he should do it without delay It was time that either the terms of peace should be adjusted or the war carried on with vigor While Syphax was consulting Hasdrubal and Has drubal the Carthaginians the spies bad time to take a view of every thing and Scipio also to make the pre parations necessary to his design From the mention of accommodation and their expectation of it the Carthaginians and Numidians took not the necessary precautions against any attempt which the enemy might make At length an answer was returned in which as the Romans appeared exceedingly anxious for peace the Carthaginians took the opportunity of adding some unreasonable conditions which afforded a plausible pretence to Scipio who now wished to break the truce Accordingly telling the king s messenger that he would take the opinion of his council on the affair he answered him next day that  he alone had labored 230 LIVY to put an end to the war none of the other parties in tact showing any disposition towards it that Syphax must entertain no hopes of entering into any treaty with the Romans unless he renounced the party of the Carthaginians Thus he dissolved the truce in plans Launching his ships for it was now the beginning of spring he put on board engines and machines as if an attack on Utica were intended by sea at the same time sending two thousand men to take possession of the hill which commanded that place and which he had formerly occupied with a view at once to divert the attention of the enemy from his real design and to prevent any sally being made from the city while he should be employed at a distance against Syphax and Hasdrubal He likewise feared an attack should bis camp be left with only a small force to defend it 5 Having taken these preparatory steps he sum moned a council ordering the spies to give an account of the discoveries which they had made at the same time requesting Masinissa who was as well acquainted with every circumstance of the enemy to deliver his opinion  and lastly he informed them of a plan which he intended to execute on the following night He gave orders to the tribunes that as soon as the trum pets had sounded on the breaking up of the meeting at the pretorium they should march the legions out of the camp In pursuance of these orders the troops began to move a little before sunset about the first watch they formed their line of march and about midnight for the way was seven miles proceeding in a moderate pace they arrived at the enemy s camp He there gave Laelius the command of a part of the forces to whom were joined Masinissa and the Numi dians with orders to fall on the camp of Syphax and set it on fire Then taking Laelius and Masinissa apart he intreated each separately that as the night would be apt to impede the best concerted measures they should make up for the difficulties by their dili gence and care telling them also that  he meant to attack Hasdrubat and the Carthaginian camp but would HISTORY OF ROME BOOK XXX 231 not begin his operations until he should see the fire in that of the king The business was not long delayed and as the huts all stood contiguously the flames spread rapidly through every part of the camp The alarm was great by reason of its being night and from the widely extended blaze but the king s troops thinking it an accidental calamity rushed out unarmed in order to extinguish the flames and met the enemy in arms particularly the Numidians whom Masiuissa being well acquainted with the king s station had posted at the openings of the passes Many perished in their beds while half asleep while many in their precipitate flight crowding on one another were trod den to death in the narrow passages of the gates 0 When the Carthaginian sentinels awakened by the tumult of the night beheld the fire they also sup posed it to be accidental while the shout raised amidst the slaughter and wounds was so confused the alarm too being in the dark that they were unable to dis cover the cause or extent of the evil which assailed them Running out therefore in the utmost hurry by all the gates without arms as not suspecting an enemy to be near and carrying nothing with them but what might serve to extinguish the flames they rushed against the body of Romans All of these were slain not merely to gratify hostile animosity but in order to prevent any one escaping with intelligence as to the truth of the affair Scipio immediately after attacked the gates which were neglected as may be supposed during such confusion and set fire to the nearest huts which soon communicating to the others the whole was enveloped in one general conflagration Half burned men and cattle stopped up the passages first by the hurry of their flight and afterwards with their carcases Those who had escaped the flames were cut off by the sword and the two camps were by one fatal blow involved in utter ruin However the two com manders with two thousand foot and five hundred horse half armed and a great part wounded or scorched got away There were destroyed by fire or sword forty 232 livy thousand men taken above five thousand many Car thaginian nobles eleven senators military standards a hundred and seventy four Numidian horses above two thousand seven hundred six elephants were taken and eight destroyed A great quantity of arms was taken all which the general dedicated to Vulcan and committed to the flames 7 Hasdrubal with a small number of Africans had directed his flight to the nearest city and thither all who survived following the steps of their general had assembled but dreading lest he should be delivered into the hands of Scipio he soon after quitted it The Romans who were immediately after received there committed no act of hostility because the surrender was voluntary Two other cities were taken and plundered and the booty found in them together with what had been saved when the camps were burned was given up to the soldiers Syphax halted in a fortified post at about eight miles distance Has drubal lest any timorous measures should be adopted through the violent apprehensions occasioned by the late disaster proceeded to Carthage where such con sternation had seized the people that they made no doubt but Scipio would leave Utica and instantly lay siege to Carthage The senate was therefore assem bled by the suffetes who are invested with the same authority as our consuls Three different opinions were offered on the occasion one proposed sending ambassadors to Scipio with proposals of peace ano ther the recalling of Hannibal to defend his country the third showed Roman firmness in adversity recom mending to recruit the army and to intreat Syphax not to abandon the war This latter opinion prevailed because Hasdrubal who was present and all of the Barcine faction were disposed to fight to the last On this they began to levy troops in the city and the coun try and sent ambassadors to Syphax who was himself most vigorously employed in making preparations for the renewal of hostilities His queen had prevailed not on this occasion as formerly by her allurements HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXX 233 which were sufficiently powerful over the mind of her lover but by prayers and appeals to his compassion with tears having beseeched him not lo forsake her father and her country nor suffer Carthage to be burned as the camps had been Add to this some new ground of hope which offered itself very season ably the ambassadors acquainting him that they had met near the city called Abba four thousand Celtibe rians able young men who had been enlisted by their recruiting parties in Spain and that Hasdrubal would speedily arrive with a body of troops far from con temptible Syphax not only gave a favorable answer to the Carthaginians but showed them a multitude of Numidian peasants to whom he had within a few days given arms and horses and assured them also that he would call out all the youth in his kingdom observing that their loss had been occasioned by fire not by battle and that he only who was defeated by arms ought to be deemed inferior to his enemy Such was his reply and a few days after he and Hasdrubal again joined their forces when their whole army amounted to about thirty thousand fighting men 8 While Scipio gave his whole attention to the siege of Utica as if no farther hostilities were to be apprehended from Syphax and the Carthaginians and was employed in bringing up his machines to the walls he was called away by the news of the war being re vived Leaving therefore only a small number of men on sea and land to keep up the appearance of a siege he set out himself with the main body of the army to meet the enemy At first he took post on a hill distant about four miles from the king s camp On the day following descending into the great plains as they are called which lie under that hill with a body of cavalry he spent the day in advancing fre quently to the enemy s posts and provoking them by slight skirmishes For the two succeeding days how ever though irregular excursions were made by both parties in turn nothing worth notice was performed On the fourth day both armies came out to battle The 234 LIVY Romans placed their first rank men behind the front battalions consisting of the spearmen and the veterans in reserve posting the Italian cavalry on the right wing the Numidians and Masinissa on the left Sy phax and Hasdrubal having placed their Numidians opposite to the Italian cavalry and the Carthaginians opposite to Masinissa drew the Celtiberians into the centre of the line facing the battalions of the legions in this order they began the engagement On the first encounter both wings Numidians and Carthaginians were forced to give way for neither could the Numi dians most of whom were undisciplined peasants with stand the Roman cavalry nor the Carthaginians who were also raw soldiers withstand Masinissa who be sides other circumstances was rendered terrible by his late victory The line of Celtiberians although hav ing lost the cover of the wings they were exposed on both flanks yet resolutely kept their ground  for nei ther could they see any safety in flight being unac quainted with the country nor had they any hope of pardon from Scipio having come into Africa to fight against him for the sake of hire notwithstanding the favors which he had conferred on them and their na tion Surrounded therefore on all sides they died with determined obstinacy falling in heaps one over another and while the attention of all was turned on them Syphax and Hasdrubal availed themselves of this opportunity and gained a considerable space of time to effect their escape Night came on the con querors who were fatigued more with killing than from the length of the contest 9 Next day Scipio sent Latins and Masinissa with all the Roman and Numidian cavalry and the light infantry in pursuit of Syphax and Hasdrubal He himself with the main body of the army reduced all the cities in that part of the country which belonged to the Carthaginians some by offering them hopes others by threats others by force At Carthage the conster nation was excessive they expected nothing less than that Scipio who was extending his operations on every HISTORY OF ROME BOOK XXX 235 side should quickly subdue all the neighboring places and then immediately invest their city They there fore repaired the walls and strengthened them with outworks every one exerting himself in bringing in from the country such things as were requisite for sustaining a long and powerful siege Little mention was made of peace very many advised that a deputa tion should be sent to recall Hannibal but the greater number were earnest for despatching the fleet which liad been equipped for the purpose of intercepting the convoys to surprise the ships stationed at Utica where no attack was expected alleging the probabi lity that they might at the same time make them selves masters of the naval camp which had been left with a slight guard This latter scheme met general approbation but at the same time they determined to call Hannibal home because should the fleet meet with all possible success Utica would indeed be re lieved from some part of the pressure of the siege but for the defence of Carthage itself there was now no general remaining but Hannibal and no army but his The ships were therefore launched on the follow ing day at the same time the deputies set out for Italy and the juncture being critical every measure was executed with the utmost despatch each man thinking that if he were in any degree remiss he was so far a betrayer of the public safety Scipio led on his forces by slow marches as they were heavily loaded with the spoils of many cities After sending the prisoners and other booty to his old camp at Utica directing his views to Carthage he seized on Tunes which was defenceless the garrison having fled This city was very strong both by nature and art it may be seen from Carthage from which it is distant about fifteeu miles and at the same time affords a prospect of that city and the adjacent sea 10 The Romans while busily employed in raising a rampart at Tunes descried the fleet which was steer ing to Utica On this the work was instantly dropped and orders to march were issued The troops set out 236 LIVY with the utmost speed lest the Roman fleet should be surprised while attentive only to the siege and in no condition for a naval fight for how could any re sistance have been made to a fleet of active ships fur nished with every kind of arms by vessels loaded with engines and machines and which were either con verted to the purpose of transports or pushed so close to the walls that they served instead of mounds and bridges for the men to mount by 1 Scipio therefore contrary to the usual practice in sea engagements drawing back the ships of war which might be a pro tection to the others into the rear near the land op posed to the enemy a line of transports consisting of four in depth to serve as a wall and lest this line should be broken during the confusion of the fight he fastened the vessels together by means of masts and yards passed from one to another with strong ropes in such a manner as to form as it might be called one intire tier Over these he laid planks which formed a passage from ship to ship through the whole line and under those bridges of communication he left openings through which the scout boats might run out towards the enemy and retreat with safety Hav ing completed these sea works as well as the time al lowed he put on board the transports about a thousand chosen men to defend them with a vast quantity of weapons chiefly missive sufficient to serve for a battle of any continuance Thus prepared they waited atten tively the coming of the enemy Had the Carthagi nians been expeditious they might at the first onset have overpowered the Romans every thing being in hurry and confusion but dispirited by their losses on land and losing thereby their confidence at sea also where their strength however was superior they spent the whole day in approaching slowly and about sunset put into a harbor which the Africans call Rnscino On the following day about sunrise they formed their ships in a line towards the open sea as if for a regular sea fight and as if the Romans were to come out to meet them When they had stood thus for a long HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXX 237 time and saw that no motion was made by the enemy they attacked the transports The affair bore no re semblance to a naval engagement it was more like an attack made by ships against walls The transports bad some advantage in their height for the Cartha ginians being obliged to throw their weapons upward discharged most of them to no purpose against the higher places whereas those from the transports fell with greater force at the same time gaining additional power from their own weight The scouts and lighter Roman vessels which pushed out through the open ings under the bridges of communication between their ships were at first run down by the weight and bulk of the Carthaginian ships of war and afterwards they became an obstruction to those who defended the line because as they were mixed among the enemy s ships they often obliged them to stop the discharge of their weapons lest missing their aim they should hit their friends At length the Carthaginians threw among the Romans beams furnished at the ends with iron hooks which the soldiers call harpoons They could neither cut the beams nor the chains by which they were raised in order to be thrown so that as soon as any of the ships of war hauling back dragged a transport entangled by the hook the fastenings of these vessels broke and in some places several were dragged away together By this means chiefly were all the bridges torn asunder and scarcely had the defenders time to make their escape into the second row of ships About six were towed away to Carthage where the joy of the people was greater than the occasion merited But they were the more sensibly affected because this gleam of good fortune however small had unexpectedly shone on them in the midst of a continued course of losses and lamentations It appeared that the Roman fleet would hardly have escaped destruction had not their own commanders been dilatory so that Scipio had time to bring in relief 11 Laelius and Masinissa having about the fifteenth day arrived in Numidia Massylia Masinissa s here LIVY ditary kingdom submitted to him with joy as to a prince whom they had long and earnestly wished to hail Syphax seeing all his commanders and garri sons expelled from thence retired within his own ori ginal dominions but in no disposition to remain quiet In his ambitious views he was spurred on by his queen and father in law and indeed he possessed such abun dance of men and horses that a mind less barbarous and violent than his might well assume confidence and when reflecting on the great strength of a king dom which had enjoyed prosperity for a long course of years Wherefore collecting together all who were able to bear arms he distributed among them horses and weapons he divided the horsemen into troops and the footmen into cohorts as he had formerly learned from the Roman centurions and thus with an army not less numerous than that which he had before but composed almost intirely of raw undisci plined men he advanced towards the enemy and pitched his camp at a small distance from theirs At first a few horsemen advanced from the outposts to make observations these being attacked with jave lins retreated to their friends Skirmishing parties then came forth from both sides and whichever of these were repulsed their fellows being inflamed with indignation came up in greater numbers to their sup port This is generally the prelude to engagements between the cavalry hope encouraging the party which prevails and rage exasperating that which is worsted Thus on the present occasion the fight having com menced between small divisions the eagerness of the dispute drew out at length the whole force of cavalry on both sides While the contest lay intirely between these the Massesylians whom Syphax sent out in im mense bodies could hardly be withstood Afterwards the Roman infantry rushing in suddenly between their own cavalry who opened passages for them gave firmness to their line and terrified the enemy who were advancing furiously to the charge The barba rians at first pushed on their horses with less brisk HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXX 239 ness then halted disconcerted somewhat by this new manner of fighting at last they not only gave way to the infantry but did not dare to withstand even the horse emboldened as they were by the support of the foot And now the battalions also of the legions ap proached when the Masaesylians so far from daring to meet their first attack could not support even the sight of their engines and arms so strongly were they affected either by the recollection of their former ca lamities or by the present danger At this juncture Syphax galloping up to try if either by shame or by the danger to which he was exposed he could stop the flight of his men being thrown from his horse which was grievously wounded was overpowered and taken and dragged alive to Laelius â a sight grateful to Ma sinissa above all others To Cirtha the capital of Syphax s kingdom a vast multitude fled The num ber of slain in that battle was less than in proportion to the greatness of the victory because the cavalry only had been engaged Not more than five thousand were killed less than half that number taken in an attack on their camp to which the multitude had re tired in dismay at the loss of their king r 12 Masinissa declared that  nothing could be more highly gratifying to him now that he was victorious after so long a struggle than to revisit his paternal kingdom but that the present happy situation of bis affairs required activity as much as his former mis fortunes If Laelius would permit him to go on before him to Cirtha with the cavalry and Syphax as his prisoner he would strike such terror while the enemy were in confusion and dismay as would crush all oppo sition and that Laslius might follow with the infantry by easy marches Laslius assenting he went forward to Cirtha and ordered the principal inhabitants to be invited to a conference But as they were ignorant of their king s misfortune neither his relation of what had passed nor his threats nor persuasions wrought any effect until Syphax was produced to their view in chains This shocking sight excited a general lamen 240 LIVY tation some in a panic deserted the walls others hastily agreed to endeavor to gain the favor of the conqueror and opened the gates whereon Masinissa having despatched guards to these and other parts of the fortifications to prevent any person going out of the town gallopped on in full speed to take possession of the palace As he entered the porch Sophonisba Syphax s queen daughter of Hasdrubal the Cartha ginian met him at the door where seeing Masinissa in the midst of a band of armed men distinguished by his arms and apparel and judging rightly that he was the king she fell at his knees and thus addressed him The favor of the gods added to your own valor and good fortune has given you absolute power to dis pose of us But if in the presence of the sovereign disposer of her life and death a captive may be allowed to utter the words of a suppliant to touch his knees or victorious right hand I intreat and beseech you by the majesty of a king of which we also were just now possessed by the name of the Numidian race which is common to you and Syphax by the guardian gods of this palace who I hope will receive you with better omens than they sent Syphax hence grant so much favor to your suppliant as that you will yourself de termine whatever you may think proper concerning your captive and not suffer me to fall under the haughty and cruel disposal of any Roman Were I nothing more than the wife of Syphax I had much rather trust to the honor of a Numidian one born in the same country with me than to a foreigner and from a distant part of the world but what a Carthaginian what the daughter of Hasdrubal has reason to dread from a Roman is manifest to you If you cannot by any other means I implore and beseech you that you will by my death secure me from the power of the Romans She was remarkably beautiful and in the full bloom of youth so that while she pressed his right hand and implored his protection only so far as that she should not be delivered up to any Roman her discourse was more like caresses than ifitreaty and HISTORY OF ROME BOOK XXX 241 the conqueror s mind was not only subdued to pity but as all the Numidians are extremely amorous the vic torious king became the slave of his captive 1 and giving his right band as a pledge for the performance of what she had requested he went into the palace Immediately he began to consider within himself by what means he might fulfil his engagement and not being able to devise any he adopted a rash and shame ful resolution suggested by his love He gave orders that every thing should be instantly prepared for a marriage on that same day in order that he might leave no room for Laelius or Scipio himself to pro ceed against her as a captive since she would then be his wife After the marriage was concluded Laelius arrived and so far was he from dissembling his dis approbation of the proceeding that at first he even re solved to drag her from the nuptial bed and send her with Syphax to Scipio but he was afterwards pre vailed on by the intreaties of Masinissa who besought him to leave it to the Romans to determine which of the two kings should have Sophonisba a sharer of his fortune Sending away therefore Syphax and the other prisoners he reduced with the assistance of Masinissa all the cities of Numidia which were held by the king s garrisons 13 When it was announced that the detachment was bringing Syphax to the camp the whole multitude poured out as if to the sight of a triumph He pre ceded the rest in chains and was followed by a number of noble Numidians On this occasion every one spoke in the most exalted terms of the greatness of Syphax and the fame of his nation thus exaggerating the re nown of their victory That was the king they said to whose dignity the two most powerful states in the l Sophonisba had been formerly betrothed to Masinissa and being afterwards given to Syphax was one reason of his quarrelling with the Carthaginians and joining the Romans Another was that in the contest between him and Mezutu lus for the throne his rival had been aided by the Cartha ginians LIV VOL V Â 242 LIVY world the Roman and Carthaginian had paid such deference that for the sake of procuring his friend ship their own general Scipio leaving his province and his army sailed with only two quinqueremes to Africa and the Carthaginian general Hasdrubal not only visited his kingdom but also gave him his daughter in marriage That the Roman and Carthaginian gene rals had been within his grasp at one and the same time That as both parties had by the offer of sacri fices solicited the favor of the immortal gods so his friendship had been equally sought for by both That he lately possessed power so great as to enable him to expel Masinissa from his kingdom and to reduce him to such a state that his life was preserved by a report of his death and by lurking in concealment while he was obliged like a wild beast to live in the woods on prey Such were the discourses of the throng through which the king was led to the general s quarters Sci pio was moved on comparing the former situation of the man with the present and also by the recollection of their connexion in hospitality of their right hands pledged and the treaty concluded between themselves and their states These circumstances gave Syphax courage in addressing his conqueror for when Scipio asked him what had been his views in not only re nouncing his alliance with the Romans but even making war on them V he answered that he had indeed erred or rather acted under an impulse of insanity but not at that time principally when he took up arms against the Romans that was the consequence of his madness not the actual beginning of it That he was indeed mad when he banished from his thoughts all the ties of private friendship and public leagues and when he received a Carthaginian wife into his house By those nuptial torches his palace had been set in flames that mischievous fury had by every kind of allurement perverted his judgment and led it astray nor ever desisted until with her own hands she clad him in de testable arms against his guest and bis friend Yet ruined and hopeless as he was he felt some comfort in HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXX 243 his misfortunes from seeing that pestilent woman re moved into the house and family of his bitterest enemy Adding that Masinissa possessed neither more pru dence nor firmness than himself His youth indeed had made him incautious but there was evidently more folly and rashness in the latter marriage than in his 14 These words dictated not merely by animosity towards his enemy but by anguish on seeing the woman whom he had loved in the possession of his rival im pressed the mind of Scipio with no small degree of solicitude He was however the more induced to listen to Syphax from the marriage having been hurried for ward in the midst of arms without either consulting or waiting for Laelius and from Masinissa s haste for on the very day in which he had seen Sophonisba made pri soner he had contracted matrimony with her and per formed the nuptial sacrifice in presence of the house hold gods of his enemy These proceedings appeared to Scipio the more heinous because he himself when in Spain and when a very young man had not allowed himself to be moved by the beauty of any captive what ever â While he was revolving these circumstances in his mind Laelius and Masinissa arrived to both of whom he gave the same kind reception  and afterwards made known their conduct with the highest praises in a full assembly Then retiring with Masinissa to a pri vate place he thus addressed him I suppose Masi nissa that in first coming to Spain for the purpose of contracting a friendship with me and afterwards in Africa submitting yourself and all your concerns to my protection you must have been influenced by some good qualities which I was said to possess Now of those virtues which made you think my favor worth soliciting there is not one on which I value myself so much as temperance and the government of my pas sions I wish Masinissa that to your other excellent qualifications you had added this one also There is not so much danger believe me there is not to persons of our time of life from armed foes as from the plea sures which every where surround us He who has 244 LIVY curbed and reduced his passions to subjection has really acquired to himself much greater glory and a far more honorable victory than that which we now enjoy in our conquest of Syphax The instances of courage and conduct which you displayed while I was not present I have mentioned with pleasure and I re tain a proper sense of them As to other matters I rather wish that you would review them in your own mind than that you should blush at my recital of them Syphax has been subdued and taken under the auspices of the Roman people therefore he his wife his king dom his territories his towns and the inhabitants of them in short whatever was the property of Syphax is now the prize of that people Both the king and his wife even though she were not a citizen of Carthage and we had not seen her father heading the enemy s army ought to have been sent to Rome where the Roman state should have had the power of judging aud determining concerning her â a woman who is said to have seduced a king in alliance with us and to have precipitated him into the war Restrain your feelings Beware lest by one vice you disparage a number of good qualities and destroy the credit of so many meritorious deeds by a fault too great to be palliated even by the occasion of it 15 On hearing this discourse not only Masinissa s countenance was suffused with blushes but he even burst into tears and after declaring that in future he would be directed intirely by Scipio and intreat ing him  as far as the affair would permit to consider the obligation into which he had rashly entered not to give the queen into the power of any one he retired in confusion from the general s tent to his own There dismissing his attendants he spent some time in sighs and moans which could be heard distinctly by those who stood without At last having uttered a deep groan he called one of his servants in whom he con fided and who had the charge of the poison which according to the custom of kings is kept against the uncertainties of fortune and ordered him to mix some HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXX 245 in a cup to carry it to Sophonisba and to tell her at the same time that  Masinissa would gladly have ful filled the first obligation which he owed her â that due from a husband to his wife but that since those who had the power had not left that in his option he now performed his second engagement that she should not come alive into the hands of the Romans He there fore requested her to remember her father the general her country and the two kings to whom she had been married and to take such steps as she should judge proper When the servant carrying this message and the poison came to Sophonisba â I receive said she this nuptial present by no means an unacceptable one if my husband has not the power to perform more for his wife Tell him however that I should have died better had I not married in the very moment of my funeral The firmness with which she spoke was not greater than the resolution with which she received and drank off the contents of the cup When Scipio was informed of this event dreading lest the young man whose passions were violent might in the pre sent disorder of his mind take some desperate measure he sent for him instantly and at one time consoled at another gently chid him for having atoned one act of rashness by another and for having rendered the affair more horrid than was necessary Next day in order to divert his thoughts from the object which at the present distressed him he mounted his tribunal and ordered an assembly to be summoned There after he had first honored Masinissa with the title of king and passed high encomiums on his merit he pre sented to him a golden crown a golden goblet a curule chair an ivory sceptre an embroidered robe and a vest striped with purple enhancing the honor by say ing that among the Romans there was nothing more magnificent than a triumph and that those who were so distinguished had not a more splendid dress than that of which Masinissa alone of all foreigners was esteemed worthy by the Roman people Laelius also he highly commended and presented with a golden 246 livy crown  and on others of the military he conferred gifts suitable to the services which they had performed By these honors conferred on him the king s mind was soothed and encouraged to hope that he should soon be in possession of the whole extent of Numidia now that Syphax was removed out of his way â 16 Scipio sending Caius Laelius with Syphax and the other prisoners to Rome with whom went also ambassadors from Masinissa led back his troops to Tunes and completed the fortifications which he had begun some time before The Carthaginians who had been filled with a short lived joy on account of their success in the attack on the Roman fleet and which in their then circumstances they had considered as im portant on hearing of the capture of Syphax in whom they had placed more of their hopes than in Hasdrubal and their own army were struck with dismay and would listen no longer to any who advised to continue the war but sent as their agents to sue for peace thirty of the principal elders These compose the as sembly of the highest dignity among them having the principal control over the senate itself Arriving at the general s tent they prostrated themselves like those who humbly fawn on kings having learned that mode I suppose from the country whence they de rived their origin Their discourse was suitable to such servile adulation not attempting to apologise for their conduct but transferring the blame on Hannibal and the favorers of his violent measures They im plored pardon for their state which bad been twice ruined by the rashness of its citizens and would a second time be indebted for its restoration to the generosity of an enemy they observed that  the Ro man people sought dominion over the conquered not their destruction and declared themselves ready to pay implicit obedience to any commands which their subjugators should be pleased to impose Scipio told them that  he had come into Africa with the expecta i tion which had been farther encouraged by the happy fortune of his army of carrying home conquest no HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXX 247 peace That however although he had conquest within his reach yet he did not reject peace that all nations might know that the Roman people were guided by the principles of justice both in undertaking and concluding wars That these were the terms of peace which he prescribed â that they should give up the prisoners deserters and fugitives withdraw their armies from Italy and Gaul renounce all pretensions to Spain retire from all the islands which lie between Italy and Africa deliver up all their ships of war except twenty and furnish five hundred thousand measures of wheat and three hundred thousand of barley What sum of money he demanded authors are not agreed In some I find five thousand talents i in others five thousand pounds weight of silver while it is also said that double pay of the troops was imposed Three days said he  shall be allowed you to consider whether you approve of peace on these conditions If you do ap prove of it then make a truce with me and send am bassadors to Rome to the senate The Carthaginians thus dismissed thought it advisable to submit to any terms as the only object they had in view was to gain time until Hannibal should come over to Africa and therefore they sent ambassadors to Scipio to conclude a truce and others to Rome to solicit peace These carried with them a few prisoners deserters and fugi tives to make a show of obedience and that they might attain their object with the less difficulty 17 Laalius with Syphax and the principal Numidian prisoners arrived at Rome several days before them and related in order to the senate the several trans actions which had passed in Africa Great was the rejoicing on account of the present state of affairs and the most sanguine hopes were entertained with re spect to the future The senate then on the business being proposed ordered that the king should be sent prisoner to Alba and that Laelius should be detained until the arrival of the Carthaginian ambassadors A 1 968 750 248 LIVY supplication for four days was decreed Publius jEliiis pretor when the senate broke up called an assembly of the people and ascended the rostrum with Caius Laslius There on hearing thatthe Carthaginian armies bad been routed so renowned a monarch as Syphax vanquished and made prisoner and conquest ex tended with extraordinary success over every part of Numidia the people could not contain their joy but by shouts and other methods usually practised by the multitude expressed immoderate transports The pretor therefore immediately issued orders that the keepers should open the temples in every part of the city and that all should be allowed during the whole day to go round them and pay their worship and thanks to the gods On the day following he intro duced Masinissa s ambassadors who first congratu lated the senate on the success of Publius Scipio in Africa then gave thanks for his having  not only ho nored Masinissa with the title of king but made him one by reinstating him on the throne of his father where now that Syphax was removed he bad if it so pleased the senate a prospect of reigning without con test or apprehension they likewise made their ac knowlegements for praises he had bestowed on him in the assembly and for the very magnificent presents with which he had loaded him They added  that Masinissa had exerted his best endeavors to appear not unworthy of those favors and would continue so to do They then requested the senate to confirm by their decree the title of king and the other distin guished marks conferred on him by Scipio telling them that their monarch farther intreated that if it so pleased them the Numidian prisoners then at Rome might be sent home â a circumstance which would do him high honor among his countrymen The senate made answer  that congratulations on the successes of Africa ought in the confederates to be mutual that Scipio appeared to have acted properly and regularly in giving to their Numidian ally the title of king and that whatever else he should do grateful to Masinissa HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXX 249 the senate ratified and approved it They then or dered the pretor to prepare the following presents for the king â two purple rohes with a golden clasp and vests with broad purple borders two horses with trappings two suits of horseman s armor with coats of mail with tents and camp furniture such as is customary to provide for a consul Donatives were also voted for the ambassadors not less than five thou sand asses i to each for their attendants a thousand asses 2 two suits of apparel to each of the ambassa dors one to each of their attendants and the same to the Numidians who were to be freed from imprison ment and sent back to the king Besides which they ordered intire suites of apartments and entertainment for the embassy 18 In the course of the summer during which those transactions passed in Africa and these decrees at Rome Publius Quintilius Varus pretor and Marcus Cornelius proconsul fought a pitched battle with Ma go the Carthaginian in the country of the Insubrian Gauls The pretor s legions were in the first line Cornelius kept his in reserve placing himself in the front The pretor and proconsul exhorted the soldiers to make the attack with the utmost vigor Finding that they made no impression on the Carthaginian line Quintilius said to Cornelius  The battle flags as you may perceive and the enemy finding themselves able to make resistance beyond what they had hoped are hardened against fear and it is well if they do not assume boldness we must bear down with the ca valry if we expect to disorder or drive them from their ground Do you therefore support the battle in front and I will bring up the horse or I will take care of matters here while you charge with the ca valry of the four legions The proconsul offering to undertake either part of the business as the pretor should direct Quintilius the pretor with his son Mar cus a youth of a high and ardent spirit took the com i 16 2s lid 2 SI 4s 7d 250  Liyy mand of the cavalry and having ordered them to mount their horses led them on instantly to the charge The confusion occasioned by these was in creased by the shouts of the legions nor would the Carthaginian line have stood their ground bad not Mago immediately brought up the elephants to the fight having kept them in readiness against the first motion which the horse should make By the snorting and sight of these animals the horses were frightened to such a degree as rendered the aid of the cavalry of no effect As the Roman horseman had the advantage in point of strength when in close fight and when he could use his javelin and sword hand to hand so the Numidian had the better in darting jave lins at him from a distance and when his horse s fright would not suffer him to advance Among the infan try the twelfth legion having lost the greater part of their number kept their ground rather through shame than that they had strength to maintain it They must soon however have fallen back had not the thir teenth legion led up from the reserve to the front supported the doubtful conflict Mago at the same time brought up to oppose this fresh legion the Gauls drawn also from his reserve These being routed without much difficulty the spearmen of the eleventh legion formed themselves into a circular body and at tacked the elephants which were now throwing the line of the infantry into confusion and by discharging their spears at them hardly any of which were thrown in vain as the beasts were close together they turned them all on the line of their own party Four of them overpowered with wounds fell On this the first line of the enemy began to give way when all the infantry seeing the elephants turning about rushed on in order to increase the terror and confusion As long how ever as Mago stood at the head of the troops the ranks retreating leisurely kept up the spirit of the battle but when they saw him fall on receiving a wound through his thigh and carried lifeless out of the field instantly all betook themselves to flight HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXX 251 There were five thousand Carthaginians slain on that day and twenty two military ensigns taken Nor was the victory bloodless on the side of the Romans two thousand three hundred men of the pretor s army were lost by far the greater part of whom were of the twelfth legion of which legion also fell two military tribunes Marcus Gosconius and Marcus Maenius Of the thirteenth legion likewise which had shared the latter part of the engagement Cneius Helvius mili tary tribune was slain while employed in restoring the fight There perished besides thirty two horsemen of some distinction who were trodden down by the elephants together with some centurions Probably the contest would not have been so soon ended had not the wound of their general made the enemy retire from the field 19 Mago setting out during the silence of the next night and making as long journeys as his wound al lowed him to bear arrived at the sea coast in the country of the Ingaunian Ligurians There the depu ties from Carthage who had a few days before arrived with the ships in the Gallic bay waited on him and delivered orders to him to pass over to Africa as soon as possible informing him that his brother Hannibal to whom messengers had been also sent would do the same for the affairs of the Carthaginians were not in a condition to hold possession of Gaul and Italy by arms Mago was not only moved by the commands of the senate and the danger that threatened his coun try but dreaded lest if he delayed he might be hard pressed by the victorious enemy and also lest the Ligurians themselves seeing that the Carthaginians were about to relinquish Italy might revolt to those under whose power they must speedily fall He at the same time entertained hopes that his wound might be less irritated on board a ship than on land and that he might there be able to attend to the cure of it with more convenience Embarking therefore his troops he set sail and had scarcely passed Sardinia when he died on the coast of which island several Carthagi 252 livY nian ships which had been dispersed were taken by the Roman fleet Such were the occurrences by land and sea on that side of Italy nearest to the Alps The consul Cneius Servilius performed nothing memo rable in Etruria or in Gaul for he bad advanced into that country except that he rescued from slavery which they had endured for sixteen years his father Cains Servilius and his uncle Caius Lutatius who had been taken by the Boians at the village of Tane tum He returned to Rome accompanied by these on each side of him distinguished rather by family badges than public services It was proposed to the people that  Cneius Servilius should not be subject to penalty for having contrary to the laws during the life of his father a circumstance of which he was at that time ignorant and who sat in the curule chair accepted the offices of tribune of the commons and plebeian edile this being admitted he returned to his province Consentia Uffugum Vergae Besidiae Hetriculum Sypheum Argentanum Clampetia and many other small states perceiving that the Cartha ginians grew languid in their operations came over to Cneius Servilius the consul then in Bruttium and who had fought a battle with Hannibal in the district of Croton of which we have no clear account Va lerius Autias says that five thousand of the enemy were slain This is a circumstance of such impor tance that either it must be an impudent fiction or they were guilty of great negligence who omitted mentioning it It is certain that Hannibal made no farther efforts in Italy for deputies came to him from Carthage recalling him to Africa nearly at the same time with Mago 20 Hannibal is said to have been thrown into the most violent agitation and scarcely to have refrained from shedding tears on hearing the words of the de puties When they had delivered the orders which they had in charge he said â Now indeed they recall me not in ambiguous terms but openly who have for a long time past been dragging me home HISTORY OF SOME BOOK XXX 253 by refusing me supplies both of men and money It is not the Roman people so often discomfited and routed that has conquered Hannibal but the Cartha ginian senate through the malicious suggestions of envy nor will Scipio exult and pride himself so much in this my disgraceful retreat as will Hanno who unable to do it by any other means has crushed our family under the ruins of Carthage As he had for some time foreseen this event he had ships already prepared dismissing therefore a useless crowd of soldiers under the appearance of garrisons into the towns of Bruttium a few of which adhered to him ra ther through fear than affection he carried over to Africa such of the troops as were fit for service A great number of natives of Italy refusing to follow him to Africa and flying to the sanctuary of Juno Lacinia which till that day had never been violated were barbarously put to death within the walls of the temple We are told that hardly any person ever showed more grief on leaving his native soil to go into exile than Hannibal on his departure from the coun try of his enemy that he often looked back on the coasts of Italy inveighing against gods and men ut tering curses on his own head for not having led his men to Rome yet reeking with blood from the slaugh ter at Cannx reflecting with the bitterest vexation that Scipio who since his appointment to the consul ship had not looked in the face of the Carthaginian enemy in Italy had yet spirit to go and attack Car thage while he who had slain a hundred thousand fighting men at Thrasymenus and Cannae had suffered bis strength to moulder away about Casilinum Cuma and Nola In the midst of such self reproaches and com plaints he was forced away from Italy in which he had so long maintained a divided power with the Romans 21 News was brought to Rome at the same time that both Mago and Hannibal had departed for Africa But the exultation of the people was diminished by the reflection that the Roman commanders had shown a want either of spirit or of strength in not prevent 251 LIVY ing such departure though they had received orders to that purpose from the senate They had also much anxiety concerning the final issue of affairs now that the whole weight of the war fell on one general and his army About the same time ambassadors arrived from Saguntum bringing with them some Carthagi nians who had come over to Spain to hire auxiliaries and whom they had seized together with their money They laid down in the porch of the senate house two hundred and fifty pounds weight of gold and eighty of silver The agents were thrown into prison the gold and silver were returned and thanks given to the Sa guntines presents were made to them besides and ships provided to convey them home to Spain Some of the older senators then observed that  Men had less lively sensations of good than of evil Did they remember what terror and consternation Hannibal s coming into Italy had excited What losses they had sustained and what lamentations had followed When the Carthaginian camp was seen from the walls of the city what vows were then offered up by each particu lar person and by the whole body of the people How often in their assemblies were their hands stretched out towards heaven and exclamations heard â O will that day ever arrive when we shall see Italy cleared of the enemy and blessed once more with the enjoyment of peace That now at length in the sixteenth year the gods had granted their wish and yet not the slightest proposal had been made of returning thanks to the gods So deficient are men in gratitude even at the time when a favor is received and much less are they apt to retain a proper sense of it afterwards Immediately a general exclamation broke forth from every part of the senate house that Publius jElius the pretor should take the sense of the senate on the subject and a decree passed that a sup plication should be solemnised in all the temples for five days and a hundred and twenty of the greater victims offered in sacrifice â 22 After Laelius and Masinissa s ambassadors were HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXX 255 dismissed accounts were brought that the Carthagi nian ambassadors who were coming to treat of peace had been seen at Puteoli and would proceed from thence by land on which the senate resolved that Caius Laelius should be recalled in order that he might be present at the proceedings Quintus Fulvius Gillo a lieutenant general under Scipio conducted the Car thaginians to Rome but they were forbidden to enter the city Apartments were provided for them in the Villa Publica and an audience of the senate was granted them in the temple of Bellona Their dis course was nearly the same with that which they had made to Scipio throwing off all the blame of the war from the community and laying it on Hannibal They affirmed that  he had acted contrary to the orders of the senate not only in passing the Alps but even in crossing the Iberus and that he had without any au thority from them made war not only on the Romans but before that on the Saguntines that if the facts were duly considered the senate and people of Car thage had to that day inviolably observed the treaty with the Romans Therefore they had nothing farther in charge than to request that they might be allowed to abide by the terms of the peace which had been lately concluded with the consul Lutatius The pre tor according to the established custom giving per mission to the senators to make such inquiries of the ambassadors as any of them thought proper the older members who had been present at the concluding of the treaties asked various questions relative to them The Carthaginians replied that they were not of an age to remember particulars for almost all of them were young on which the house resounded with ex clamations that Punic faith was evident in appointing such men as these to solicit the renewal of a former peace with the terms of which they were themselves unacquainted 23 The ambassadors being ordered to withdraw the senators proceeded to give their opinions Mar cus Livius recommended that Cneius Servilius the 256 LIVY consul who was the nearest home should be sent for to be present at the proceedings for as no subject of greater importance than the present could ever come under their consideration so he did not think it con sistent with the dignity of the Roman people that an affair of such magnitude should be transacted in the absence of both the consuls Quintus Metellus who three years before had been consul and had also been dictator proposed that whereas Publius Scipio by destroying the armies of the enemy and wasting their country had reduced them to such necessity that they sued for peace No person whatever could be a more competent judge of their intention in making the ap plication and therefore they should be wholly directed by the advice of that general who was carrying on the war under the walls of Carthage Marcus Vale rius Laeviuus who had been twice consul charged those men with being come as spies and not as ambas sadors and advised that  they should be ordered to depart from Italy that guards should he sent with them to their ships and that orders should be sent to Scipio not to intermit his operations Laelius and Fulvius added that  Scipio had grounded his hopes of success on Hannibal and Mago not being recalled from Italy That the Carthaginians would feign a compli ance with any measures while they waited for the ar rival of those generals and their armies and would afterwards forgetting all gods and all treaties how ever recent pursue the war This observation made them more readily concur in the opinion of Laevinus The ambassadors were therefore dismissed and almost without an answer 24 About the same time the consul Cneius Servi lius not doubting bat that he should enjoy the glory of having restored peace to Italy passed over into Sicily in pursuit of Hannibal as if he himself had compelled him to retreat intending to proceed from thence to Africa As soon as this became known at Rome the senate at first voted that the pretor should write to the consul that they required him to return to HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXX Italy Afterwards on the pretov s assuring them that Servilius would pay no regard to his letter Publius Sulpicius being created dictator for the purpose re called the consul by virtue of his superior authority and then with Marcus Servilius master of the horse he spent the remainder of the year in going round to the cities which had forfeited their allegiance during the war and examining into the conduct of each During the continuance of the truce a hundred trans ports with stores under the convoy of twenty ships of war sent from Sardinia by Lentulus the pretor ar rived safe in Africa without meeting any obstruction either from the enemy or bad weather Cneius Octa vius who sailed from Sicily with two hundred trans ports and thirty ships of war had not the same good fortune His voyage was prosperous until he came almost within sight of Africa when the wind at first subsided into a calm then springing up heavily from the south west his ships were dispersed on all sides He himself with the ships of war struggling through the opposing waves with excessive toil to the rowers made the promontory of Apollo the transports were most of them driven to jEgimurus an island stretch ing across the mouth of the bay on which Carthage stands distant from the city about thirty miles the rest towards that part of it where the hot baths are found All this happened within view of Carthage and occasioned a concourse of people from all parts in the forum The magistrates assembled the senate the multitude in the porch of the senate house ex pressed aloud their uneasiness lest so great a booty should be allowed to escape out of their hands Al though some objected that their faith was pledged in having sued for peace others in their having agreed to a truce and which had not yet expired yet the assem bly being composed of nearly an equal number of the populace as of senators came to a resolution that Has drubal should go to jEgimurus with a fleet of fifty sail and proceed from thence to pick up the scattered ships of the Romans in the several harbors and along liv vol v R 258 livy the coasts First the transports from Egimurus aban doned by the mariners who effected their escape were towed to Carthage afterwards those from the baths 35 The ambassadors had not yet returned from Rome nor was it known what were the sentiments of the Roman senate concerning war or peace neither was the term of the truce expired Scipio on this account more highly resented the injury offered by those who had petitioned for peace and the truce and considering it as breaking off the negotiations and an infraction of the truce he instantly sent Mar cus Baebius Lucius Sergius and Lucius Fabius am bassadors to Carthage These having narrowly escaped suffering violence from the populace and still appre hending themselves exposed to danger applied to the magistrates who had protected them from ill treat ment for a guard of ships on their return Two tri remes were assigned them which as soon as they came to the river Bagrada from whence there was a view of the Roman camp returned to Carthage There was a Carthaginian fleet stationed at Utica from which two quadriremes were sent either in consequence of private orders from Carthage or Hasdrubal who com manded that fleet for the infraction was unauthorised by the public and which suddenly attacked the Ro man quinquereme as it came round the promontory The Carthaginian vessels attempted to strike the Ro man with their prows but which they could not effect by reason of its activity nor could the fighting men leap from those lower ships into the higher ones The quinquereme was gallantly defended as long as wea pons lasted These however spent there was nothing that could save them but the land being near and the multitude which poured out from the camp to the coast They therefore pressed forward using their utmost efforts with their oars and running on shore the men escaped but the ship was intirely lost After the truce had been thus broken by outrage after out rage Laelius and Fulvius arrived from Rome with the Carthaginian ambassadors To these Scipio declared HISTORY OF ROME â 259 BOOK XXX that  although the Carthaginians had violated not only their faith pledged in the truce but also the laws of nations respecting ambassadors yet they should meet no treatment from him unbecoming the maxims of the Roman people and his own principles and thus dis missing them he prepared for war Hannibal now drew nigh the land when one of the sailors was ordered to climb the mast and discover what part of the coun try they were arrived at and on his saying that their course pointed to a ruined sepulchre the Carthaginian struck with the ill omen ordered the pilot to steer past that place put in his fleet at Leptis and there disembarked his forces 2C These were the transactions in Africa during that year those which follow belong to the period in which Marcus Servilius Geminus who was then mas ter of the horse and Tiberius Claudius Nero were consuls However towards the end of the former year deputies arrived from the allied cities of Greece They complained that their lands were ravaged by Philip s garrisons and that their ambassadors who had gone into Macedonia to solicit reparation of their injuries had not been admitted to the presence of the king At the same time they gave information that four thousand soldiers under the command of Sopater had gone over to Africa and were marching to the assistance of the Carthaginians and that some money also had been sent with them whereon the senate or dered that an embassy should be sent to the king to acquaint him that the senate considered those proceed ings as contrary to the treaty subsisting between them Caius Terentius Varro Caius Mamilius and Marcus Aurelius were despatched on this business with an escort of three quinqueremes That year was remark able for a great fire by which the buildings on the Publician hill were bnrned to the ground and also for an uncommon overflowing of the rivers but provi sions were plentiful because in consequence of peace all parts of Italy were open for importation and be sides a great quantity of corn which bad been sent 260 LIVY from Spain was delivered out to the inhabitants at the easy rate of four asses a bushel by the curule ediles Marcus Valerius Falto and Marcus Fabius Buteo In the same year died Quintus Fabius Maximus in ex treme old age if it be true as some writers affirm that he had been augur for sixty two years He was cer tainly a man worthy of the great surname which he bore even if he were the first to whom it was applied He surpassed his father and was equal to his grand father in the honorable posts which he filled His grandfather Rullus was distinguished by a greater number of victories and greater battles but the ac tions of Fabius having such an antagonist as Hannibal may be considered as equivalent to them all He was deemed to possess more caution than spirit but though it may be doubted whether the dilatoriness of his con duct arose from his natural disposition or from a con viction that it was best suited to the war in which he was engaged yet nothing is more certain than that this man alone as the poet Ennius says by his delays re trieved our affairs Quintus Fabius Maximus his son was consecrated augur in bis place and Servius Sulpi cius Galba pontiff in his place also for he held two offices in the college of priests The Roman games were repeated for one day the plebeian thrice re peated intire by the curule ediles Marcus Sextius Sabinus and Caius Treniellius Flaccus Both these were elected pretors and with them Cains Livius Salinator and Caius Aurelius Cotta The different ac counts given by writers render it uncertain whether Caius Servilius consul presided at the elections that year or Publius Sulpicius nominated dictator by him because he himself was detained in Etruria being em ployed pursuant to a decree of the senate in holding inquisitions relative to the conspiracies of the principal inhabitants 27 In the beginning of the following year A U C 550 B C 202 Marcus Servilius and Tiberius Clau dius summoning the senate to the capitol consulted them concerning the provinces Both were desirous HISTORY OF ROME BOOK XXX 261 of obtaining Africa they therefore wished that Italy and Africa should be disposed of by lot but this was opposed though by Quintus Metellns chiefly The consuls were ordered to apply to the tribunes to take the sense of the people as to who should conduct the war in Africa All the tribes concurred in appointing Publius Scipio Nevertheless the consuls put the pro vince of Africa to the lot for so the senate had de creed and it fell to Tiberius Claudius who was to carry to Africa a fleet of fifty ships all quinqueremes with authority equal to that of Scipio Marcus Servi lius obtained Etruria and in the same province the command was continued to Caius Servilius if the se nate thought proper that the consul should remain in the city Of the pretors Marcus Sextius obtained Gaul where Publius Quintilius Varus was fo deliver to him two legions with the province Cains Livins Bruttium with the two legions which Publius Sem pronius proconsul had commanded the year before Cneius Tremellius Sicily with directions to receive from Publius Villius Tappulus pretor of the former year the province and two legions Villius as pro pretor was appointed to protect the coast of Sicily with twenty ships of war and one thousand troops Marcus Pomponius to convey from thence to Rome with the remaining twenty ships one thousand five hundred soldiers The city jurisdiction fell to Caius Aurelius Cotta the rest were conlinued in their pro vinces and with the armies to which they were first appointed Not more than sixteen legions were em ployed that year in the service of the empire In order to conciliate the favor of the gods to all their undertaking s and proceedings it was ordered that the consuls should before they set out to the campaign celebrate those games and with the greater victims which Titus Manlius dictator in the consulate of Mar cus Claudius Marcellus and Titus Quintius had vowed provided the commonwealth should for the next five years continue in the same state The games were exhibited in the circus during four days and the 262 LIVY victims sacrificed to the gods to whom they had been vowed 28 Meanwhile both hope and anxiety daily in creased in equal proportion nor could people judge with certainty whether it was a proper subject of re joicing that Hannibal had at the end of sixteen years departed from Italy and thereby left the possession of it open to the Roman people or whether they had not rather cause of fear in his having carried his army safe into Africa They considered that although the place was changed the danger was still the same that Quintus Fabius lately deceased who foretold the vio lence of this struggle had grounds for what he farther presaged namely that Hannibal would prove a more formidable enemy in his own country than he had been in a foreign one Scipio he said  would not have to deal with Syphax a king of undisciplined barbarians whose army had been sometimes commanded by Stato rius a man but little elevated above the condition of a slave nor with such a dastardly general as his father in law Hasdrubal nor with tumultuary armies has tily collected out of a crowd of armed rustics â but with Hannibal a general of the greatest bravery brought up from his infancy in the midst of arms in his childhood a soldier when scarcely arrived at the age of youth a general who had advanced to an old age through a course of victories had filled Spain Gaul and Italy from the Alps to the strait with mo numents of his mighty achievements who was at the head of an army equally experienced in service with himself hardened by having gone through every kind of difficulty even beyond what men could be supposed to endure which had been stained numberless times with Roman blood and had carried with them the spoils not only of Roman soldiers but of Roman com manders that many would meet Scipio in battle who with their own hands had slain pretors generals and consuls who in fine were decorated with the highest military honors accustomed as they were to ravage camps and the cities of Italy and that the magistrates HISTORY OF ROME BOOK XXX 263 of the Roman people were not in possession of such a number of fasces as Hannibal could have carried be fore him of those which had been taken from the gene rals who had fallen by his arms While their thoughts were employed in these discouraging considerations their anxiety and fears were farther aggravated by other circumstances for after being accustomed during several years to wage war in different parts of Italy without any sanguine hopes or prospect of its speedy conclusion Scipio and Hannibal champions matched as it were for the final decision had now raised their eagerest attention Even those who had the greatest confidence in Scipio and the strongest hopes of vic tory the nearer they saw the completion of their wishes the more was their solicitude heightened In a similar manner were the minds of the Carthaginians affected who when they turned their eyes on Hanni bal and the greatness of his exploits repented that they had sued for peace Then recollecting that they had been twice vanquished in battle that Syphax had been made prisoner that they had been expelled from Spain and finally that they had been obliged to quit Italy for the defence of their own shores and that all this had been effected by the valor and conduct of Sci pio alone they looked on him with terror as a leader whose birth the fates had ordained for their destruc tion 29 Hannibal in the mean time arrived at Hadru metum and spent a few days there in refreshing his soldiers after the fatigues of the voyage when roused by the alarming accounts that all the country round Carthage was possessed by the enemy s troops he ad vanced by long marches to Zama which lies at the dis tance of five days journey from that city Some spies whom he sent out being intercepted by the Roman guards and brought to Scipio he gave them in charge to the military tribunes with orders to conduct them through the camp wherever they chose he encouraged them to lay aside fear and view every thing and then inquiring whether they had taken a satisfactory view of 264 LIVY every particular he gave them an escort back to Han nibal Hannibal received no pleasure from any of their accounts They informed him that Masinissa hap pened to arrive that very day with six thousand foot and four thousand horse and he was particularly struck by the confidence of the enemy which he well knew was not conceived without reason Wherefore although he was himself the cause of the war and had by his coming occasioned the violation of the truce and the breaking off the negotiations yet thinking that he might obtain more reasonable terms by suing for peace while his strength was intire than after being discomfited he sent a message to Scipio requesting a conference Whether he took this step on his own judgment or by the order of the government I cannot take on me to affirm Valerius Antias says that after he had been defeated by Scipio in the first engagement in which twelve thousand fighting men were slain and one thousand seven hundred taken he came as ambas sador with ten others into the camp to Scipio Scipio did not decline the conference and the two generals by concert moved forward their camps in order that they might he more conveniently meet Scipio sat down at a small distance from the city Nedagara in a spot every way commodious besides having water within a javelin s cast Hannibal took possession of a hill four miles distant safe and convenient in all re spects except that there was no water near In the space between them a spot was chosen open to view on all sides that there might be no room for treachery 30 Their armed attendants having retired to an equal distance on both sides here met each attended by a single interpreter the two greatest generals not only of the age they lived in but of all who have been recorded in any former time and equal to any of the kings or commanders of any nations whatever On sight of each other they both stood for some time silent struck dumb as it were by mutual admiration At length Hannibal began thus  Since it has been so ordered by fate that I who first commenced hostilities HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXX 265 against the Roman people and have so often been on the point of making a conquest of them should volun tarily come to sue for peace I am glad that it is to you rather than to any other person that I am to ap ply On your part too among the many illustrious events of your life it ought not to be reckoned the least glorious that Hannibal to whom the gods granted victory over so many Roman generals has yielded to you and that you put an end to this war which was first rendered remarkable by the calamities of your country before it was so by those of ours Here also we may observe the sport of fortune in he disposal of events that in the consulate of your father I took up arms He was the first Roman general with whom I engaged in battle and to his son I now come unarmed to solicit peace It were indeed above all things to be wished that the gods had so disposed the minds of our fathers that your countrymen had been contented with the dominion of Italy and ours with that of Africa for even on your side Sicily and Sardinia are not an adequate compensation for the loss of so many fleets so many armies so many excellent generals But what is past however it may be blamed cannot be retrieved Our attempts on the possessions of others have ended in our being necessitated to fight in defence of our own Thus we not only brought war home to you in Italy but to ourselves in Africa You beheld the arms and ensigns of an enemy almost within your gates and on your walls and we now from the ramparts of Car thage hear the din of a Roman camp The event there fore for which we ought most earnestly to pray and you to wish above all things now comes in view you are negotiating a peace in the midst of a successful career We who negotiate are the persons most in terested in its establishment and whose stipulations whatever they may be will certainly be ratified by our respective states We want nothing but a disposition not averse from pacific counsels For my part so much instruction have 1 received from age returning now an old man to my country which I left a boy and also 266 LIVY both from prosperity and adversity that I wish to fol low reason rather than fortune But your early time of life and uninterrupted flow of prosperity both apt to inspire a degree of warmth ill suited to peaceful plans excite in my mind very serious apprehensions He whom fortune has never deceived rarely considers the uncertainty of future events What I was at Thra symenus and at Cannae that you are at present Ap pointed to a command at an age scarcely fit for service though your enterprises were of the boldest nature you were ever successful By avenging the death of your father and uncle you acquired a distinguished character for uncommon bravery and filial duty You recovered Spain which had been lost and drove out of it four Carthaginian armies On being elected consul when others wanted spirit sufficient to defend Italy you passed into Africa and by there destroying two armies by taking and burning two camps in one hour by making a captive of Syphax a most powerful king and by seizing on so many of his cities and so many of ours you compelled me to relinquish the possession of Italy which I had continued to hold for sixteen years Perhaps your wishes tend rather to conquest than to peace I know the spirit of you Romans that it ever aims at grand rather than useful objects For tune once shone on me with the same benign counte nance But if along with prosperity the gods would grant us a sound judgment we should consider not only what had already happened but what may pos sibly happen hereafter Although you should forget all other instances I am a sufficient example of every kind of fortune Me whom you formerly saw pitching my camp between the Anio and your city and on the point of scaling the walls of Rome you now behold here under the walls of my native city which is threat ened with a siege deprived of my two brothers gene rals of consummate skill and valor  deprecating in be half of my own city those calamities by which formerly I struck terror into yours The most exalted state of fortune is ever the least to be relied on A peace con HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXX 267 eluded at a juncture wherein your affairs florish and ours are distressed reflects splendor and dignity on you who grant it to ns who request it it is rather ne cessary than honorable A certain peace is better and safer than a victory in expectation the former is in your own disposal the latter in that of the gods Risk not on the chance of one hour the happy successes of so many years When you consider your own strength recollect at the same time the chances of war Arms there will be on both sides but on both sides the bodies that contend will be but human Events less correspond to men s expectations in war than in any other case whatever Even supposing that you should gain the victory in battle the proportion of glory which you would thereby acquire in addition to what yon may now securely enjoy on granting peace would bo by no means commensurate to that which you must lose should any misfortune happen to you The chance of but a single hour may destroy at once both the honors which you have attained and those for which you hope In the adjusting of matters every thing Publius Scipio will be in your own power in the other case you must abide by the pleasure of the gods Formerly Marcus Atilius in this same land would have been celebrated among the few most extraordinary examples of bravery and success had he when possessed of victory granted peace to the request of our fathers but by setting no bounds to his ambition by laying no restraint on his passions in proportion to the height of glory to which he had attained was his fall dishonorable Certainly it is his right who grants peace not his who sues for it to prescribe the terms yet perhaps we might not be deemed altogether inadequate to the estimation of what degree of punishment should be inflicted on us We are ready to give up to you the possession of all those places on account of which the war was begun Sicily Sardinia Spain with all the islands that lie in any part of the sea between Africa and Italy Let us Car thaginians confined within the shores of Africa behold you since such is the will of the gods extending your 208 LI VY sovereignty both by land and sea over foreign realms I am far from denying that you have some reason to distrust the faith of the Carthaginians on account of the insincerity which they showed in their solicitations and in not waiting the issue of the negotiation Scipio the security of a peace being observed depends much on the character of those who sue for it Your senate I hear refused to grant it partly from the considera tion that the persons employed in the embassy were not sufficiently respectable Hannibal sues for peace who would not sue for it unless he thought it expedient and who on account of the same expediency which in duces him to sue for it will also maintain it And as because the war was begun by me I took effectual care until the gods themselves declared against me that my countrymen should have no reason to com plain of it so will I exert my utmost endeavors to make them satisfied with a peace procured by any means 31 The Roman general answered to this effect Hannibal it was not unknown to me that their ex pectation of your arrival was what urged the Cartha ginians to violate the truce subsisting and to break off the treaty of peace Nor do you dissemble it as you deduct from the former conditions every particular except those which are for some time past in our own power But as you are solicitous that your coun trymen should understand how great a burden they are relieved from by your means so it is my bu siness to endeavor that they shall not now retract the concessions which they then agreed to make and enjoy what they then ceded as a reward of their perfidy Unworthy of being allowed the same terms you require additional advantages in consequence of your treachery Neither were our fathers the ag gressors in the war of Sicily nor we in that of Spain In the former case the danger of their allies the Mamertines in the latter the destruction of Sa guntum armed us in the cause of justice and of duty That you were the aggressors you yourself acknow HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXX lege and the gods bear witness to it who directed the issue of the former war according to equity and who are now directing and will bring the present to the same issue As to myself I am sensible of the instability of human affairs I am mindful of the power of fortune and I know that all our under takings are subject to a thousand casualties But as on the other hand if yon were retiring from Italy of your own accord and after embarking your troops were come to solicit peace if in that case I refused to listen to you I should acknowlege that I behaved with pride and arrogance so on the other hand now that I have dragged you into Africa in spite of every effort which you used to prevent it I am not bound to show you any particular respect If therefore in ad dition to the terms on which it was then intended to conclude a peace and with which you are acquainted a full compensation be proposed for having seized our ships and stores during the subsistence of a truce and for the insult offered to my ambassadors I shall then have matter to lay before my council But if this also seem severe prepare for war since you must be insin cere in proposing peace Thus without coming to any accommodation they retired to their respective armies and informed them that words had been tried to no purpose that the business must be decided by arms and they must abide the fortune which the gods should allot them 32 Arrived at their camps both gave orders to their soldiers to get ready their arms and call forth their courage for a decisive contest in which if suc cess attended them they would secure a superiority not for a day but for ever That it would be seen before to morrow night whether Rome or Carthage was to give laws to all nations for not Africa nor Italy but the world was to be the prize of victory while the calamities to those who should be overcome were proportionate to the prize for as on the one hand the Romans had no chance of escaping in a fo reign and to them unknown country so on the 270 LIVY other Carthage having exhausted her ast resources seemed to be threatened with immediate ruin Next day advanced two by far the most illustrious generals and two most puissant armies of the two most power ful states to complete the splendid fabric of glory which they had erected and which each was desirous of securing to himself The minds of all were anxi ously suspended between hope and fear and whilst they viewed at one time their own at another the enemy s army estimating their powers either by the eye or judgment they met with objects both of encou ragement and of dread Such as did not occur to their own thoughts were suggested by the generals in their admonitions and exhortations The Carthaginian re counted the exploits of sixteen years in the heart of Italy so many Roman generals so many armies ut terly destroyed and when he came to any soldier who had been distinguished for his behavior in a for mer battle he reminded him of the honors which ha had received Scipio called to his men s recollection Spain the late engagements in Africa and the ac knowlegement of the enemy that they had been com pelled by their fears to sue for peace which yet the natural perfidy of their disposition would not allow them to establish He related also his conference with Hannibal which as it had passed in secret he might have misrepresented at his pleasure He mentioned as an encouraging omen that as they were coming out to battle the gods had shown them the same por tents under the auspices of which their fathers had fought at the islands Egates The end of the war and of all their toils he said was now at hand they had within their reach the plunder of Carthage and might speedily return home to their country to their parents their children their wives and their household gods These words he uttered in an erect attitude and with a countenance so animated with joy that he seemed as if he had already obtained the vic tory S3 He then drew up the spearmen in the van be HISTORY OF ROME BOOK XXX 27V hind them the first rank men and closed the rear with the veterans He did not as usual form the cohorts in close order each before their own colors but placed the companies at some distance from each other that there might be room to admit the elephants of the enemy without disturbing the ranks Laelius who formerly served under him as lieutenant general but that year as questor by particular appointment in pursuance of a decree of the senate he posted with the Italian cavalry on the left wing Masinissa and the Numidians on the right The openings between the companies of the cohorts he filled up with light armed troops and gave them directions on the attack of the elephants either to retire to the rear of the files or opening to right and left to form along with the cohorts so as to leave a passage for those beasts through which they might advance exposed on both sides to their weapons Hannibal in order to strike terror placed his elephants in the front of these there were eighty a number greater than he had ever before brought into the field next to them the auxiliary Li gurians and Gauls with the Balearians and Moors in termixed In the second line he placed the Carthagi nians Africans and the legion of Macedonians and then leaving a moderate interval he formed the line of reserve consisting of Italian soldiers chiefly Brut tians a greater number of whom followed him on his departure from Italy by compulsion and through ne cessity rather than from inclination He also covered the flanks with cavalry the Carthaginians being posted on the right the Numidians on the left Various were the methods of encouragement made use of among such a number of men differing from each other in language in manners in laws in arms in garb in temper and in their motives for engaging in the ser vice To the auxiliaries was held out present gain and that to be greatly increased by future plunder The Gauls were inflamed by rousing their peculiar and na tural hatred to the Romans To the Ligurians who had been brought down from craggy mountains the fertile 272 livy plains of Italy were pointed out as the reward of suc cess The Moors and Numidians he terrified with the prospect of cruel tyranny under Masinissa Different objects of hope and fear were proposed to each but to the Carthaginians nothing but extremes either on the side of hope or of fear was presented to view the walls of their native city their household gods the sepulchres of their ancestors their children pa rents and wives distracted with terror in a word utter ruin and abject slavery or the empire of the world While the general was thus employed among the Carthaginians and the commanders of the several nations among their respective countrymen many of them speaking by interpreters being intermixed with foreigners the trumpets and cornets sounded on the side of the Romans and such a shout was raised that the elephants particularly in the left wing turned about against their own men the Moors and Numi dians Masinissa charging them while in disorder easily drove them in and stripped their line on that flank of the cover of the cavalry However a few of these beasts unaffrighted being driven forward on the Romans made great slaughter among the light troops but not without receiving many wounds for springing back to the companies and to avoid being trodden under foot opening a passage for the elephants they discharged their spears at them from both sides being intirely exposed as they passed through  nor did the javelins from the first line of troops cease until being driven away from the Roman line by the weapons showered on them they put to flight even the Cartha ginian cavalry in their own right wing Ltelius see ing the enemy in this confusion charged their dis ordered troops and put them to flight 34 The Carthaginian line was exposed on both flanks not having cavalry to cover them when the infantry began to engage but no longer on an equa lity with the Roman either in hope or in strength There was another circumstance which though trifling in appearance is yet of great consequence in action HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXX 273 The shout on the side of the Romans was composed of the same sounds uttered by every one consequently it was the stronger and more terrible on the other side the sounds were dissonant uttered in the dis cordant languages of many different nations Be sides the Roman manner of fighting was steady being accustomed to press against the enemy with their own weight and that of their arms That of the Carthaginian was more loose with greater agility than strength Immediately therefore at the first onset the Romans made the line of the enemy give way and then thrusting against them with their elbows and the bosses of their shields and stepping forward into the place from which they had pushed them they rapidly gained ground The rear ranks also on per ceiving the enemy s line shrink pushed forward those who were before them which greatly increased their force in repelling the enemy On the other side the Africans and Carthaginians so far from supporting the auxiliaries who were giving way drew back fearing lest if that first line made an obstinate resistance the enemy in cutting through those might close with them The auxiliaries therefore quickly turned their backs and facing about to their own party some of them re treated into the second line others who were not re ceived there made use of their arms against them enraged at not having been supported before and at being now excluded So that there were in a man ner two battles carried on together the Carthagi nians being obliged to engage in fight and at the same time both with their mercenaries and with the Ro mans They did not however admit those craven soldiers into their line which was still firm and fresh but closing the ranks drove them off to the wings and to the open plains round the field of battle The place where the auxiliaries had lately stood was filled up with such a number of slain and such a quantity of arms that it was rather more difficult to make way through them than it had been through the body of troops the spearmen however who were in the van liv vol v s r 274 livy pursuing the enemy as each could find a passage through the heaps of carcases and weapons and streams of blood disordered both their battalions and ranks The battalions of the first rank men also seeing the line before them in confusion began to waver which as soon as Scipio observed he instantly ordered a retreat to be sounded for the spearmen and carrying off the wounded to the rear brought up the first rank men and veterans to the wings in order that the line of the spearmen in the centre might be the more se cure and firm Thus was a new battle begun for they had now come up to their real antagonists who were on an equality with them both in respect to the kind of arms which they used of their experience in war the fame of their exploits and the greatness both of their hopes and dangers But the Romans had the ad vantage in number and also in spirit as having already routed the cavalry and the elephants and after having defeated the first line engaging now with the second 35 Laelius and Masinissa who had pursued the flying cavalry to some distance returning at this cri tical juncture fell on the rear of the enemy and by this charge effectually routed them Many were sur rounded in the field and slain many being dispersed in flight through the open country adjoining where the cavalry were intirely masters perished in various places Of the Carthaginians and their allies there were slain on that day above twenty thousand about the same number were taken with a hundred and thirty three military standards and eleven elephants Of the conquerors there fell two thousand Hannibal escaping during the confusion with a few horsemen fled to Hadrumetum having left no effort untried to rally his troops before he left the field Scipio him self and all who were skilled in the military art al lowed him the merit of having made the disposition of his forces with singular judgment placing the ele phants in the front in order that their ungoverned onset and insupportable violence might put it out of the power of the Romans to follow their ensigns and pre HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXX 275 serve their ranks in which they placed their chief confidence  then the auxiliaries before the line of Car thaginians in order that these men made up of the refuse of all nations who were retained in their duty not by any sense of honor but by gain should have no prospect of safety in flight and at the same time should stand the first brunt and fury of the foe that if they did no other service they might at least be as shields to blunt their swords next the Carthaginian and African soldiers in whom lay all his hopes in order that they being equal in all respects with the Romans might have the advantage of engaging fresh against men fatigued and wounded separating the Italians at some distance from the rest and placing them in the rear as he knew not with certainty whe ther they were friends or foes Hannibal after ex erting this last effort of bravery having fled to Ha drumetum on receiving a summons returned to Car thage in the thirty sixth year after he had left it and when a boy He acknowleged in the senate house that he was vanquished not only in the recent battle but in the whole of the war and that there was no other hope of avoiding ruin but in obtaining peace 36 Immediately after the battle Scipio having taken and plundered the enemy s camp returned with immense booty to the sea coast to his fleet having received an account that Publius Lentulus was arrived at Utica with fifty ships of war a hundred transports and store of all kinds With a view therefore of in creasing the consternation at Carthage by showing them objects of terror on every side after despatching Laelius to Rome with news of the victory he ordered Cneius Octavius to conduct the legions to that city by land and joining the fleet of Lentulus lately arrived with his own which he had before he himself setting sail from Utica steered for the harbor of Carthage When he had arrived within a small distance he was met by a Carthaginian ship dressed with fillets and branches of olive on board of which were ten ambas sadors the chief men of the state sent by the advice 276 livy of Hannibal to sue for peace These coming under the stern of the general s ship holding out the badges of supplicants besought and implored the favor and compassion of Scipio but they received no other an swer than that they should come to Tunes to which place he intended to remove his camp Then after taking a view of the situation of Carthage not so much for the sake of any present use which he in tended to make of his knowlege of it as of dispiriting the enemy he returned to Utica and at the same time recalled Octavius thither As they advanced towards Tunes an account was brought that Vermina son of Syphax with a greater number of horse than of foot was coming to the aid of the Carthaginians A de tachment of the army with all the cavalry attacking this body of Numidians on their march on the first day of the Saturnalia routed them without much diffi culty and every possibility of flight being cut off by the surrounding cavalry fifteen thousand men were slain one thousand two hundred taken together with fifteen hundred horses and seventy two military standards The prince himself with very few attend ants made his escape during the tumult The camp was then pitched near Tunes in the same place as be fore whither thirty ambassadors came from Carthage to Scipio and the behavior of these was much more calculated to excite compassion than that of the former as their distress was still increasing But from the recollection of their late perfidy they were heard with the less pity In the council though all were stimu lated by just resentment to pursue Carthage to de struction yet when they considered how great an un dertaking it was and what a length of time the siege of a city so strong and so well fortified would re quire Scipio himself also being uneasy under the apprehension of a successor being appointed in his place who might claim the glory of having terminated the war though it had been actually brought to an issue by the labors and dangers of another they all became inclined to peace HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXX 277 37 The next day the ambassadors being again called and with severe rebukes for their perfidy admonished that instructed by so many calamities they should at length be convinced of the regard due to the gods and to an oath these terms of peace were prescribed to them â That they should live free under their own laws should enjoy the possession of whatever cities whatever territories and whatever boundaries they possessed before the war and that the Roman general would on that day put an end to the devastation of their country That they should deliver up to the Romans all deserters fugitives and prisoners and should surrender their ships of war except ten together with all their trained elephants and should not train any more That they should wage no war either in or out of Africa without the permission of the Roman people should make resti tution to Masinissa and conclude a treaty with him should supply corn and pay to the auxiliaries until their ambassadors should return from Rome That they should pay within fifty years ten thousand ta lents of silver i by equal payments according to a mode laid down in writing and should give a hundred hostages to be approved of by Scipio none younger than fourteen years or older than thirty That he would grant them a truce on this condition that the transports which had been captured during the former truce together with their cargoes be restored if this were not complied with they were not to expect either truce or peace When the ambassadors who were sent home with these conditions reported them in an assembly of the people Gisgo having stood forth to dissuade them from accepting the terms and being listened to by the multitude who were as impatient of quiet as unfit for war Hannibal filled with indigna tion on finding objections made and listened to at such a juncture laid hold of Gisgo with his hand and pulled him down from the place on which he stood  1 437 500 278 LIVY When this sight unusual in a free state raised a mur mur among the citizens he being accustomed to mili tary manners and disconcerted by their reception of him said to them At nine years of age I left this city at the end of the thirty sixth I have returned The rules of war I think I perfectly understand having from my childhood been continually supplied with opportunities of learning them at some times by the state of my own affairs at others by that of the public The privileges laws and manners of the city and of the forum you ought to teach me Having thus apologised for his imprudence he spoke at large concerning the peace showing how necessary it was and that the terms were not unreasonable The great est difficulty of all was that of the fleet which had been captured during the truce nothing was to be found but the ships themselves nor was it easy to col lect the effects those who were charged with having them in their possession making opposition to all that was proposed It was at length resolved that the ships should be restored that the men at all events should be collected and that the other matters which could not be produced should be left to the valuation of Scipio according to which the Carthaginians should make compensation in money Some say that Han nibal having gone from the field to the sea coast sailed immediately in a ship which had been prepared and went to king Antiochus and that when Scipio made it a principal demand that Hannibal should be given up to him he was told that Hannibal had quitted Africa 38 On the return of the ambassadors to Scipio the questors were ordered to give in a return extracted from the public accounts of the public property which had been on board the ships and the owners to make a return of the private property for the amount of the value twenty five thousand pounds weight of sil ver were required to be immediately paid and a truce for three months was granted to the Carthaginians A clause was added that during the truce they should HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXX 279 not send ambassadors to any other place than to Rome and that if any such should come to Carthage they should not dismiss them until the Roman general was made acquainted with their business With the Car thaginian ambassadors were sent to Rome Lucius Ve turius Philo Marcius Ralla and Lucius Scipio the general s brother From that time the great supplies from Sicily and Sardinia caused such cheapness of provisions that the merchant often furnished corn to the mariners for the freight At Rome there had been some uneasiness on the first account of the Carthagi nians having recommenced hostilities and Tiberius Claudius had been ordered to conduct the fleet to Sicily with all expedition and to pass over from thence to Carthage and the other consul Marcus Servilius to remain in the city until the state of affairs in Africa should be known Tiberius Claudius pro ceeded slowly in every step towards the equipment and sailing of the fleet being offended at the senate having voted that Scipio in preference to the consul should have the honor of prescribing the terms of peace Accounts of prodigies also arriving a little before the news of the revival of hostilities had raised people s apprehensions At Cumae the orb of the sun seemed to be diminished and a shower of stones fell and in the district of Veliturnum the earth sunk in great chasms in which trees were swallowed At Ari cia the forum and shops round it at Frusino several parts of the wall and a gate were struck by lightning On the Palatine hill too a shower of stones fell This prodigy according to the method handed down by tra dition was expiated by a nine days solemnity the others by the greater victims Among the rest an unusual overflowing of the rivers was also considered as a prodigy for there was such an inundation of the Tiber that the circus being filled with water prepa rations for the games of Apollo were made on the out side of the Colline gate near the temple of Venus Erycina But on the very day of the games the weather suddenly clearing up the procession which 280 LIVY had begun to advance towards the Colline gate was recalled and conducted to the circus on its being known that the water had retired from thence Its own proper place being thus restored to this solemn exhibition gave much joy to the people and added considerably to the splendor of the games 39 The consul Claudius having at last set out from the city was overtaken by a violent storm between the ports of Cosa and Laureta and brought into immi nent danger however having got as far as Populonii where he continued until a change of weather he pro ceeded to the island Ilva from Ilva to Corsica and from thence to Sardinia There as he was sailing by the Mad Mountains a still more furious tempest sur prised him and dispersed his fleet Many ships were damaged and lost their rigging and several were wrecked In this harassed and shattered condition the fleet arrived at Carales where the winter came on them while they were employed in docking and re pairing the ships Meanwhile the year coming to a conclusion and it not being proposed to continue him in command Tiberius Claudius after he had ceased to hold any public office brought home the fleet Marcus Servilius having nominated Caius Servilius Geminus dictator lest he might be recalled on account of the elections set out for his province The dictator named Publius jElius Paetus master of the horse The elections though many days were appointed for the purpose were still prevented by storms so that the magistrates of the former year going out of office on the day preceding the ides of March and no suc cessors being appointed the state was without curule magistrates Lucius Manlius Torquatus a pontiff died that year in his place was substituted Caius Sulpicius Gallia The Roman games were thrice re peated intire by the curule ediles Lucius Licinius Lu cullus and Quintus Fulvius Some of the inferior officers belonging to the ediles being convicted on the testimony of a discoverer of having secretly conveyed money out of the treasury were condemned not with HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXX 281 out reflecting dishonor on the edile Lucullus Publius yElius Tubero and Lucius Lsetorius plebeian ediles on some irregularity being discovered in their election abdicated their office after they bad celebrated the games and on occasion thereof a feast to Jupiter having also erected in the capitol three images formed of silver raised by fines The dictator and master of the horse in pursuance of a decree of the senate cele brated the games of Ceres 40 When the Roman deputies together with the Carthaginian ambassadors were come to Rome from Africa the senate assembled in the temple of Bellona Lucius Veturius Philo acquainted them to the great joy of the fathers that a battle had been fought with Hannibal in which the Carthaginians were finally overpowered and an end put at last to that disastrous war he added as a small accession to that great and happy event that Vermina son of Syphax had also been vanquished He was then ordered to go out to the general assembly and to communicate the joy ful news to the people On this after mutual congra tulations a public thanksgiving being ordered all the temples in the city were thrown open and a supplica tion for three days decreed The ambassadors of the Carthaginians and of king Philip for they also had arrived requesting an audience of the senate the dic tator answered by order of the fathers that the new consuls would procure them an audience The elec tions were then held A U C 051 B C 201 The consuls elected were Cneius Cornelius Lentulns and Publius jElius Pa tus the pretors Marcus Junius Pennns to whom the city jurisdiction fell Marcus Valerius Falto acquired by lot Bruttium  Marcus Fa bius Buteo Sardinia Publius jElius Tubero Sicily With respect to the provinces of the consuls it was determined that nothing should be done until the am bassadors of king Philip and the Carthaginians were heard for it was plainly foreseen that the conclusion of the one war would be quickly followed by the com mencement of another The consul Cneius Lenlulus 282 livy was inflamed with a strong desire of obtaining the pro vince of Africa having in view either an easy con quest or if it were now to be concluded the glory of terminating so great a war in his consulate He de clared therefore that he would not suffer any busi ness to be done until Africa were decreed to him for his colleague declined putting in his claim for it being a moderate prudent man who perceived that a contest with Scipio for that honor besides being unjust would be also unequal Quintus Minucius Thermus and Mauius Acilius Glabrio tribunes of the people said that Cneius Cornelius was endeavoring to carry a point which had been attempted in vain the year be fore by the consul Tiberius Claudius that by the direction of the senate the question had been proposed to the people respecting the command in Africa and that the thirty five tribes unanimously decreed that command to Publius Scipio The affair after being canvassed with much heat both in the senate and in the assembly of the people was at last brought to this conclusion â that it should be left to the de termination of the former The fathers therefore on oath for so it had been agreed voted that the consuls should settle between themselves or cast lots for their provinces which of them should have Italy and which a fleet of fifty ships That he to whose lot it fell to command the ffeet should sail to Sicily and if peace could not be concluded with the Carthagi nians should pass over from thence to Africa where he the said consul should command at sea and Scipio on land with the same extent of authority as hereto fore If the terms of peace should be agitated that then the tribunes should take the opinion of the peo ple whether they would order the consul or Publius Scipio to settle those terms and if the victorious army was to be conducted home whom they would order to do it If they should order the peace to be granted by Publius Scipio and the army also to be brought home by him that then the consul should not cross over from Sicily to Africa That the other consul to HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXX 283 whose lot Italy fell should receive two legions from Marcus Sextius pretor 41 Publius Scipio s command in the province of Africa was prolonged with the armies which he then had To Marcus Valerius Falto pretor were decreed the two legions in Bruttium which Caius Livius had commanded the preceding year Publius jElius pre tor was to receive two legions in Sicily from Cneius Tremellius One legion which had been under Pub lius Lentulus propretor was decreed to Marcus Fa bius for Sardinia The command in Etruria was con tinued to Marcus Servilius consul of the former year with his own two legions With regard to Spain the senate ordered that whereas Lucius Cornelius Lentu lus and Lucius Manlius Acidinus had remained in that country for several years the consuls should therefore make application to the tribunes that if they thought proper they should ask the people whom they would order to have charge in Spain and that the person so ordered should collect such a number of Romans out of the two armies as would make up one legion and as many of the allies of the Latine confederacy as would form fifteen cohorts with which he should conduct the business of the province and that Lu cius Cornelius and Lucius Manlius shall lead home the veteran soldiers to Italy To the consul Cornelius was decreed a squadron of fifty ships out of the two fleets one of which was under Cneius Octavins in Africa the other under Publius Vellius guarding the coast of Sicily with liberty to take such of those ves sels as he might please It was also decreed that Publius Scipio should keep the fifty ships of war on his station as before and that if Cneius Octavius chose to conti nue in the command of these as heretofore he should have it for that year as propretor that if Laelius should be set at the head of the fleet then Octavius should return to Rome and bring home such ships as the proconsul had not occasion for Ten ships of war were also decreed to Marcus Fabius for Sardinia and the consuls were ordered to enlist two legions for the 284 LIVY city so that the state should have in its service for that year fourteen legions and one hundred and ten ships of war 42 The next business attended to was that of the envoys of Philip and the Carthaginians It was thought proper that the Macedonians should be first introduced Their discourse comprehended a variety of subjects they first endeavored to clear themselves of those matters of which the ambassadors sent from Rome to the king had complained relative to the de predations committed on the allies Then on their part they remonstrated on the conduct of the allies of the Romans and particularly on that of Marcus Aurelius who they said being one of the three am bassadors sent to them had stayed behind the rest levied soldiers committed hostilities against them and fought several pitched battles with their commanders They afterwards demanded that the Macedonians and their captain Sopater who had served for pay under Hannibal and having been made prisoners were still detained might be restored to them In opposition to this Marcus Furius who had been sent from Macedo nia to Aurelius for the purpose asserted that  Aure lius had been directed to take care lest the allies wearied out by insults and depredations should go over to the king that he had not gone beyond the boundaries of the confederated states but had endea vored to prevent devastations being committed with impunity within their territories  that Sopater was one of the king s particular favorites one of those distin guished with the purple and that he had been lately sent with four thousand men and a sum of money into Africa to the assistance of Hannibal and the Carthagi nians The Macedonians being interrogated on these points and not giving any clear answers the senate without farther discussion told them that the king was seeking war and if he persisted would quickly find it That the treaty had been doubly violated by him first in offering injury to the allies of the Ro man people assaulting them in open hostilities se HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXX 285 condly in assisting their enemies with troops and money That Publius Scipio had acted and was act ing properly and regularly in treating as foes and throwing into confinement those who were taken in arms against the Roman people and that Marcus Au relius did his duty to the state and in a manner agree able to the senate in protecting the allies of the Ro man people by arms since he could not do it by the authority of the treaty The Macedonians being dis missed with this severe answer the Carthaginian am bassadors were called on sight of whose ages and dignities every one was ready to observe that they were now in earnest in their application for peace for that these were by far the most respectable persons of their nation Hasdrnbal by his countrymen surnamed Haedus was distinguished above the rest having always recommended peace and opposed the Barcine faction On that account great attention was paid to him when he transferred the blame of the war from the state on the ambition of a few After discoursing on various heads at one time refuting charges which had been made against them at another acknow leging some lest by denying what was manifestly true he might render forgiveness more difficult and then going so far as to admonish the conscript fathers to show mildness and moderation in prosperity he added that if the Carthaginians had listened to him and Hanno and made a proper use of occurrences as they happened they would have been in a condition of prescribing terms instead of begging a peace as they now did but men were seldom blessed with good for tune and a good understanding at the same time That the Roman people were therefore invincible be cause when successful they never lost sight of the maxims of wisdom and prudence and indeed it would have been surprising had they acted other wise while those who are unaccustomed to success unable to restrain their transports run into extrava gance To the Roman people the joy of victory was now habitual and almost a matter of course and they 286 LIVY had enlarged their empire more hy their lenity to the vanquished than by their victories The discourse of the others was more calculated to excite compassion they represented  to what a low state from an exalted height the affairs of the Carthaginians had fallen That they who had lately extended the power of their arms over almost the whole world had now little left them except the walls of Carthage Shut up within these they could see nothing either on land or sea that they could call their own Even of the city itself and of their habitations they had no other tenure than the Romans not choosing to wreak their ven geance on those also when no other object for it now remained When it appeared that the fathers were moved by compassion one of the senators it is said incensed at the perfidy of the Carthaginians called out to them and asked  What gods they would now invoke as witnesses in the pending treaty having broken faith with those in whose name the former one was concluded â The same said Hasdrubal who now show such resentment against the violators of treaties 43 The minds of all inclining to peace Cneius Len tulus consul whose province was the fleet protested against the senate passing a decree On which the tri bunes Manius Acilius and Quintus Manucius put the question to the people  Whether they would choose and order the senate to decree that peace should be made with the Carthaginians whom they would order to grant peace and whom to conduct the armies home from Africa All the tribes unanimously passed the question as it was put and ordered Publius Scipio to grant the peace and also to conduct the armies home In consequence of this order of the people the senate decreed that Publius Scipio in consort with the ten ambassadors should conclude a peace with the people of Carthage on such terms as he should judge proper The Carthaginians then after returning thanks to the senate requested that they might be permitted to enter the city and to converse with their countrymen who HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXX 287 having been made prisoners were still kept so among whom some of them had relations and friends men of distinction and to others they had messages from their relations After a meeting with their friends on making a second request that liberty might be allowed them to ransom such of them as they chose they were or dered to give in a list of their names and when they had given in about two hundred a decree of the senate was passed that the Roman ambassadors should carry two hundred of the prisoners such as the Carthagi nians should select into Africa to Publius Cornelius Scipio and give him directions that if peace were concluded he should restore them without ransom to the Carthaginians The heralds being ordered to go to Africa to ratify the treaty at their desire the senate passed a decree in these words that they should carry with them flint stones of their own and vervain of their own that the Roman commander should give them the order to strike the treaty and that they should call on him for the herbs This was a kind of herb brought from the capital and given to the heralds on such occasions The deputies being dismissed from Rome in this manner as soon as they came to Scipio in Africa concluded a peace on the terms before men tioned The Carthaginians delivered up the ships of war elephants deserters fugitives and four thousand prisoners among whom was Quintus Terentius Culleo a senator The ships Scipio ordered to be carried out into the deep and burned Some say that they amounted to five hundred of all sorts which were worked with oars and that the sudden sight of these in flames was as great a shock to the Carthaginians as if Carthage itself had been set on fire The deserters were treated with more severity than the fugitives those who were of the Latine confederacy were be headed the Romans were crucified 44 The last peace with the Carthaginians had been made forty years before this in the consulate of Quin tus Lutatius and Aulus Manlins The late war began twenty three years after in the consulate of Publius 288  livy Cornelins and Tiberius Sempronius and ended in the seventeenth year when Cneius Cornelius and Publius jElius Paetus were consuls We are told that Scipio often said afterwards that the ambition first of Tibe rius Claudius and then of Cneius Cornelius was what prevented that war from ending in the utter destruc tion of Carthage The Carthaginians having been ex hausted by the long continuance of the late struggles found it difficult to raise the first contribution money so that the senate house was filled with grief and la mentations on which occasion it is said that Hanni bal was observed to laugh and that being reproved by Hasdrubal Haedus for laughing in a moment of public sorrowing and when he himself was the cause of their tears he said If the inward thoughts could be perceived in the same manner as the look of the countenance is perceived by the eye you would be immediately convinced that the laughter which you blame proceeds not from a heart elated with joy but from one driven almost to madness by misfortunes and yet it is not by any means so unseasonable as those absurd and inconsistent tears of yours Then ought you to have wept when our arms were taken from us our ships burned and we ourselves forbidden to engage in foreign wars that was the wound by which we fell And do not imagine that the measures taken against you by the Romans were dictated merely by animosity No great state can remain long at rest If it has no enemies abroad it finds them at home as overgrown bodies seem safe from external injuries but suffer grievous inconveniences from their own strength We feel it seems for the public misfor tunes only in proportion as our private affairs are affected by them and none of them stings more deeply than the loss of money Thus when the spoils were stripped off from vanquished Carthage and you saw her left naked among so many armed states of Africa not one of you uttered a groan  now because a contri bution must be made to the tribute out of your private properties you lament as if the existence of the state HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXX 289 were terminated Much I dread lest you quickly feel that the subject of your tears this day is the lightest of your misfortunes Such were Hannibal s sentiments which he delivered to the Carthaginians Scipio hav ing called an assembly bestowed on Masinissa in ad dition to his paternal kingdom the city of Cirtha and the other cities and lands belonging to the territories of Syphax which had fallen into the hands of the Ro man people He ordered Cneius Octavius to conduct the fleet to Sicily and deliver it to the consul Cneins Cornelius and the ambassadors of the Carthaginians to go to Rome in order that the terms stipulated for by him might be ratified by the authority of the senate and the order of the people 45 Peace being established by sea and land he em barked his army and carried it over to Lilybasum in Sicily and from thence sending a great part of his troops round by sea he himself landed in Italy As he proceeded through the country he found it no less delighted at finding there was an end to the war than at the success in it not only the inhabitants of the cities pouring out to show their respect to him but crowds of the country people also filling up the roads and thus he arrived at Rome where he entered the city in the most splendid triumph which had ever been beheld He carried into the treasury a hundred and twenty three thousand pounds weight of silver and out of the spoil distributed to each of his soldiers four hundred asses i The death of Syphax caused some diminution in the splendor of the show but none in the glory of the general who triumphed He died a short time before at Tibur to which place he had been removed from Alba His death however made some noise for he was honored with a public funeral Po lybius a writer of no contemptible authority asserts that this king was led in triumph Quintus Terentius Culleo followed Scipio in his triumph with a cap on his head s and through his whole life after as became him i 11 5s lOd 2 The symbol of liberty LIV VOL V T 290 LIVY he respected him as the author of his liberty I have not been able to discover whether it was the affection of the soldiers or the attachment of the people which honored Scipio with the surname of Africanus nor whether it was brought into use by the flattery of his friends as that of Felix given to Sylla and of Magnus to Pompey in the memory of our fathers He was certainly the first general distinguished by the title of a nation which he had subdued Others afterwards following his example though far inferior in the great ness of their achievements assumed pompous inscrip tions for their statues and splendid surnames for their families BOOK XXXI Chap 1 I feel a degree of pleasure in having come to the end of the Punic war as if myself had borne a share of the toil and danger for though it ill be comes a person who has ventured to promise an intire history of all the Roman affairs to be fatigued by any particular parts of so extensive a work yet when I reflect that sixty three years for so many there are from the first Punic war to the end of the second have filled up as many volumes for me as the four hundred and eighty seven years from the build ing of the city to the consulates of Appius Claudius who first made war on the Carthaginians I plainly per ceive that like those who are tempted by the shallows near the shore to walk into the sea the farther I ad vance I am carried into the greater depth and abyss as it were and that my work rather increases on my hands than diminishes as I expected it would by the first parts being completed The peace with Carthage HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXXI 291 was quickly followed by a war with Macedonia a war not to be compared with the former indeed either in danger or in the abilities of the commanders or the valor of the soldiers  but rather more remarkable with regard to the renown of their former kings the ancient fame of that nation and the vast extent of their em pire which formerly comprehended a large part of Europe and the greater part of Asia The contest with Philip which had begun about ten years before had been intermitted for the three last years the jEtolians having been the occasion both of the com mencement and of the cessation of hostilities The Romans being now disengaged from all employment and being incensed against Philip on account both of his infringing the peace with regard to the jEtolians and the other allies in those parts and also on account of his having lately sent aid of men and money into Africa to Hannibal and the Carthaginians were ex cited to a renewal of the war by the intreaties of the Athenians whose country he had ravaged and shut up the inhabitants within the walls of the city 2 About the same time ambassadors arrived both from king Attalus and from the Rhodians with infor mation that the Macedonian was tampering with the states of Asia To these embassies an answer was given that the senate would give attention to the affairs of Asia The determination with regard to the making war on him was left open to the consuls who were then in their provinces In the mean time three ambassadors were sent to Ptolemy king of Egypt namely Caius Claudius Nero Marcus jEmilius Lepi dus and Publius Sempronius Tuditanus to announce their conquest of Hannibal and the Carthaginians to give thanks to the king for his faithful adherence to his engagements in the time of their distress when even the nearest allies of the Romans abandoned them and to request that if they should be compelled by ill treatment to break with Philip he would preserve the same disposition towards the Roman people In Gaul about this time the consul Publius vElius having 292  LIVY heard that hefore his arrival the Boians had made in roads on the territories of the allies levied two occa sional legions on account of this disturbance and add ing to them four cohorts from his own army ordered Caius Oppius the prefect to march with this tumult uary band through Umbria which is called the Sap pinian district and to invade the territories of the Boians leading his own troops thither openly over the mountains which lay in the way Oppius on en tering the same for some time committed depredations with good success and safety But afterwards having pitched on a place near a fort called Mutilum conve nient enough for cutting down the corn which was now ripe and setting out without having acquired a knowlege of the country and without establishing armed posts of sufficient strength to protect those who were unarmed and intent on their work he was suddenly surrounded together with his foragers and attacked by the Gauls On this even those who were furnished with weapons struck with dismay betook themselves to flight Seven thousand men dispersed through the corn fields were put to the sword among whom was the commander himself Caius Oppius The rest were driven in confusion into the camp from whence in consequence of a resolution there formed they set out on the following night without any particular commander and leaving behind a great part of their baggage made their way through woods almost impas sable to the consul who returned to Rome without having performed any thing in his province worth no tice except that he ravaged the lands of the Boians and made a treaty with the Ingaunian Ligurians 3 The first time he assembled the senate it was unanimously ordered that he should propose no other business before that which related to Philip and the complaints of the allies it was of course immediately taken into consideration and in full meeting decreed that Publius jElius consul should send such person as he might think proper vested with command to re ceive the fleet which Cneius Octavius was bringing home HISTORY OF ROME BOOK XXXI 293 from Sicily and pass over to Macedonia Accord ingly Marcus Valerius Laevinus propretor was sent and receiving thirty eight ships from Cneius Octa vius near Vibo he sailed to Macedonia where being met by Marcus Aurelius the ambassador and in formed what numerous forces and what large fleets the king had prepared and how busily he was em ployed in prevailing on divers states to join him applying to some in person to others by agents not only through all the cities of the continent but even in the islands Laevinus was convinced from this that the war required vigorous exertions on the side of the Romans for should they be dilatory Philip might be encouraged to attempt an enterprise like to that which had been formerly undertaken by Pyrrhus who possessed not such large dominions He therefore de sired Aurelius to convey this intelligence by letter to the consuls and to the senate 4 Towards the end of this year the senate taking into consideration the lands to be given to the veteran soldiers who under the conduct and auspices of Pub lius Scipio had finished the war in Africa decreed that Marcus Tunius pretor of the city should if he thought proper appoint ten commissioners to survey and distribute among them that part of the Samnite and Apulian lands which was the property of the Ro man people For this purpose were appointed Pub lius Servilius Quintus Caecilius Metellus Caius and Marcus Servilius both surnamed Geminus Lucius and Aulus Hosfilins Cato Publius Villius Tappulus Marcus Fulvius Flaccus Publius JElius Partus and Quintus Flaminius At the same time Publius Elius presiding at the election of consuls Publius Sulpicius Galba and Caius Aurelius Cotta were elected Then were chosen pretors Quintus Minucius Rufus Lucius Furius Purpureo Quintus Fulvius Gillo Cneius Ser gius Plancus The Roman stage games were exhi bited in a sumptuous and elegant manner by the curule ediles Lucius Valerius Flaccus and Lucius Quintius Flaminius and repeated for two days and 294 livy a vast quantity of com which Scipio had sent from Africa was distributed by them to the people with strict impartiality and general satisfaction at the rate of four asses a peck The plebeian games were thrice repeated intire by the plebeian ediles Lucius Apus tius Fullo and Quintns Minucius Rufns the latter of whom was from the edileship elected pretor There was also a feast of Jove on occasion of the games 5 In the year five hundred and fifty two from the building of the city A U C 552 B C 200 Publius Sulpicius Galba and Caius Aurelius being consuls within a few months after the conclusion of the peace with the Carthaginians war began against king Philip This was the first business introduced by the consul Publius Sulpicius on the ides of March the day on which in those times the consuls entered into office and the senate decreed that the consuls should per form sacrifices with the greater victims to such gods as they should judge proper with prayers to this pur pose â that  the business which the senate and people of Rome had then under deliberation concerning the state and the entering on a new war might be attended with success and prosperity to the Roman people the allies and the Latine confederacy  and that after the sacrifices and prayers they should consult the senate on the state of public affairs and the provinces At this time very opportunely for promoting a war the letters were brought from Marcus Aurelius the am bassador and Marcus Valerius Laevinus propretor An embassy likewise arrived from the Athenians to acquaint them that the king was approaching their frontiers and that in a short time not only their lands but their city also must fall into his hands unless they received aid from the Romans When the con suls had made their report that the sacrifices had been duly performed and that the gods had accepted their prayers that the aruspices had declared that the en trails showed good omens and that enlargement of territory victory and triumph were portended the HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXXI 295 letters of Valerius and Aurelius were read and audi ence given to the ambassadors of the Athenians After which a decree of the senate was passed that thanks should be given to their allies because though long solicited they had not been prevailed on even by dread of a siege to depart from their engagements With regard to sending assistance to them they re solved that an answer should be given as soon as the consuls should have cast lots for the provinces and when the consul to whose lot Macedonia fell should have proposed to the people to declare war against Philip king of the Macedonians 6 The province of Macedonia fell by lot to Publius Sulpicius and he proposed to the people to declare that they chose and ordered that on account of the injuries and hostilities committed against the allies of the Roman people war should be proclaimed against king Philip and the Macedonians under his govern ment The province of Italy fell to the lot of the other consul Aurelius The pretors then cast lots to Cneius Sergius Plancus fell the city jurisdiction to Quintus Fulvius Gillo Sicily to Quintus Minucius Rufus Bruttium and to Lucius Furius Purpureo Gaul At the first meeting of the people the proposal concerning the Macedonian war was rejected by al most all the tribes This was occasioned partly by the people s own inclinations who wearied by the length and severity of the late war longed to be freed from toils and dangers and partly by Quintus B ebius tri bune of the people who pursuing the old practice of criminating the patricians charged them with multi plying wars one after another so that the people could never enjoy peace This proceeding gave great offence to the patricians and the tribune was severely repre hended in the senate where all earnestly recommended it to the consul to call a new assembly for passing the proposal to rebuke the backwardness of the people and to prove to them how highly detrimental and dis honorable it would be to decline engaging in that war 7 The consul having assembled the people in the 206 LIVY field of Mars before he called on the centuries to give their votes required their attention and addressed them thus â Citizens you seem to me not to under stand that the question before you is not whether you choose to have peace or war for Philip having al ready commenced hostilities wilh a formidable force both on land and sea allows you not that option The question is whether you choose to transport your le gions to Macedonia or to suffer the enemy to come into Italy How important the difference is between these two cases if you knew it not before you have sufficiently learned in the late Punic war for who en tertains a doubt but if wben the Saguntines were be sieged and implored our protection we had assisted them with vigor as our fathers did the Mamertines we should have averted the whole weight of the war on Spain which by our dilatory proceedings we suf fered to our extreme loss to fall on Italy Nor does it admit a doubt that what confined this same Philip in Macedonia after he had entered into an engage ment with Hannibal by ambassadors and letters to cross over into Italy was our sending Laevinus with a fleet to carry the war home to him And what we did at that time when we had Hannibal to contend with in Italy do we hesitate to do now after Hannibal has been expelled Italy and the Carthaginians sub dued Suppose for an instant that we allow the king to experience the same inactivity on our part while he is taking Athens as Hannibal found while he was taking Saguntum it will not be in the fifth month as the Carthaginian came from Saguntum but on the fifth day after the Macedonian sets sail from Corinth that he will arrive in Italy Perhaps you may not consider Philip as equal to Hannibal or the Macedo nians to the Carthaginians certainly however you will allow him equal to Pyrrhus Equal do I say what a vast superiority has the one man over the otherâ the one nation over the other Epirus ever was and is at this day deemed but an inconsiderable accession to the kingdom of Macedonia Philip lias HISTORY OF ROME BOOK XXXI 297 the intire Peloponnesus under Lis dominion even Ar gos itself not more celebrated for its ancient glory than for the death of Pyrrhus Now compare our situation How much more florishing was Italy when Pyrrhus attacked it How much greater its strength possessing so many commanders so many armies which the Punic war afterwards consumed Yet was he able to give it a violent shock and advanced victorious al most to the gates of Rome and not the Tarentines only and the inhabitants of that tract of Italy which they call the greater Greece whom you may suppose to have been led by the similarity of language and name but the Lucanian the Bruttian and the Sam nite revolted from us Do you believe that these would continue quiet and faithful if Philip should come over to Italy because they continued faithful afterwards and during the Punic war Be assured those states will never fail to revolt from us except when there is no one to whom they can go over If you had disapproved of a Roman army passing into Africa you would this day have had Hannibal and the Carthaginians to contend with in Italy Let Macedo nia rather than Italy be the seat of war Let the cities and lands of the enemy be wasted with fire and sword We have already found by experience that our arms are more powerful and more successful abroad than at home Go and give your voices with the blessing of the gods and what the senate have voted do you ratify by your order This resolution is recommended to you not only by your consul but even by the immortal gods themselves who when I offered sacrifice and prayed that the issue of this war might be happy and prosperous to me and to the se nate to you and the allies and Latine confederates granted every omen of success and happiness 8 After this speech of Sulpicius being sent to give their votes they declared for the war as he had pro posed On which in pursuance of a decree of the se nate a supplication for three days was proclaimed by the consuls and prayers were offered to the gods at 298 LIVY all the shrines that the war which the people had or dered against Philip might be attended with success and prosperity The consul Sulpicius inquiring of the heralds whether they would direct the declaration of the war against king Philip to be made to himself in person or whether it would be sufficient to publish it in the nearest garrison within the frontiers of his king dom they answered that either would do The consul received authority from the seuate to send any person whom he thought proper not being a senator as am bassador to denounce war against the king They then proceeded to arrange the armies for the consuls and pretors The consuls were ordered to levy two legions and to disband the veteran troops Sulpicius to whom the management of this new and highly im portant war had been decreed was allowed permission to carry with him as many volunteers as he could pro cure out of the army which Publius Scipio had brought home from Africa but he was not empowered to com pel any veteran soldier to attend him They ordered that the consul should give to the pretors Lucius Fu rius Purpureo and Quintus Minucius Rufus five thou sand of the allies of the Latine confederacy with which forces they should hold one the province of Gaul the other Bruttium Quintus Fulvius Gillo was ordered in like manner to select out of the army which Pub lius tEHus late consul had commanded such as had been the shortest time in the service until he also made up five thousand of the allies and Latine confe derates for guarding his province of Sicily To Mar cus Valerius Falto who during the former year had held the province of Campania as pretor the command was continued for a year in order that he might go over in quality of propretor to Sardinia and choose out of the army there five thousand of the allies of the Latine confederacy who also had been the shortest time in the service The consuls were at the same time ordered to levy two legions for the city which might be sent wherever occasion should require as there were many states in Italy infected with an at HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXXI 299 tachment to the Carthaginians which they had formed during the war and in consequence swelling with re sentment The state was to employ during that year six Roman legions 9 In the midst of the preparations for war ambassa dors came from king Ptolemy with the following mes sage â that the Athenians had petitioned the king for aid against Philip but that although they were their common allies yet the king would not without the direction of the Roman people send either fleet or army into Greece for the purpose of defending or at tacking any person that he would remain quiet in his kingdom if the Romans were at leisure to protect their allies or if more agreeable to them to be at rest would himself send such aid as should effectually se cure Athens against Philip Thanks were returned to the king by the senate and this answer â that  it was the intention of the Roman people to protect their allies that if they should have occasion for any assist ance towards carrying on the war they would acquaint the king and that they were fully sensible that in the power of his kingdom their state had a sure and faith ful resource Presents were then by order of the senate sent to the ambassadors of five thousand asses i to each While the consuls were employed in levying troops and making other necessary preparations the people prone to religious observances especially at the beginning of new wars after supplications had been already performed and prayers offered up at all the shrines lest any thing should be omitted that had ever been practised ordered that the consul who was to have the province of Macedonia should vow games and a present to Jove Licinius the chief pontiff oc casioned some delay in the performance of it alleging that  he could not properly frame the vow unless the money to discharge it were specified for as the sum to be named could not be applied to the uses of the war it should be immediately set apart and not to be  16 2s Id 300 LIVY intermixed with other money and that unless this were done the vow could not be fulfilled Although the objection and the person who proposed it were both of weight yet the consul was ordered to consult the college of pontiffs whether a vow could not be un dertaken without specifying the amount to discharge it The pontiffs determined that it could and that it would be even more in order to do it in that way The consul therefore repeating after the chief pontiff made the vow in the same words in which those made for five years of safety used to be expressed only that he engaged to perform the games and make the offer ings at such expense as the senate should direct by their vote at the time when the vow was to be put in act Before this the great games so often vowed were constantly rated at a certain expense this was the first time that the sum was not specified 10 While every one s attention was turned to the Macedonian war and at a time when people appre hended nothing less a sudden account was brought of an inroad made by the Gauls The Insubrians Caeno manians and Boians having been joined by the Saly ans Ilvatians and other Ligurian states and putting themselves under the command of Hamilcar a Cartha ginian who having been in the army of Hasdrubal had remained in those parts had fallen on Placentia and after plundering the city and in their rage burn ing a great part of it leaving scarcely two thousand men among the flames and ruins passed the Po and advanced to plunder Cremona The news of the cala mity which had fallen on a city in their neighborhood having reached thither the inhabitants had time to shut their gates and place guards on the walls that they might at least try the event of a siege and send messengers to the Roman pretor Lucius Furius Pur pureo who had then the command of the province Lad in pursuance of the decree of the senate dis banded the army excepting five thousand of the allies and Latine confederates and had halted with these troops in the nearest district of the province about HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXXI 301 Ariminuni He immediately informed the senate by letter of the subsisting tumult that of the two co lonies which had escaped the general wreck in the dreadful storm of the Punic war one was taken and sacked by the present enemy and the other besieged Nor was his army capable of affording sufficient pro tection to the distressed colonists unless he chose to expose five thousand allies to be slaughtered by forty thousand invaders for so many there were in arms and by such a loss on his side to augment their cou rage already elated on having destroyed one Roman colony 11 On reading this letter it was decreed that the consul Aurelius should order the army which he had appointed to assemble on a certain day in Etruria to attend him on the same day at Ariminum and should either go in person if the public business would per mit to suppress the tumult of the Gauls or write to the pretor Lucius Furius that as soon as the legions from Etruria came to him he should send five thou sand of the allies to guard that place in the mean time and should himself proceed to relieve the colony from the siege It was also decreed that ambassadors should be sent to Carthage and also into Numidia to Masi nissa to Carthage to tell that people that  their coun tryman Hamilcar having been left in Gaul either with a part of the army formerly commanded by Has drubal or with that of Magoâ they did not with cer tainty know which was waging war contrary to the treaty that he had raised forces from among the Gauls and Ligurians and persuaded them to take arms against Rome that if they ehose a continuance of peace they must recall him and give him up to the Roman peo ple They were ordered at the same time to tell them that all the deserters had not been produced that a great part of them were said to appear openly in Car thage who ought to be sought after and surrendered according to the treaty This was the message they were to deliver to the Carthaginians To Masinissa they were charged with congratulations on his  having 303 LIVY not only recovered the kingdom of his father but en larged it by the acquisition of the most florishing parts of Syphax s territories They were ordered also to acquaint him that the Romans had entered into a war against Philip because he had given aid to the Carthaginians while by the injuries which he ofFered to the allies of the Roman people he had obliged them to send fleets and armies into Greece at a time when the flames of war spread over all Italy and that by thus making them separate their forces had been the principal cause of their beirfg so late in passing over to Africa and to request him to send some Numidian horsemen to assist in that war Ample presents were given them to be carried to the king vases of gold and silver a purple robe and a tunic adorned with palms of purple an ivory sceptre and a robe of state with a curule chair They were also directed to as sure him that if he deemed any thing farther requisite to confirm and enlarge his kingdom the Roman peo ple in return for his good services would exert their utmost zeal to effect it At this time too the senate was addressed by ambassadors from Vermina son of Syphax apologising for his mistaken conduct on ac count of his youth and want of judgment and throwing all the blame on the deceitful policy of the Carthagi nians adding that as Masinissa had from an enemy become a friend to the Romans so Vermina would also use his best endeavors that he should not be out done in offices of friendship to the Roman people either by Masinissa or by any other and requesting that he might receive from the senate the title of king friend and ally The answer given to these ambassadors was that not only his father Syphax from a friend and ally had on a sudden without any reason become an enemy to the Roman people but that he himself had made his first essay of manhood in bearing arms against them He must therefore sue to the Roman people for peace before he could expect to be acknow leged king ally and friend that it was the practice of that people to bestow the honor of such title in re HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXXI 303 turn for great services performed by kings towards them that the Roman ambassadors would soon be in Africa to whom the senate would give instructions to regulate conditions of peace with Vermina as he should submit the terms intirely to the will of the Roman people and that if he wished that any thing should be added left out or altered he must make a second application to the senate The ambassadors sent to Africa on those affairs were Caius Terentius Varro Publius Lucretius and Cneius Octavius each of whom had a quinquereme assigned him 12 A letter was then read in the senate from Quin tus Minucius the pretor who held the province of Bruttium that the money had been privately carried off by night out of the treasury of Proserpine at Locri and that there were no traces which could direct to the discovery of the guilty persons The senate was highly incensed at finding that the practice of sacrilege continued and that even the fate of Pleminius an example so recent and so conspicuous both of the guilt and of the punishment did not deter from it They ordered the consul Cneius Aurelius to signify to the pretor in Bruttium that it was the pleasure of the senate that an inquiry be made concerning the robbery of the treasury according to the method used by Mar cus Pomponius pretor three years before that the money which could be discovered should be restored and any deficiency be made up  and that if he thought proper atonements should be made for the purpose of expiating the violation of the temple in the manner formerly prescribed by the pontiffs At the same time also accounts were brought of many prodigies happen ing in several places It was said that in Lucania the sky had been seen in a blaze that at Privernum in clear weather the sun had been of a red color during a whole day that at Lanuvium in the temple of Juno Sospita a very loud bustling noise had been heard in the night Besides monstrous births of animals were related to have occurred in many places in the coun try of the Sabines an infant was born whose sex could 304 LIVY not be distinguished and another was found sixteen years old whose sex also was doubtful At Frusino a lamb was born with a swine s head at Sinuessa a pig with a human head and in Lucania in the land be longing to the state a foal with five feet All these were considered as horrid and abominable and as if Nature were straying from her course in confounding the different species Above all the people were par ticularly shocked at the hermaphrodites which were ordered to be immediately thrown into the sea as had been lately done with a production of the same mon strous kind in the consulate of Caius Claudius and Marcus Livius Not satisfied with this they ordered the decemvirs to inspect the books in regard of that prodigy and the decemvirs from the books directed the same religious ceremonies which had been per formed on an occasion of the same kind They or dered besides a hymn to be sung through the city by thrice nine virgins and an offering to be made to im perial Juno The consul Caius Aurelius took care that all these matters were performed according to the direction of the decemvirs The hymn was composed by Publius Licinius Tegula as a similar one had been in the memory of their fathers by Livius 13 All religious scruples were fully removed by expiations at Locri too the affair of the sacrilege had been thoroughly investigated by Quintus Minu cius and the money replaced in the treasury out of the effects of the guilty When the consuls wished to set out to their provinces a number of private persons to whom the third payment became due that year of the money which they had lent to the public in the consu late of Marcus Valerius and Marcus Claudius applied to the senate The consuls however having declared that the treasury being scarcely sufficient for the exi gences of a new war in which a great fleet and great armies must be employed there were no means of paying them at present The senate could not avoid being affected by their complaints in which they al leged that if the state intended to use for the pur HISTORY OF ROME BOOK XXXI 305 pose of the Macedonian war the money which had been lent for the Punic war as one war constantly arose after another what would be the issue but that in return for their kind assistance to the public their property would be confiscated as if they had been guilty of some crime V The demands of the private creditors being equitable and the state being in no capacity of discharging the debt they determined to pursue a middle course between equity and conveni ence and accordingly they decreed that whereas many of them mentioned that lands were frequently exposed to sale and that they themselves wished to become purchasers they should therefore have liberty to purchase any belonging to the public and which lay within fifty miles of the city That the consuls should make a valuation of these and impose on each acre a quit rent of one as as an acknowlegement that the land was the property of the public in order that when the people should become able to pay if any one chose rather to have the money than the land he might re store it The private creditors accepted the terms with joy and that land was called Trientius and Ta bulius because it was given in lieu of the third part of their money 14 Publius Sulpicius after making his vows in the capitol set out from the city in his robes of war at tended by his lictors and arrived at Brundusium where having formed into legions the veteran soldiers of the African army who were willing to follow him and chosen his number of ships out of the fleet of the late consul Cornelius he set sail and next day ar rived in Macedonia There he was met by ambassa dors from the Athenians intreating him to relieve their city from the siege Immediately Caius Clau dius Centho was despatched to Athens with twenty ships of war and a small body of land forces for it was not the king himself who carried on the siege of Athens he was at that time intently occupied in be sieging Abydus after having tried his strength at sea against Attalus and against the Rhodians without liv vol v v 306 LIVY meeting success in either engagement But besides the natural presumptuousness of his temper he ac quired confidence from a treaty which he had formed with Antiochus king of Syria in which they had di vided the wealth of Egypt between them an object which on hearing of the death of Ptolemy they were both eager to secure As to the Athenians they had entangled themselves in a war with Philip on too tri fling an occasion and at a time when they retained nothing of their ancient dignity but pride During the celebration of the mysteries two young men of Acarnania who were not initiated unapprised of its being an offence against religion entered the temple of Ceres along with the rest of the crowd their dis course quickly betrayed them by their asking ques tions which discovered their ignorance whereon be ing carried before the presidents of the temple although it was evident that they went in through mistake yet they were put to death as if for a heinous crime The Acarnanian nation made complaint to Philip of this barbarous and hostile act and prevailed on him to grant them some aid of Macedonian soldiers and to allow hem to make war on the Athenians At first this army after ravaging the lands of Attica with fire and sword retired to Acarnania with booty of all kinds This was the first provocation to hostilities The Athenians afterwards on their side entered into a regular war and proclaimed it by order of the state for king Attalus and the Rhodians having come to JEgina in pursuit of Philip who was retiring to Mace donia the king crossed over to Piraeus for the purpose of renewing and strengthening the alliance between him and the Athenians On entering the city he was received by the whole inhabitants who poured forth with their wives and children to meet him by the priests with their emblems of religion and in a man ner by the gods themselves called forth from their abodes 15 Immediately the people were summoned to an assembly that the king might treat with them in per son on such subjects as he chose but afterwards it HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXXI 307 was judged more suitable to his dignity to explain his sentiments in writing than being present to be forced to blush either at the recital of his extraordinary fa vors to the state or at the immoderate applause of the multitude which would overwhelm his modesty with acclamations and other signs of approbation In the letter which he sent and which was read to the assem bly was contained first a recapitulation of the seve ral acts of kindness which he had shown to the Athe nian state as his ally then of the actions which he had performed against Philip and lastly an exhorta tion to enter immediately on the war while they had him Attalus the Rhodians and the Romans also to assist them not omitting to warn them that if they were backward now they would hereafter wish in vain for the opportunity which they neglected They then gave audience to the ambassadors of the Rhodians to whom they were under a recent obligation for having retaken and sent home four of their ships of War which had been lately seized by the Macedonians War was determined on against Philip with universal consent Unbounded honors were conferred on king Attalus and then on the Rhodians At that time men tion was made of adding a tribe which they were to call Attalis to the ten ancient tribes the Rhodian state was presented with a golden crown as an ac knowlegement of its bravery and the inhabitants with the freedom of Athens in like manner as Rhodes had formerly honored that people After this king Atta lus returned to jEgina where his fleet lay From jEgina the Rhodians sailed to Cia and thence to Rhodes steering their course among the islands all of which they brought to join in the alliance except Andros Paros and Cythnus which were held by Ma cedonian garrisons Attalus having sent messengers to jEtolia and expecting ambassadors from thence was detained at jEgina for some time in a state of in action failing also in his endeavors to excite the jEtolians to arms for they were rejoiced at having made peace with Macedon on any terms Had Attains 308 LIVY and the Rhodians pressed Philip vigorously they might have acquired the illustrious title of the deliverers of Greece hut by suffering him to pass over again into Hellespontus and to strengthen himself by seizing the advantageous posts in Greece they increased the diffi culties of the war and yielded up to the Romans the glory of having conducted and finished it 16 Philip acted with a spirit more becoming a king for though he had found himself unequal to the forces of Attalus and the Rhodians yet he was not dismayed even by the prospect of an approaching war with the Romans Sending Philocles one of his generals with two thousand foot and two hundred horse to ravage the lands of the Athenians he gave the command of his fleet to Heraclides with orders to sail to Maronea and marched thither himself by land with two thousand foot lightly equipped and two hundred horse Maronea he took at the first as sault and afterwards with a good deal of trouble got possession of jEnus which was at last betrayed to him by Ganymede who commanded there for Pto lemy He then seized on other forts Cypselus Do riscos and Serrheus and advancing from thence to the Chersonesus received Elaeus and Alopeconnesus which were surrendered by the inhabitants Callipo lis also and Madytos were given up to him with se veral forts of but little consequence The people of Abydus shut their gates against him not suffering even his ambassadors to enter the place The siege of this city detained Philip a long time and it might have been relieved if Attalus and the Rhodians had acted with any vigor The king sent only three hun dred men for a garrison and the Rhodians one quadri reme from their fleet although it was lying idle at Tenedos and afterwards when the besieged could with difficulty hold out any longer Attalus going over in person did nothing more than show them some hope of relief being near giving not any real assist ance to these his allies either by land or sea 17 At first the people of Abydus by means of HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXXI 300 engines placed along the walls not only prevented the approaches by land but annoyed the enemy s ships in their station Afterwards a part of the wall being thrown down and the assailants having penetrated by mines to an inner wall which had been hastily raised to oppose their entrance the besieged sent ambassa dors to the king to treat of terms of capitulation They demanded permission to send away the Rhodian qua drireme with the crew and the troops of Attalus in the garrison and that they themselves might depart from the city each with one suit of apparel but Philip s answer afforded no hopes of accommodation unless they surrendered at discretion When this was reported by their ambassadors it so exasperated them rousing at the same time their indignation and despair that seized with the same kind of fury which had pos sessed the Saguntines they ordered all the matrons to be shut up in the temple of Diana and the free born youths and virgins and even the infants with their nurses in the place of exercise the gold and silver to be carried into the forum their valuable garments to be put on board the Rhodian ship and another from Cyzicum which lay in the harbor the priests and victims to be brought and altars to be erected in the midst There they appointed a select number who as soon as they should see the army of their friends cut off in defending the breach were in stantly to slay their wives and children to throw into the sea the gold silver and apparel that was on board the ships and to set fire to the buildings public and private and to the performance of this deed they were bound by an oath the priests repeating before them the verses of execration Those who were of an age capable of fighting then swore to continue the battle till they fell unless victorious These regard ful of the gods by whom they had sworn maintained their ground with such obstinacy that although the night would soon have put a stop to the fight yet the king terrified by their fury first drew off his forces The chief inhabitants to whom the more shocking 310 LI VY part of the plan had been given in charge seeing that few survived the battle and that these were exhausted by fatigue and wounds sent the priests having their heads bound with the fillets of suppliants at the dawn of the next day to surrender the city to Philip 18 Before the surrender one of the Roman ambas sadors who had been sent to Alexandria Marcus jEmilius being the youngest of them in pursuance of a resolution which the three had jointly formed on hearing of the present siege came to Philip and com plained of his having made war on Attalus and the Rhodians and particularly of the attack on Abydus in which he was then employed and on Philip s say ing that he had been forced into the war by Attalus and the Rhodians commencing hostilities against him â Did the people of Abydus too said he  com mence hostilities against you To him who was unaccustomed to hear truth this language seemed too arrogant to be used to a king and he answered â Your youth the beauty of your form and above all the name of Roman render you too presumptuous However my first desire is that you would observe the treaties and continue in peace with me but if you begin an attack I am on my part determined to prove that the kingdom and name of the Macedonians is not less formidable in war than that of the Romans Having dismissed the ambassadors in this manner Philip got possession of the gold and silver which had been thrown together in a heap but was disappointed of his booty with respect to prisoners for such vio lent frensy had seized the multitude that on a sud den taking up a persuasion that they were guilty of treachery towards those who had fallen in the battle and upbraiding one another with perjury especially the priests who would surrender alive to the enemy those persons whom they themselves had devoted they all at once ran different ways to put their wives and children to death and then they put an end to their own lives by every possible method The king asto nished at their madness restrained the violence of his HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXXI 311 soldiers and said that he would allow the people of Abydus three days to die in and during this space the vanquished perpetrated more deeds of cruelty on themselves than the enraged conquerors would have committed nor did any one of them come into the enemy s hands alive except such as were in chains or under some other insuperable restraint Philip leav ing a garrison in Abydus returned to his kingdom and just when he had been encouraged by the de struction of the people of Ahydus to proceed in the war against Rome as Hannibal had been by the de struction of Saguntum he was met by couriers with intelligence that the consul was already in Epirus and had drawn his land forces to Apollonia and his fleet to Corcyra into winter quarters 19 In the mean time the ambassadors who had been sent into Africa on the affair of Hamilcar the leader of the Gallic army received from the Carthaginians this answer that  it was not in their power to do more than to inflict on him the punishment of exile and to confiscate his effects that they had delivered up all the deserters and fugitives whom on a diligent inquiry they had been able to discover and would send ambassadors to Rome to satisfy the senate on that head They sent two hundred thousand measures of wheat to Rome and the same quantity to the army in Macedonia From thence the ambassadors pro ceeded into Numidia to the kings delivered to Ma sinissa the presents and the message according to their instructions and out of two thousand Numidian horse men which he offered accepted one thousand Masi nissa superintended in person the embarkation of these and sent them with two hundred thousand mea sures of wheat and the same quantity of barley into Macedonia The third commission which they had to execute was with Vermina He advanced to meet them as far as the utmost limits of his kingdom and left it to themselves to prescribe such conditions of peace as they thought proper declaring that he should consider any peace with the Roman people as 312 LIVY just and advantageous The terms were then settled and he was ordered to send ambassadors to Rome to procure a ratification of the treaty 20 About the same time Lucius Cornelius Lentu lus proconsul came home from Spain and having laid before the senate an account of his brave and suc cessful conduct during the course of many years de manded that he might be allowed to enter the city in triumph The senate on this gave their opinion that his services were indeed deserving of a triumph but that they had no precedent left them by their an cestors of any person enjoying a triumph who was not at the time of performing the service on account of which he claimed that honor either dictator con sul or pretor that he had held the province of Spain in quality of proconsul and not of consul or pretor They determined however that he might enter the city in ovation Against this Tiberius Sempronius Lon gus tribune of the people protested alleging that such proceedings would be no less unprecedented and contrary to the practice of their ancestors than the other but overcome at length by the unanimous de sire of the senate the tribune withdrew his opposition and Lucius Lentulus entered the city in ovation He carried to the treasury forty four thousand pounds weight of silver and two thousand four hundred pounds weight of gold To each of the soldiers he distributed of the spoil one hundred and twenty asses i 21 The consular army had by this time removed from Arretium to Ariminum and the five thousand Latine confederates had gone from Gaul into Etruria Lucius Furius therefore advanced from Ariminum by forced marches against the Gauls who were then be sieging Cremona and pitched his camp at the distance of one mile and a half from the enemy Furius had an excellent opportunity of striking an important blow had he without halting led his troops directly to attack their camp they were scattered and dispersed through i 7s 9d HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXXI 313 the country and the guard which they had left was very insufficient but he was apprehensive that his men were too much fatigued by their hasty march The Gauls recalled from the fields by the shouts of their party returned to the camp without seizing the booty within their reach and next day marched out to offer battle the Roman did not decline the combat but had scarcely time to make the necessary dispositions so rapidly did the enemy advance to the fight The right brigade for he had the troops of the allies divided into brigades was placed in the first line the two Ro man legions in reserve Marcus Furius was at the head of the right brigade Marcus Caecilius of the le gions and Lucius Valerius Flaccus of the cavalry these were all lieutenants general Two other lieute nants general Cneius Laetorius and Publius Titinnius the pretor kept near himself that with their assistance he might observe and take proper measures against any sudden attack At first the Gauls bending their whole force to one point were in hopes of being able to overwhelm and trample under foot the right brigade which was in the van but not succeeding they en deavored to turn round the flanks and to surround their enemy s line which considering the multitude of their forces and the small number of the others seemed easy to be done On observing this the pre tor in order to extend his own line brought up the two legions from the reserve and placed them on the right and left of the brigade which was engaged in the van vowing a temple to J upiter if he should on that day prove victorious To Lucius Valerius he gave orders to make the horsemen of the two legions on one flank and the cavalry of the allies on the other charge the wings of the enemy and not suffer them to come round to his rear At the same time observing that the centre of their line was weakened from having extended the wings be directed his men to make an attack there in close order and to break through their ranks The wings were routed by the cavalry and at the same time the centre by the foot Being worsted in all 314 LIVY parts with great slaughter the Gauls quickly turned their backs and fled to their camp in hurry and con fusion The cavalry pursued them and the legions coming up in a short time after assaulted the camp from whence there did not escape so many as six thousand men There were slain and taken above thirty five thousand with eighty standards and above two hundred Gallic waggons laden with booty of all kinds Hamilcar the Carthaginian general fell that day and three distinguished generals of the Gauls The prisoners taken at Placentia to the number of two thousand free men were restored to the colony 22 This was an important victory and caused great joy at Rome On receipt of the pretor s letter a sup plication for three days was decreed In that battle there fell of the Romans and allies two thousand most of them in the right brigade against which in the first onset the most violent efforts of the enemy had been directed Although the pretor had brought the war almost to a conclusion yet the consul Cneius Aure lius having finished the business which required his attendance at Rome set out for Gaul and received the victorious army from the pretor The other con sul arriving in his province towards the end of autumn passed the winter in the neighborhood of Apollonia Caius Claudius and the Roman triremes which had been sent to Athens from the fleet that was laid up at Corcyra as was mentioned above arriving at Piraeus greatly revived the hopes of their allies who were be ginning to give way to despair Their arrival not only put a stop to the inroads by land which used to be made from Corinth through Megara but so terrified the pirates from Chalcis who had been accustomed to infest both the Athenian sea and coast that they dared not venture round the promontory of Sunium nor even trust themselves out of the straits of the Euripus In addition to these came three quadriremes from Rhodes the Athenians having three open ships which they had equipped for the protection of their lands on the coast While Claudius thought that if he were able with his HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXXI 315 fleet to give security to the Athenians it was as much as could be expected at present Fortune threw in his way an opportunity of accomplishing an enterprise of greater moment 23 Some exiles driven from Chalcis by ill treat ment received from the king s party brought intelli gence that the place might be taken without even a contest for the Macedonians being under no imme diate apprehension from an enemy were straying idly about the country and the townsmen depending on the Macedonian garrison neglected the guard of the city Claudius in consequence of this set out and though he arrived at Sunium early enough to have sailed forward to the entrance of the strait of Euboea yet fearing that on doubling the promontory he might be descried by the enemy he lay by with the fleet until night As soon as it grew dark he began to move and favored by a calm arrived at Chalcis a little before day and then approaching the city on a side where it was thinly inhabited with a small party of soldiers and by means of scaling ladders he got pos session of the nearest tower and the wall on each side Finding in some places the guards asleep and other parts left without any watch they advanced to the more populous parts of the town and having slain the sentinels and broke open a gate they gave an entrance to the main body of the troops These im mediately spread themselves through all parts of the city and increased the tumult by setting fire to the buildings round the forum by which means both the granaries belonging to the king and his armory with a vast store of machines and engines were reduced to ashes Then commenced a general slaughter of those who fled as well as of those who made resistance and after having either put to the sword or driven out every one who was of an age fit to bear arms Sopater also the Acarnanian who commanded the garrison being slain they first collected all the spoils in the forum and then carried it on board the ships The prison too was forced open by the iihodians and those whom Philip 316 LIVY had shut up there were set at liberty They next pulled down and mutilated the statues of the king and then on a signal being given for a retreat reimbarked and returned to Piraus from whence they had set out If there had been a sufficient number of Roman soldiers to have kept possession of Chalcis without stripping Athens of a proper garrison that city and the com mand of the Euripus would have been a most important advantage at the commencement of the war for as the pass of Thermopylae is the principal barrier of Greece by land so is the strait of the Euripus by sea 24 Philip was then at Demetrias and as soon as the news arrived there of the calamity which had befallen the city of his allies although it was too late to carry assistance to those who were already ruined yet anxi ous to accomplish what was next to assistance revenge he set out instantly with five thousand foot lightly equipped and three hundred horse With a speed almost equal to that of racing he hastened to Chalcis not doubting but that he should be able to surprise the Romans Finding himself disappointed and that his coming answered no other end than to give him a melancholy view of the smoking ruins of that friendly city so few being left that they were scarcely suffi cient to bury those who had fallen by the sword of the enemy with the same rapid haste which he had used in coming he crossed the Euripus by the bridge and led his troops through Boeotia to Athens in hopes that a similar attempt might be attended by a similar issue and he would have succeeded had not a scout one of those whom the Greeks call day runners i because they run through a journey of great length in one day des crying from his post of observation the king s army in its march set out at midnight and arrived before them at Athens The same sleep and the same negligence prevailed there which had proved the ruin of Chalcis a few days before Roused however by the alarming intelligence the pretor of the Athenians and Dioxip Hemerodromoi HISTORY OF ROME 317 â BOOK XXXI pus commander of a cohort of mercenary auxiliaries called the soldiers together in the forum and ordered the trumpets to sound an alarm from the citadel that all might be informed of the approach of the enemy On which the people ran from all quarters to the gates and afterwards to the walls In a few hours after and still some time before day Philip approached the city and observing a great number of lights and hearing the noise of the men hurrying to and fro as usual on such an alarm he halted his troops and ordered them to sit down and take some rest resolving to use open force since his design of surprise had not succeeded Accordingly he advanced on the side of Dipylos or the double gate which being the principal entrance of the city is somewhat larger and wider than the rest Both within and without the streets are wide so that the townsmen could form their troops from the forum to the gate while on the outside a road of about a mile in length leading to the school of the academy afforded open room to the foot and horse of the enemy The Athenians who had formed their troops within the gate marched out with Attalus garrison and the cohort of Dioxippus along that road This Philip ob served and thinking that he had the enemy in his power and might now satisfy his revenge in their de struction and which he had long wished for being more incensed against them than any of the Grecian states he exhorted his men to keep their eyes on him during the fight and to take notice that wherever the king was there the standards and the army ought to be He then spurred on his horse animated not only with resentment but with a desire of gaining honor reckoning it a glorious opportunity of displaying his prowess in the view of an immense crowd which covered the walls many of them for the purpose of beholding the engagement Advancing far before the line and with a small body of horse rushing into the midst of the enemy he inspired his men with great ardor and the Athenians with terror Having wounded many with his own hand both in close fight and with LIVY missive weapons and driven them back within the gate he still pursued them closely and having made greater slaughter among them while embarrassed in the narrow pass rash as the attempt was he yet retired unmolested because those who were in the towers withheld their weapons lest they should hit their friends who were mingled in confusion among their enemies The Athenians after this confining their troops within the walls Philip sounded a retreat and pitched his camp at Cynosarges a temple of Hercules and a school surrounded by a grove But Cynosarges and Lycacum and whatever was sacred or pleasant in the neighborhood of the city he burned to the ground and levelled not only the houses but sepulchres pay ing no regard in the violence of his rage to any privi lege either of men or gods â 25 Next day the gates having at first been shut and afterwards suddenly thrown open in consequence of a body of Attalus troops from jEgina and the Romans from Piraeus having entered the city the king removed his camp to the distance of about three miles From thence he proceeded to Eleusis in hopes of surprising the temple and a fort which overlooks and surrounds it but finding that the guards were attentive and that the fleet was coming from Piraeus to support them he laid aside the design and led his troops first to Megara and then to Corinth where on hearing that the council of the Achaeans was then sitting at Argos he went and joined the assembly to the surprise of that people They were at the time employed in forming measures for a war against Na bis tyrant of the Lacedaemonians who observing on the command being transferred from Philopoemen to Cycliades a general much inferior to him that the confederates of the Achaeans were falling off had re newed the war and besides ravaging the territories of his neighbors was become formidable even to the cities While they were deliberating what number of men should be raised out of each of the states to op pose this enemy Philip promised that he would re HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXXI 319 Heve them from all anxiety as far as concerned Nabis and the Lacedasmonians and that he would not only secure the lands of their allies from devastation but transfer the whole terror of the war on Laconia itself by leading his army thither instantly This discourse being received with general approbation he added It is but reasonable however that while I am em ployed in protecting your property by my arms my own should not be exposed without defence there fore if you think proper provide such a number of troops as will be sufficient to secure Orcus Chalcis and Corinth that my affairs being in a state of safety behind me I may proceed without distraction to attack Nabis and the Lacedasmonians The Achaeans were not ignorant of the tendency of these kind pro mises and his offer of assistance against the Lacedae monians and that his view was to draw the Achaean youth out of Peloponnesus as hostages that he might have it in his power to embroil the nation in a war with the Romans Cycliades pretor thinking that it would answer no purpose to expose his scheme by argument said nothing more than that it was not allowable according to the laws of the Achaeans to take any matter into consideration except that on which they had been called together and the decree for levying an army against Nabis being passed he dismissed the assembly after having presided in it with much resolution and public spirit although until that day he had been reckoned a partizan of the king Philip grievously disappointed after having collected a few voluntary soldiers returned to Corinth and from thence into the territories of Athens 26 While Philip was in Achaia Philocles one of the generals marching from Euboea with two thousand Thracians and Macedonians intending to lay waste the territories of the Athenians crossed the forest of Cithaeron opposite to Eleusis Despatching half of his troops to make depredations in all parts of the coun try he lay concealed with the remainder in a place convenient for an ambush in order that if any attack 320 UVY should be made from the fort at Eleusis on his men employed in plundering he might suddenly fall on the enemy unawares and while they were in disorder His stratagem did not escape discovery wherefore calling back the soldiers who had gone different ways in pursuit of booty and drawing them up in order he advanced to assault the fort at Eleusis but being repulsed from thence with many wounds he joined Philip on his return from Achaia who was also in duced to a similar attempt but the Roman ships coming from Piraeus and a body of forces being thrown into the fort he was compelled to relinquish the design On this the king dividing bis army sent Philocles with one part to Athens and went himself with the other to Piraeus that while his general by advancing to the walls and threatening an assault should keep the Athenians within the city he might be able to make himself master of the harbor which he supposed would be left with only a slight garrison But he found the attack of Pirasus no less difficult than that of Eleusis the same persons acting in its defence He therefore hastily led his troops to Athens and being repulsed by a sudden sally of both foot and horse who engaged him in the narrow ground in closed by the half ruined wall which with two arms joins Piraeus to Athens he laid aside the scheme of attacking the city and dividing his forces again with Philocles set out to complete the devastation of the country As in his former ravages he had employed himself in levelling the sepulchres round the city so now not to leave any thing unviolated he ordered the temples of the gods of which they had one conse crated in every village to be demolished and burned The country of Attica afforded ample matter for the exercise of this barbarous rage for it was highly em bellished with works of that kind having plenty of marble and abounding with artists of exquisite inge nuity Nor was he satisfied with merely destroying the temples themselves and overthrowing the images but he ordered even the stones to be broken lest HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXXI 321 remaining whole they should give a degree of gran deur to the ruins and then his rage not being sa tiated but no object remaining on which it could be exercised he retired into Boeotia without having per formed in Greece any thing else worth mention 27 The consul Sulpicius who was at that time en camped on the river Apsus between Apollonia and Dyrrachium having ordered Lucius Apustius lieute nant general thither sent him with part of the forces to lay waste the enemy s country Apustius after ravaging the frontiers of Macedonia and having at the first assault taken the forts of Corragos Gerru nios and Orgessos came to Antipatria a city situated in a narrow vale where at first inviting the leading men to a conference he endeavored to prevail on them to put themselves under the protection of the Romans but finding that from confidence in the size fortifications and situation of their city they paid no regard to his discourse he attacked the place by force of arms and took it by assault then putting all the young men to the sword and giving up the intire spoil to his soldiers he rased the walls and burned the buildings This proceeding spread such terror that Codrion a strong and well fortified town sur rendered to the Romans without a struggle Leaving a garrison there he took Ilion by force a name better known than the town on account of that of the same deno mination in Asia As the lieutenant general was return ing to the consul with a great quantity of spoil Athe nagoras one of the king s generals falling on his rear in its passage over a river threw it into disorder On hearing the shouting and tumult Apustius rode back in full speed ordered the troops to face about and drew them up in order with the baggage in the centre The king s troops could not support the on set of the Roman soldiers so that many of them were slain and more made prisoners The lieutenant gene ral having brought back the army without loss to the consul was ordered to return immediately to the fleet liv vol v x 322 LIVY 28 The war commencing thus brilliantly with this successful expedition several petty kings and princes whose dominions bordered on Macedonia came to the Roman camp Pleuratus son of Scerdilsedus and Amy nander king of the Athamanians and from the Dar danians Bato son of Longarus This Longarus had in his own quarrel supported a war against Demetrius father of Philip To their offers of aid the consul answered that he would make use of the assistance of the Dardanians and of Pleuratus when he should lead his troops into Macedonia To Amynander he allotted the part of exciting the jEtolians to war To the am bassadors of Attalus for they also had come at the same time he gave directions that the king should wait at jEgina where he wintered for the arrival of the Roman fleet and when joined by that he should as before harass Philip by such enterprises as he could undertake by sea To the Rhodians also an embassy was sent to engage them to contribute their share towards carrying on the war Nor was Philip who had by this time arrived in Macedonia remiss in bis preparations for the campaign He sent his son Perseus then very young with part of his forces to block up the pass near Pelagonia appointing persons out of the number of his friends to attend him and direct his unexperienced age Sciathus and Pepare thus no inconsiderable cities he demolished fearing they might fall a prey to the enemy s fleet despatch ing at the same time ambassadors to the jEtolians lest that restless nation might change sides on the arrival of the Romans 29 The assembly of the jEtolians which they call Panaetolium was to meet on a certain day In order to be present at this the king s ambassadors hastened their journey and Lucius Furius Purpureo also ar rived being sent in like capacity by the consul Am bassadors from Athens likewise came to this assem bly The Macedonians were first heard as with them the latest treaty had been made and they declared HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXXI 323 that as no change of circumstances had occurred they had nothing new to introduce for the same rea sons which had induced the Etolians to make peace with Philip after experiencing the unprofitableness of an alliance with the Romans should engage them to preserve it now that it was established Do you rather choose said one of the ambassadors  to imi tate the inconsistency or levity shall I call it of the Romans who ordered this answer to be given to your ambassadors at Rome Why jEtolians do you ap ply to us when without our approbation you have made peace with Philip V Yet these same people now require that you should in conjunction witli them wage war against Philip Formerly too it was pretended that they took arms on your account and in your defence against Philip now they do not allow you to continue at peace with him To assist Messana they first embarked for Sicily and a second time to vindicate the liberty of Syracuse oppressed by the Carthaginians Both Messana and Syracuse and all Sicily they hold in their own possession and have reduced it into a tributary province under their axes and rods You imagine perhaps that in the same manner as you hold an assembly at Naupactus according to your own laws under magistrates of your own appointment at liberty to choose allies and enemies and to have peace or war at your own option so the assembly of the states of Sicily is summoned to Syracuse or Messana or Lilybaeum No a Roman pretor presides at the meeting at his command they assemble they behold him attended by bis lictors seated on a lofty throne issuing his haughty edicts His rods are ready for their backs his axes for their necks and every year they are allotted a different master Neither ought they nor can they wonder at this when they see all the cities of Italy bending under the same yoke â Rhegium Tarentum Capua not to mention those in their own neighborhood out of the ruins of which their city of Rome grew into power Capua indeed subsists the grave and monument of the 324 LIVY Campanian people who were either cut off or driven into banishment the mutilated carcass of a city without senate without commons without magis trates a sort of prodigy the leaving which to be in habited in this manner showed more cruelty than if it had been rased to the ground If foreigners who are separated from us to a greater distance by their lan guage manners and laws than by the length of sea and land are allowed to get footing here it is madness to hope that any thing will continue in its present state Does your liberty appear to be in any degree of danger from the government of Philip who at a time when he was justly incensed demanded nothing more of you than peace and at present requires no more than the observance of the peace which he agreed to Accustom foreign legions to these coun tries and receive the yoke too late and in vain will you look for an alliance with Philip when you will have become a property of the Romans Trifling causes occasionally unite and disunite the JEtolians Acarnanians and Macedonians men speaking the same language With foreigners with barbarians all Greeks have and ever will have eternal war be cause they are enemies by nature which is always the same and not from causes which change with the times I conclude my discourse with the same argu ment with which I began Three years since the same persons assembled in this same place deter mined on peace with the same Philip contrary to the inclinations of the same Romans who now wish that the peace should be broken after it has been ad justed and ratified In the subject of your delibera tion fortune has made no change why you should make any I do not see 30 Next after the Macedonians with the consent iind at the desire of the Romans the Athenians were introduced who having suffered grievously could with the greater justice inveigh against the cruelty and inhumanity of the king They represented in a de plorable light the miserable devastation and ruin of HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXXI 325 their country adding that  they did not complain on account of having from an enemy suffered hostile treatment for there were certain rights of war ac cording to which as it was just to act so it was just to endure Their crops being burned their houses demolished their men and cattle carried off as spoil were to be considered rather as misfortunes to the sufferer than as ill treatment But of this they had good reason to complain that he who called the Romans foreigners and barbarians had so atrociously violated himself all rights both divine and human as in his former inroad to have waged an impious war against the infernal gods in the latter against those above That every sepulchre and monument within their country was demolished the graves torn open and the bones left uncovered There had been seve ral temples which in former times when their an cestors dwelt in the country in their separate districts had been consecrated in each of their little forts and villages and which even after they were incorporated into one city they did not neglect or forsake Every one of these sacred edifices had Philip destroyed by fire and left the images of the gods lying scorched and mutilated among the prostrated pillars of the temples Such as he had rendered the country of Attica for merly opulent and adorned with improvements such if he were suffered would he render jEtolia and every part of Greece That Athens also would have been reduced to the same ruinous state if the Romans had not come to its relief for he had shown the same wicked rage against the gods who are the guardians of the city and Minerva who presides over the citadel the same against the temple of Ceres at Eleusis the same against Jupiter and Minerva at Pirasus In a word having been repelled by force of arms not only from their temples but even from their walls he had vented his fury on those sacred edifices which had no defence but in the respect due to reli gion They therefore intreated and besought the jEtolians that compassionating the Athenians and  following the guidance of the gods and under them 326 livy of the Romans who next to the gods possessed the greatest power they wpuld take part in the war 31 The Roman ambassador then addressed them to this purport The Macedonians first and afterwards the Athenians have obliged me to change intirely the method of my discourse for on the one hand the Macedonians by introducing charges against the Ro mans when I had come prepared to make complaint of the injuries committed by Philip against so many cities in alliance with us have obliged me to think of defence rather than accusation and on the other hand after the relation given by the Athenians of his inhuman and impious crimes against the gods both celestial and infernal what room is there left for me or any other to make any addition to the charge You are to suppose that the same complaints are made by the Cianians Abydenians JEneans Maronites Thasians Parians Samians Larissenians Messenians on the side of Achaia and complaints still heavier and more grievous by those whom he had it more in his power to injure for as to those proceedings which he censures in us if they are not found highly meri torious let them not be defended He has objected to us Rhegium and Capua and Syracuse As to Rhegium during the war with Pyrrhus a legion which at the earnest request of the Rhegians them selves we had sent thither as a garrison wickedly possessed themselves of the city which they had been sent to defend Did we then approve of that deed or did we exert the force of our arms against that guilty legion until we reduced them under our power and then after making them give satisfaction to the allies by their stripes and the loss of their heads re store to the Rhegians their city their lands and all their effects together with their liberty and laws To the Syracusans when oppressed and to add to the indignity by foreign tyrants we lent assistance and after enduring great fatigues in carrying on the siege of so strong a city both by land and sea for almost three years although the Syracusans them selves chose to continue in slavery to the tyrants HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXXI 327 rather than to trust to us yet becoming masters of the place and by exertion of the same force setting it at liberty we restored it to the inhabitants At the same time we do not deny that Sicily is our province and that the states which sided with the Carthaginians and in conjunction with them waged war against us pay us tribute and taxes on the contrary we wish that you and all nations should know that the condi tion of each is such as it has deserved at our hands and ought we to repent of the punishment inflicted on the Campanians of which even they themselves can not complain These men after we had on their ac count carried on war against the Samnites for near seventy years with great loss on our side had united them to ourselves first by treaty and then by inter marriages and the consequent affinities and lastly by admitting them to a participation of the rights of our state yet in the time of our adversity were the first of all the states of Italy which revolted to Han nibal after basely putting our garrison to death and afterwards through resentment at being besieged by us sent Hannibal to attack Rome If neither their city nor one man of them had been left remaining who could take offence or consider them as treated with more severity than they had deserved From con sciousness of guilt greater numbers of them perished by their own hands than by the punishments inflicted by us And while from the rest we took away the town and the lands still we left them a place to dwell in we suffered the city which partook not of the guilt to stand uninjured so that there is not visible this day any trace of its having been besieged or taken But why do I speak of Capua when even to van quished Carthage we granted peace and liberty The greatest danger is that by our too great readiness to pardon such we may encourage others to try the for tune of war against us Let so much suffice in our defence and against Philip whose domestic crimes whose parricides and murders of his relations and friends and whose lust more disgraceful to human 328 livy nature if possible than his cruelty you as being nearer to Macedonia are better acquainted with As to what concerns you jEtolians we entered into a war with Philip on your account you made peace with him without consulting us Perhaps you will say that while we were occupied in the Punic war you were constrained by fear to accept terms of pacification from him who possessed superior power and that on our side pressed by more urgent affairs we suspended our operations in a war which you had laid aside At present as we having by the favor of the gods brought the Punic war to a conclusion have fallen on Macedonia with the whole weight of our power so you have an opportunity offered you of regaining a place in our friendship and alliance unless you choose to perish with Philip rather than to conquer with the Romans 32 After this discourse of the ambassador the in clinations of all leaning towards the Romans Damo critus pretor of the jEtolians who it was reported had received money from the king without seeming to favor either party said that in consultations wherein the public safety was deeply interested no thing was so injurious as haste That repentance in deed generally followed and that quickly but yet too late and unavailing because designs carried on with precipitation could not be recalled nor matters brought back to their original state The time however for determining the point under consideration which for his part he thought should not be too early might yet immediately be fixed in this manner As it had been provided by the laws that no determination should be made concerning peace or war except in the Panae tolic or Pylaic councils let them immediately pass a decree that the pretor when he chooses to treat of either may have full authority to summon a council and that whatever shall be then debated and decreed shall be to all intents and purposes legal and valid as if it had been transacted in the Panaetolic or Pylaic assembly And thus dismissing the ambassadors HISTORY OF ROME BOOK XXXI 329 without coming to any resolution he said  that there in he acted most prudently for the interest of the state for the jEtolians would have it in their power to join in alliance with whichever of the parties should be more successful in the war Nothing farther was done in the assembly 33 Meanwhile Philip was making vigorous prepa rations for carrying on the war both by sea and land His naval forces he drew together at Demetrias in Thessaly supposing that Attalus and the Roman fleet would move from jEgina in the beginning of the spring He gave the command of the fleet and of the sea coast to Heraclides to whom he had formerly in trusted it The equipment of the land forces he took care of in person and thought that he had deprived the Romans of two powerful auxiliaries the jEtolians on the one side and the Dardanians on the other by making his son Perseus block up the pass at Pela gonia The consul was employed not in preparations but in the operations of war He led his army through the country of the Dassaretians leaving the corn un touched which he had brought from his winter quar ters for the fields afforded supplies sufficient for the consumption of the troops The towns and villages surrendered to him some through inclination others through fear some were taken by assault others were found deserted the barbarians flying to the neighboring mountains He fixed a standing camp at Lycus near the river Beous and from thence sent to bring in corn from the magazines of the Dassaretians Philip saw the whole country filled with consternation and not knowing the designs of the consul he sent a party of horse to discover his route Sulpicius was in the same state of uncertainty he knew that the king had moved from his winter quarters but in what di rection he had proceeded he knew not he also had sent horsemen to gain intelligence These two par ties having set out from opposite quarters after wan dering a long time among the Dassaretians through unknown roads fell at length into the same road 330 LIVY Neither doubted as soonas the noise of men and horses was heard at a distance that an enemy approached therefore before they came within sight of each other they got their arms in readiness and the moment they met both hastened eagerly to engage As they hap pened to be nearly equal in number and valor being picked men on both sides they fought during several hours with vigor until fatigue both of men and horses put an end to the fight without deciding the victory Of the Macedonians there fell forty horsemen of the Romans thirty five Still however neither party was able to carry back any certain information in what quarter the camp of his enemy lay But this was soon made known to them by deserters of whom either through restlessness or the prospect of reward a suffi cient number are found in every war to discover the affairs of the contending parties 34 Philip judging that it would tend considerably towards conciliating the affections of his men and in duce them to face danger more readily on his account if he bestowed some pains on the burial of the horse men who fell in that expedition ordered them to be conveyed into the camp in order that all might be spectators of the honors paid them at their funeral Nothing is so uncertain or so difficult to form a judgment of as the minds of the multitude The very measures which seem calculated to increase their alacrity in ex ertions of every sort often inspire them with fear and timidity Accordingly those who being always ac customed to fight with Greeks and Illyrians had only seen wounds made with javelins and arrows seldom even by lances came to behold bodies dismembered by the Spanish sword some with their arms lopped off or the neck intirely cut through heads severed from the trunk and the bowels laid open with other shock ing circumstances which the present warfare had wrought they therefore perceived with horror against what weapons and what men they were to fight Even the king himself was seized with appre hensions having never yet engaged the Romans in HISTORY OF ROME BOOK XXXI 331 a regular battle Wherefore recalling his son and the guard posted at the pass of Pelagonia in order to strengthen his army by the addition of those troops he thereby opened a passage into Macedonia for Pleura tus and the Dardanians Then taking deserters for guides he marched towards the enemy with twenty thousand foot and four thousand horse and at the distance of somewhat more than two hundred paces from the Roman camp and near Ithacus he fortified a hill with a trench and rampart From this place taking a view of the Roman station in the valley be neath he is said to have been struck with admiration both at the general appearance of the camp and the regular disposition of each particular part distin guished by the order of the tents and the intervals of the passages and to have declared that certainly that was not a camp of barbarians For two days the consul and the king each waiting for the other s mak ing some attempt kept their troops within the ram parts On the third day the Roman led out all his forces and offered battle 35 But the king not daring to risk so hastily a ge neral engagement sent four hundred Trallians who are a tribe of the Illyrians as we have said in another place and three hundred Cretans adding to this body of infantry an equal number of horse under the com mand of Athenagoras one of his nobles honored with the purple to make an attack on the enemy s cavalry When these troops arrived within a little more than five hundred paces the Romans sent out the light in fantry and two cohorts of horse that both cavalry and infantry might be equal in number to the Macedonians The king s troops expected that the method of fighting would be such as they had been accustomed to that the horsemen pursuing and retreating alternately would at one time use their weapons at another time turn their backs that the agility of the Illyrians would be serviceable for excursions and sudden attacks and that the Cretans might discharge their arrows as they advanced eagerly to the charge but this plan of fight 332 LIVY iug was intirely disconcerted by the manner in which the Romans made their onset which was not more brisk than it was obstinate for the light infantry as if in a general line of battle after discharging their ja velins carried on a close fight with their swords and the horsemen when they had once made a charge stopping their horses fought some on horseback while others dismounted and intermixed themselves with the foot By this means neither were the king s cavalry who were unaccustomed to a steady fight a match for the others nor were the infantry who were unac quainted with any other mode of fighting but that of skirmishing and irregular attacks and were besides but half covered with the kind of harness which they used at all equal to the Roman infantry who carried a sword and buckler and were furnished with proper armor both to defend themselves and to annoy the enemy nor did they sustain the combat but fled to their camp trusting intirely to their speed for safety 36 After an interval of one day the king resolving to make an attack with all his cavalry and light armed infantry had during the night placed in ambush in a convenient place between the two camps a body of targeteers whom they call peltastas and given orders to Athenagoras and the cavalry if they found they had the advantage in the open fight to pursue their suc cess if not that they should retreat leisurely and by that means draw on the enemy to the place where the ambush lay The cavalry accordingly did retreat but the officers of the body of targeteers by bringing for ward their men before the time and not waiting for the signal as they ought lost an opportunity of performing considerable service The Romans having gained the victory in open fight and also escaped the danger of the ambuscade retired to their camp Next day the consul marched out with all his forces and offered battle placing his elephants which had been taken in the Punic war in the front of the foremost battalions and which was the first time that the Romans made use of those creatures in the field Finding that the HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXXI 333 king kept himself quiet behind his intrenchments he advanced close up to them upbraiding him with cowardice and as notwithstanding he still declined an engagement the consul considering how dangerous foraging must be while the camps lay so near each other where the soldiers dispersed through the coun try were liable to be suddenly attacked by the horse removed his camp to a place called Octolophus distant about eight miles where he could forage with more safety While the Romans were collecting corn in the adjacent fields the king kept his men within the trenches in order to increase both the negligence and confidence of the enemy But when he saw them scattered he set out with all his cavalry and the auxiliary Cretans and marching with such speed that the swiftest footmen could by running but just keep up with the horse he took post between the camp of the Romans and their foragers Then dividing the forces he sent one part of them in quest of the ma rauders with orders to give no quarter with the other he himself halted and placed guards on the roads through which he supposed the enemy would fly back to their camp The slaughter and flight of the provi sioning party had continued for some time on all sides and no intelligence of the misfortune had yet reached the Roman camp because those who fled towards the camp fell in with the guards which the king had sta tioned to intercept them and greater numbers were slain by those who were placed in the roads than by those who had been sent out to attack them At length a few effected their escape through the midst of the enemy s posts but were so filled with terror that they excited a general consternation in the camp without being able to give any certain account of what was going on 37 The consul ordering the cavalry to carry aid to those who were in danger in the best manner they could drew out the legions from the camp and led them in order of battle towards the enemy The ca valry taking different ways through the fields missed 334 livy the road being deceived by the various shouts raised in several quarters Some of them met with the ene my and battles began in many places at once The hottest part of the action was at the station where the king commanded for the guard there was in numbers both of horse and foot almost a complete army and as they were posted on the middle road the greatest number of the Romans fell in with them The Mace donians had also the advantage in this that the king himself was present to encourage them and the Cre tan auxiliaries fighting in good order and in a state of preparation against troops disordered and irregular wounded many at a distance where no such danger was apprehended If they had acted with prudence in the pursuit they would have secured an advantage of great importance not only in regard to the glory of the present contest but to the general interest of the war but greedy of slaughter and following with too much eagerness they fell in with the advanced cohorts of the Romans under the military tribunes The horse men who were flying as soon as they saw the ensigns of their friends faced about against the enemy now in disorder so that in a moment s time the fortune of the battle was changed those now turning their backs who had lately been the pursuers Many were slain in close fight many in the pursuit nor was it by the sword alone that they perished several being driven into morasses were together with their horses swal lowed up in the deep mud The king himself was in danger for his horse falling in consequence of a wound threw him headlong to the ground and he very narrowly escaped being overpowered before he could recover his feet He owed his safety to a trooper who instantly leaped from his horse on which he mounted the affrighted king himself as he could not run so fast as to keep up with the horsemen was slain by the enemy who had collected about the place where Philip fell The king in his desperate flight rode about among the morasses some of which were easily passed and others not at length when most men HISTORY OF ROME BOOK XXXI 335 despaired of his ever returning he arrived in safety at his camp Two hundred Macedonian horsemen pe rished in that action about one hundred were taken eighty horses richly caparisoned were led off the field at the same time the spoils of arms were also carried off 38 Some have found fault with the king as guilty of rashness on that day and with the consul as not having pushed with spirit the advantage which he had gained for Philip they say on his part ought to have avoided coming to action knowing that in a few days the enemy having exhausted all the adjacent country must be reduced to the extremity of want and that the consul after having routed the Macedo nian cavalry and light infantry and nearly taken the king himself ought to have led on his troops directly to the enemy s camp where dismayed as they were they could have made no stand and that he might have finished the war in a moment s time This like most other matters was easier in speculation than in practice for if the king had brought his infantry into the engagement then indeed during the tumult and while vanquished and struck with dismay they fled from the field into their intrenchments and even con tinued their flight from thence on seeing the victorious enemy mounting the ramparts the king s camp might have fallen into the Romans possession But as the infantry had remained in the camp fresh and free from fatigue with outposts before the gates and guard properly disposed what would he have gained in hav ing imitated the rashness of which the king had just now been guilty by pursuing the routed horse On the other side the king s first plan of an attack on the foragers while dispersed through the fields was not injudicious could he have satisfied himself with a mo derate degree of success and it is the less surprising that he should have made a trial of fortune as there was a report that Pleuratus and the Dardanians had marched with very numerous forces and had already passed into Macedonia so that if he should be sur 33G LIVY rounded on all sides there was reason to think that the Roman might put an end to the war without stirring from his seat Philip however considered that after his cavalry had been defeated in two engagements he could with much less safety continue in the same post accordingly wishing to remove from thence and at the same time to keep the enemy in ignorance of his design he sent a herald to the consul a little before sunset to demand a truce for the purpose of burying the horsemen and thus imposing on him he began his march in silence about the second watch leaving a number of fires in all parts of his camp 39 The consul had already retired to take refresh ment when he was told that the herald had arrived and on what business he gave him no other answer than that he should be admitted to an audience early the next morning by which means Philip gained what he wanted the length of that night and part of the fol lowing day during which he might march his troops beyond the enemy s reach He directed his route towards the mountains a road which he knew the Ro mans with their heavy baggage would not attempt The consul having at the first light dismissed the he rald with a grant of a truce in a short time after dis covered that the enemy had gone off but not knowing what course to take in pursuit of them he remained in the same camp for several days which he employed in collecting forage He then marched to Stubera and brought thither from Pelagonia the corn that was in the fields From thence he advanced to Pellina not having yet discovered to what quarter the Macedonian had bent his course Philip having at first fixed his camp at Bryanium marched thence through cross roads and gave a sudden alarm to the enemy The Romans on this removed from Pellina and pitched their camp near the river Osphagus The king also sat down at a small distance forming his intrenchment on the bank of the river Erigonus Having there re ceived certain information that the Romans intended to proceed to Eordaea he marched away before them HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXXI 337 in order to take possession of the defiles and prevent the enemy from making their way where the roads are confined in narrow straits There with much labor he fortified some places with a rampart others with a trench others with stones heaped up instead of walls others with trees laid across according as the situation required or as materials lay convenient and thus a road in its own nature difficult he rendered as he imagined impregnable by the works which he drew across every pass The adjoining ground being mostly covered with woods was exceedingly incommodious to the phalanx of the Macedonians which is of no manner of use except when they extend their very long spears before their shields forming as it were a pallisade to perform which they require an open plain The Thra cians too were embarrassed by their lances which also are of a great length and were entangled among the branches that stood in their way on every side The body of Cretans alone was not unserviceable and yet even these though in case of an attack made on them they could to good purpose discharge their ar rows against the horses or riders where they were open to a wound yet against the Roman shields they could do nothing because they had neither strength sufficient to pierce through them nor was there any part exposed at which they could aim Perceiving therefore that kind of weapon to be useless they an noyed the enemy with stones which lay in plenty in all parts of the valley the strokes made by these on their shields with greater noise than injury for a short time retarded the advance of the Romans  but quickly learning to despise these weapons also some closing their shields in form of a tortoise forced their way through the enemy in front others having by a short circuit gained the summit of the hill dislodged the dismayed Macedonians from their guards and posts and even slew the greater part of them the difficulties of the ground preventing their escape 40 Thus with less opposition than they had ex pected to meet they passed the defiles and came to LIV VOL V Y 338 LIVY Eordaea then having laid waste the whole country the consul withdrew into Elimea From thence he made an irruption into Orestis and laid siege to the city Celetrum situated in a peninsula a lake sur rounds the walls and there is but one entrance from the main land along a narrow isthmus Relying on their situation the townsmen at first shut the gates and refused to submit but afterwards when they saw the troops in motion and advancing under cover of their closed shields and the isthmus covered by the enemy marching in their courage failed them and they surrendered without hazarding a struggle From Celetrum be advanced into the country of the Dassa retians took the city Pelium by storm carried off the slaves with the rest of the spoil and discharging the freemen without ransom restored the city to them after placing a strong garrison in it for it lay very conveniently for making inroads into Macedonia Hav ing thus carried devastation through the enemy s coun try the consul led back his forces into those parts which were already reduced to obedience near Apol lonia from whence at the beginning of the campaign he had set out to begin his operations Philip s atten tion had been drawn to other quarters by the JElo lians Athamanians and Dardanians so many were the wars that started up on different sides of him Against the Dardanians who were now retiring out of Macedonia he sent Athenagoras with the light infantry and the greater part of the cavalry and ordered him to hang on their rear as they retreated and by cut ting off their hindmost troops make them more cau tious for the future of leading out their armies from home As to the jEtolians Damocritus their pretor the same who at Naupactum had persuaded them to defer passing a decree concerning the war had in the next meeting roused them to arms after hearing of the battle between the cavalry at Octoloplms the irrup tion of the Dardanians and of Pleuratus with the Illy rians into Macedonia of the arrival of the Roman fleet too at Oreus and that Macedonia besides be HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXXI 339 ing beset on all sides by so many nations was in danger of being invested by sea also 41 These reasons had brought back Damocritus and the jEtolians to the interest of the Romans Marching out therefore in conjunction with Amynander king of the Athamanians they laid siege to Cercinium The inhabitants here had shut their gates whether of their own choice or by compulsion is unknown as they had a garrison of the king s troops However in a few days Cercinium was taken and burned  and after great  slaughter had been made those who survived both free men and slaves were carried off amongst other spoil This caused such terror as made all those who dwelt round the lake Boebius abandon their cities and fly to the mountains and the jEtolians not find ing booty turned away from thence and proceeded into Perrhaebia There they took Cyretias by storm and sacked it without mercy The inhabitants of Mal loea making a voluntary submission were received into alliance From Perrhaebia Amynander advised to march to Gomphi because that city lies close to Athamania and there was reason to think that it might be reduced without any great difficulty But the jEto lians for the sake of plunder directed their march to the rich plains of Thessaly Amynander following though he did not approve either of their careless method of carrying on their depredations or of their pitching their camp in any place where chance di rected without choice and without taking any care to fortify it Therefore lest their rashness and negli gence might be the cause of some misfortune to him self and his troops when he saw them forming their camp in low grounds under the city Phecadus he took possession with his own troops of an eminence about five hundred paces distant which could be ren dered secure by a slight fortification The jEtolians seemed to have forgotten that they were in an enemy s country excepting that they continued to plunder some straggling in small parties without arms others spending whole days and nights in drinking and sleep LIVY ing in the camp neglecting even to fix guards when Philip unexpectedly came on them His approach being announced by those who had fled out of the fields in a fright threw Damocritus and the rest of the officers into great confusion It happened to be mid day and when most of the men after a hearty meal lay fast asleep Their officers roused them however as fast as possible ordered them to take arms de spatched some to recall those who were straggling through the fields in search of plunder and so violent was their hurry that many of the horsemen went out without their swords and but few of them put on their corslets After marching out in this precipitate man ner the whole horse and foot not amounting to six hundred they met the king s cavalry superior in number in spirit and in arms They were therefore routed at the first charge and having scarcely at tempted resistance returned to the camp in shameful flight Several were slain and some taken having been cut off from the main body of the runaways 42 Philip when his troops had advanced almost to the rampart ordered a retreat to be sounded because both men and horses were fatigued not so much by the action as by the length of their march and the extraordinary celerity with which they had made it He therefore despatched the horsemen by troops and the companies of light infantry in turn for water after which they took refreshment The rest he kept on guard under arms waiting for the main body of the infantry which had marched with less expedition on account of the weight of their armor As soon as these arrived they also were ordered to fix their stan dards and laying down their arms before them to take food in haste sending two or at most three out of each company to provide water In the mean time the cavalry and light infantry stood in order and ready in case the enemy should make any motion The jEtolians as if resolved to defend their fortifica tions the multitude which had been scattered about the fields having by this time returned to the camp HISTORY OP ROME BOOK XXXI 341 posted bodies of armed men at the gates and on the rampart and from this safe situation looked with a degree of confidence on the enemy as long as they continued quiet But as soon as the troops of the Macedonians began to move and to advance to the rampart in order of battle and ready for an assault they all quickly abandoned their posts and fled through the opposite part of the camp to the eminence where the Athamanians were stationed During their flight in this confusion many of the jEtolians were slain and many made prisoners Philip doubted not that had there been daylight enough remaining he should have been able to make himself master of the camp of the Athamanians also but the day being spent in the fight and in plundering the camp afterwards he sat down under the eminence in the adjacent plain de termined to attack the enemy at the first dawn But the jEtolians under the same apprehensions which had made them desert their camp dispersed and fled during the following night Amynander was of the greatest service for by his directions the Athama nians who were acquainted with the roads conducted them into jEtolia whilst the Macedonians pursued them over the highest mountains through unknown paths In this disorderly flight a few missing their way fell into the hands of the Macedonian horsemen whom Philip at the first light on seeing the eminence abandoned had sent to infest them on their march 43 About the same time also Athenagoras one of the king s generals overtaking the Dardanians in their retreat homeward at first threw their rear into dis order but these unexpectedly facing about and form ing their line the fight became like a regular engage ment When the Dardanians began again to advance the Macedonian cavalry and light infantry harassed those who had no troops of that kind to aid them and were besides burdened with unwieldy arms The ground too favored the assailants very few were slain but many wounded none were taken because they rarely quit their ranks but both fight and retreat 342 livy in a close body Thus Philip having checked the proceedings of those two nations by these well timed expeditions gained reparation for the damages sus tained from the operations of the Romans the enter prise being as spirited as the issue was successful An accidental occurrence lessened the number of his enemies on the side of iEtolia Scopas a man of considerable influence in his own country having been sent from Alexandria by king Ptolemy with a great sum of gold hired and carried away to Egypt six thousand foot and some horse nor would he have suffered one of the young jEtolians to remain at home had not Damocritus it is not easy to say whether out of zeal for the good of the nation or out of oppo sition to Scopas for not having secured his interest by presents by sometimes reminding them of the war with which they were threatened at other times of the solitary state in which their country would be left detained some of them Such were the actions of the Romans and of Philip during that summer 44 In the beginning of the same summer the fleet under Lucius Apustius lieutenant general setting sail from Corcyra and passing by Malea formed a junc tion with king Attalus ofl Scyllaeum which lies in the district of Hermione The Athenian state which had for a long time through fear restrained their animo sity against Philip within some bounds assuming con fidence from the support now afforded them gave full scope to it without any reserve There are never wanting in that city orators who are ready on every occasion to inflame the people a kind of men who in all free states and more particularly in that of Athens where eloquence florishes in the highest de gree are maintained by the favor of the multitude These immediately proposed a decree and the com mons passed it that all the statues and images of Philip with their inscriptions and likewise those of all his ancestors of both sexes should be removed and defaced that the festival days solemnities and priests which had been instituted in honor of him or HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXXI 343 them should all be abolished and that even the ground where any such statue had been set up and inscribed with his name should be held abominable And it was resolved that for the future nothing which ought to be erected or dedicated in a place of purity should be there erected and that the public priests as often as they should pray for the people of Athens for their allies armies and fleets so often should they utter curses and execrations against Phi lip his offspring his kingdom his forces by sea and land and the whole race and name of the Macedo nians It was added to the decree that  if any per son in future should make any proposal tending to throw disgrace and ignominy on Philip the people of Athens would ratify it in its fullest extent if on the contrary any one should by word or deed endeavor to lessen his ignominy or to do him honor that who ever slew such person should be justified in so doing Lastly a clause was annexed that all the decrees formerly passed against the Pisistratidae should be in full force against Philip Thus the Athenians waged war against Philip with writings and with words in which alone their power consists 45 Attains and the Romans having from Her mione proceeded first to Piraeus and stayed there a few days after being loaded with decrees of the Athe nians in which the honors paid to their allies were as extravagant as the expressions of their resentment against their enemy had been sailed to Andres and coming to an anchor in the harbor called Gaureleos sent persons to sound the inclinations of the towns men whether they chose voluntarily to surrender rather than run the hazard of an assault On their answering that they were not at their own disposal the citadel being possessed by the king s troops At talus and the Roman lieutenant general landing their forces with every thing requisite for attacking towns made their approaches to the city on different sides The Roman engines and arms which they had never seen before together with the spirit of the soldiers so LIVY briskly approaching the walls were particularly terri fying to the Greeks insomuch that they immediately fled into the citadel leaving the city in the power of the enemy After holding out for two days in the citadel relying more on the strength of the place than on their arms on the third both they and the garrison capitulated on condition of their being transported to Delium in Boeotia and being each of them allowed a single suit of apparel The island was yielded up by the Romans to king Attalus the spoil and the orna ments of the city they themselves carried off Attalus desirous that the island of which he had got posses sion might not be quite deserted persuaded almost all the Macedonians and several of the Andrians to re main there and in some time after those who ac cording to the capitulation had been transported to Delium were induced to return from thence by the promises made them by the king in which they were disposed the more readily to confide by the ardent affection which they felt for their native country From Andros the combined army passed over to Cythnus there they spent several days to no purpose in at tempting to get possession of the city  when at length finding it scarcely worth the trouble they departed At Prasiae a place on the main land of Attica twenty barks of the Issrcans joined the Roman fleet These were sent to ravage the lands of the Carystians the rest of the fleet lying at Geraestus a noted harbor in Euboea until their return from Carystus on which setting sail together and steering their course through the open sea until they passed by Scyrus they arrived at the island of Icus Being detained there for a few days by a violent northerly wind as soon as it abated they passed over to Sciathus a city which had been lately plundered and desolated by Philip The sol diers spreading themselves over the country brought back to the ships corn and many other kinds of pro visions Plunder there was none nor had the Greeks deserved to be plundered Directing their course to Cassandrea they first came to Mendis a village on HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXXI 345 the coast of that state and intending from thence to double the promontory and bring round the fleet to the very walls of the city they were near being buried in the waves by a furious storm However after being dispersed and a great part of the ships having lost their rigging they escaped on shore This storm at sea was an omen of the kind of success which they were to meet on land for after collecting their ves sels together and landing their forces having made an assault on the city they were repulsed with con siderable loss there being a strong garrison of the king s troops in the place Being thus obliged to re treat without accomplishing their design they passed over to Canastrum in Pallene and from thence dou bling the promontory of Torona conducted the fleet to Acanthus There they first laid waste the country then stormed the city itself and plundered it They proceeded no farther for their ships were now heavily laden with booty but went back to Sciathus and from Sciathus to Euboea whence they had first set out 46 Leaving the fleet there they entered the Malian bay with ten light ships in order to confer with the jEtolians on the method of conducting the war Si pyrrhicas the jEtolian was at the head of the embassy that came to Heraclea to hold a consultation with the king and the Roman lieutenant general They de manded of Attalus that in pursuance of the treaty he should supply them with one thousand soldiers which number he had engaged for on condition of their taking part in the war against Philip This was refused to the yEtolians because on their part they had formerly showed themselves unwilling to march out to ravage Macedonia at a time when Philip being employed near Pergamus in destroying by fire every thing sacred and profane they might have compelled him to retire from thence in order to preserve his own territories Thus instead of aid the jfitolians were dismissed with hopes the Romans making them large promises Apus tius and Attalus returned to their ships where they 346 livy began to concert measures for the siege of Oreus This city was well secured by fortifications and also since the attempt formerly made on it by a strong garrison After the taking of Andros the combined fleet had been joined by twenty Rhodian ships all decked vessels under the command of Agesimbrotus This squadron they sent to cruise off Zelasium a pro montory of Isthmia very conveniently situate beyond Demetrias in order that if the ships of the Macedo nians should attempt to come out they might be at hand to oppose them Heraclides the king s admiral kept his fleet there rather with a view of laying hold of any advantage which the negligence of the enemy might afford him than with a design of employing open force The Romans and king Attalus carried on their attacks against Oreus on different sides the Romans against the citadel next to the sea the king s troops against the lower part of the town lying between the two cita dels where the city is also divided by a wall As their posts were different so were their methods of attack the Romans made their approaches by means of covered galleries some carried by men others moving on wheels applying also the ram to the walls the king s troops by throwing in weapons with the balista catapulta and every other kind of engine They cast stones also of immense weight formed mines and made use of every expedient which on trial had been found useful in the former siege On the other side the Macedonian garrison in the town and the citadels was not only more numerous than on the former occasion but ex erted themselves with greater spirit in consequence of the reprimands which they had received from the king for their former misconduct and also from remembrance both of his threats and promises with regard to their future behavior so that there was very little hope of its being speedily taken The lieutenant general thought that in the mean time some other business might be accomplished wherefore leaving such a number of men as seemed sufficient to finish the works he passed over to the nearest part of the continent HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXXI 347 and arriving unexpectedly made himself master of Larissa except the citadel â not that celebrated city in Thessaly but another which they call Cremaste Attalus also surprised jEgeleos where nothing was less apprehended than such an enterprise during the siege of another city The works at Oreus had now begun to take effect while the garrison within were almost spent with unremitted toil keeping watch both by day and night and also with wounds Part of the wall being loosened by the strokes of the ram had fallen down in many places and the Romans during the night broke into the citadel through the breach which lay over the harbor Attalus likewise at the first light on a signal given from the citadel by the Romans assaulted the city on his side where great part of the walls had been levelled on which the gar rison and townsmen fled into the other citadel and even that they surrendered in two days after The city fell to the king the prisoners to the Romans 47 The autumnal equinox now approached and the Euboean gulf called Coela is reckoned dangerous by mariners Choosing therefore to remove thence before the winter storms came on they returned to Piraeus from whence they had set out for the campaign Apus tius leaving there thirty ships sailed by Malea to Corcyra The king was delayed during the celebration of the mysteries of Ceres immediately after which he also retired into Asia sending home Agesimbrotus and the Rbodians Such during that summer were the proceedings by sea and land of the Roman consul and lieutenant general aided by Attalns and the Rhodians against Philip and his allies The other consul Caius Aurelius on coming into his province and finding the war there already brought to a conclusion did not dis semble his resentment against the pretor for having proceeded to action in his absence wherefore sending him away to Etruria he led on the legions into the enemy s country where their operations having no other object than booty produced more of it than glory Lucius Furius finding nothing in Etruria that 348 LIVY could give him employment and at the same time fired with ambition of obtaining a triumph for his success against the Gauls which he knew would be more easily accomplished in the absence of the consul who envied and was enraged against him came to Rome unexpectedly and called a meeting of the senate in the temple of Bellona where after making a recital of the services which he had performed he demanded to be allowed to enter the city in triumph 48 A great part of the senate induced by their re gard for him and the importance of his services showed an inclination to grant his request The elder part refused to agree to such grant both because the army with which he had acted belonged to another and because he had left his province through an am bitious desire of snatching that opportunity of pro curing a triumph â a conduct altogether unprece dented The senators of consular rank particularly insisted that  he ought to have waited for the con sul for that he might by pitching his camp near the city and thereby securing the colony without coming to an engagement have protracted the affair until his arrival and that what the pretor had not done the senate ought to do they should wait for the consul After hearing the business discussed by the consul and pretor in their presence they would be able on better grounds to form a judgment on the case Great part were of opinion that they ought to consider nothing but the service performed and whether he had per formed it while in office and under his own auspices for  when of two colonies which had been opposed as barriers to restrain the tumultuous inroads of the Gauls one had been already sacked and burned the flames being ready to spread as if from an adjoining house to the other which lay so near what ought the pretor to have done If it was improper to enter on any action without the consul then the senate had acted wrong in giving the army to the pretor j because if they chose that the business should be performed not under the pretor s auspices but the consul s they HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXXI 349 might have limited the decree in such a manner that not the pretor but the consul should have the manage ment of it or else the consul had acted wrong who after ordering the army to remove from Etruria into Gaul did not meet it at Ariminum in order to be present at operations which were not allowed to be performed without him But the exigences of war do not wait for the delays and procrastinations of commanders and battles must be sometimes fought not because com manders choose it but because the enemy compels it The fight itself and the issue of the fight is what ought to be regarded now The enemy were routed and slain their camp taken and plundered the colony relieved from a siege the prisoners taken from the other colony recovered and restored to their friends and an end put to the war in one battle And not only men re joiced at this victory but the immortal gods also had supplications paid to them for the space of three days on account of the business of the state having been wisely and successfully not rashly and unfortunately conducted by Lucius Furius pretor Besides the Gallic wars were by some fatality destined to the Furian family 49 By means of discourses of this kind made by him and his friends the interest of the pretor who was present prevailed over the respect due to the dignity of the absent consul and the majority decreed a triumph to Lucius Furius Lucius Furius pretor during his office triumphed over the Gauls He carried into the treasury three hundred and twenty thousand asses i and one hundred and seventy thousand pounds weight of silver There were neither any prisoners led before his chariot nor spoils carried before him nor did any soldiers follow him It appeared that every thing except the victory belonged to the consul Publius Scipio then celebrated in a magnificent man ner the games which he had vowed when consul in i 1033 6s 8d 350 LIVY Africa and with respect to the lands for his soldiers it was decreed that whatever number of years each of them had served in Spain or in Africa he should for every year receive two acres and that ten commis sioners should make the distribution Three commis sioners were then appointed to fill up the number of colonists at Venusia because the strength of that co lony had been reduced in the war with Hannibal Caius Terrentius Varro Titus Quintius Flamininus Publius Cornelius son of Cneius Scipio were the commissioners who inrolled the colonists for Ve nusia During the same year Caius Cornelius Ce thegus who in the quality of proconsul commanded in Spain routed a numerous army of the enemy in the territory of Sedeta in which battle it is said that fifteen thousand Spaniards were slain and seventy eight military standards taken The consul Caius Au relius on returning from his province to Rome to hold the elections made heavy complaints not on the subject on which they had supposed he would that the senate had not waited for his coming nor allowed him an opportunity of arguing the matter with the pretor but that  the senate had decreed a triumph in such a manner without hearing the report of any one of those who were present at the operations of the war except the person who was to enjoy the triumph that their ancestors had made it a rule that the lieutenants gene ral the military tribunes the centurions and even the soldiers should be present at the same for this reason that the reality of his exploits to whom so high an honor was paid might be publicly ascertained Now of that army which fought with the Gauls had any one soldier or even a soldier s servant been pre sent of whom the senate could inquire concerning the truth or falsehood of the pretor s narrative He then appointed a day for the elections at which were chosen consuls Lucius Cornelius Lentulus and Publius Vil lius Tappulus The pretors were then appointed Lu cius Quintius Flamininus Lucius Valerius Flaccus HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXXI 351 Lucius Villius Tappulus and Cneius Baebius Tam philus 50 During that year provisions were remarkably cheap The curule ediles Marcus Claudius Marcel lus and Sextus jElius Paetus distributed among the people a vast quantity of corn brought from Africa at the rate of two asses a peck They also celebrated the Roman games in a magnificent manner repeating them a second day and erected in the treasury five brazen statues out of the money paid as fines The plebeian games were thrice repeated intire by the ediles Lu cius Terentius Massa and Cneius Baebius Tamphilus who was elected pretor There were also funeral games exhibited that year in the forum for the space of four days on occasion of the death of Marcus Valerius Lajvinus by his sons Publius and Marcus who gave also a show of gladiators in which twenty five pairs fought Marcus Aurelius Cotta one of the ten com missioners for keeping the books of the Sibyl died and Manius Acilius Glabrio was substituted in his room It happened that both the curule ediles lately chosen were persons who could not immediately un dertake the office for Caius Cornelius Cethegus was absent when he was elected being then commander in Spain and Caius Valerius Flaccus who was present being flamen Dialis could not take the oath of ob serving the laws and no person was allowed to hold any office longer than five days without taking the oath Flaccus petitioned to be excused from comply ing with the law on which the senate decreed that if the edile produced a person approved of by the con suls who would take the oath for him the consuls if they thought proper should make application to the tribunes that it might be proposed to the people Lu cius Valerius Flaccus pretor elect was produced to swear for his brother The tribunes proposed to the commons and the commons ordered that this should be as effectual as if the edile himself had sworn With regard to the other edile likewise an order of the commons was made On the tribunes putting the 352 livy question what two persons they chose should go and take the command of the armies in Spain in order that Caius Cornelius curule edile might come home to execute his office and that Lucius Manlius Acidinus might leave that province where he had continued many years the commons ordered Cneins Cornelius Lentulus and Lucius Stertinius proconsuls to com mand in Spain BOOK XXXII Chap 1 The consuls and pretors entering into office on the ides of March A U C 553 B C 199 cast lots for the provinces Italy fell to Lucius Cornelius Lentulus Macedonia to Publius Villius Of the pre tors the city jurisdiction fell to Lucius Quintius Ariminum to Cneius Basbius Sicily to Lucius Vale rius Sardinia to Lucius Villius The consul Lentu lus was ordered to levy new legions Villius to re ceive the army from Publius Sulpicius and to com plete its number power was given him to raise as many men as he thought proper To the pretor Baebius were decreed the legions which Caius Aurelius late consul had commanded with directions that he should keep them in their present situation until the consul should come with the new army to supply their place and that on his arriving in Gaul all the soldiers who had served out their time should be sent home except five thousand of the allies which would be sufficient to protect the province round Ariminum The command was continued to the pretors of the former year to Cneius Sergius that he might superintend the distri bution of land to the soldiers who had served for HISTORY OF ROME BOOK XXXII 353 many years in Spain Sicily and Sardinia to Quintus Minucius that he might finish the inquiries concerning the conspiracies in Bruttium which while pretor he had managed with care and fidelity That he should also send to Locri to suffer punishment those who had been convicted of sacrilege and who were then in chains at Rome taking care at the same time that whatever had been carried away from the temple of Proserpine should be replaced and proper atonements made The Latine festival was repeated in pursuance of a decree of the pontiffs because ambassadors from Ardea had complained to the senate that during the said solemnity they had not been supplied with meat as usual From Suessa an account was brought that two of the gates and the wall between them were struck with lightning Messengers from Formiae re lated that the temple of Jupiter was also struck by lightning from Ostia likewise news came of the like accident having happened to the temple of Jupiter there it was said too that the temples of Apollo and Sancus at Veliternum were struck in like maimer and that in the temple of Hercules hair grew on the statue A letter was received from Quintus Minucius propretor from Bruttium that a foal had been born with five feet and three chickens with three feet each Afterwards a letter was brought from Macedonia from Publius Sulpicius proconsul in which among other matters it was mentioned that a laurel tree had sprung up on the poop of a ship of war On occasion of the former prodigies the senate had voted that the consuls should offer sacrifices with the greater victims to such gods as they thought proper On account of the last prodigy alone the aruspices were called before the senate and in pursuance of their answer the peo ple were ordered by proclamation to perform a suppli cation for one day and worship was solemnised at all the shrines 2 This year the Carthaginians brought to Rome the first payment of the silver imposed on them as a tri bute and the questors having reported that it was not liv vol v z 3o4 LIVY of the proper standard and that on the assay it wanted a fourth part they borrowed money at Rome and made up the deficiency On their requesting that the senate would be pleased to order their hostages to be restored to them a hundred were given up with as surances in regard to the rest if they continued to ob serve the treaty They then farther requested that the remaining hostages might be removed from Norba where they were ill accommodated to some other place and they were permitted to remove to Signia and Fe rentinum The request of the people of Gades was likewise complied with that a governor should not be sent to their city being contrary to their stipulation with Lucius Marcius Septimus when they came under the protection of the Roman people Deputies from Narnia complaining that they had not their due num ber of settlers and that several who were not of their community had crept in among them and assumed the privileges of colonists Lucius Cornelius consul was ordered to appoint three commissioners to adjust those matters The three appointed werePublius and Sextus jElius both surnamed Paetus and Caius Cornelius Lentulus The favor granted to the Narnians of fill ing up their number of colonists was refused to the people of Cossa who applied for it 3 The consuls having finished the business that was to be done at Rome set out for their provinces Publius Villius on coming into Macedonia found the soldiers in a violent mutiny signs of which had ap peared some time before There were two thousand concerned in it These troops after Hannibal was vanquished had been transported from Africa to Si cily and in about a year after into Macedonia as vo lunteers they denied however that this was done with their consent affirming that they had been put on board the ships by the tribunes contrary to their remonstrances but in what manner soever they had become engaged in that service whether by compul sion or not the time of it was now expired and it was reasonable that some end should be put to their toils For many years they had not seen Italy but had grown HISTORY OF ROME BOOK XXXII 355 old under arms in Sicily Africa and Macedonia they were now in short worn out with labor and fatigue and had lost the best part of their blood by the many wounds which they had received The consul told them that  the grounds on which they demanded their discharge appeared to him to be reasonable if the de mand had been made in a moderate manner but that neither on that nor on any other grounds could mu tiny ever be justified Wherefore if they were con tented to adhere to their standards and obey orders he would write to the senate concerning their release and that what they desired would more easily be ob tained by modest behavior than by turbulence 4 At this time Philip was pushing on the siege of Thaumaci with the utmost vigor by means of mounds and engines and was ready to bring up the ram to the walls when he was obliged to relinquish the un dertaking by the sudden arrival of the jEtolians who under the command of Archidamus having made their way into the town between the posts of the Macedo nians never ceased day or night making continual sallies sometimes against the guards sometimes against the works They were at the same time favored by the nature of the place for Thaumaci stands near the road from ThermopylEe and the Malian bay through Lamia on a lofty eminence hanging immediately over the narrow pass called Caele After passing through the craggy grounds of Thessaly the roads are ren dered intricate by the windings of the valleys and on the near approach to the city such an immense plain opens at once to view like a vast sea that the eye can scarcely reach the bounds of the expanse beneath From this surprising prospect it was called Thaumaci The city itself is secured not only by the height of its situation but by its standing on a rock from the sides of which all round the projecting parts had been pared off In consequence of these difficulties and the prize not appearing sufficient to recompense so much toil and danger Philip desisted from the at tempt The winter also was approaching he there 356 LIVY fore retired from thence and led back his troops into winter quarters in Macedonia 5 There whilst others glad of any interval of rest consigned both body and mind to repose Philip in proportion as the season of the year had relieved him from the incessant fatigues of marching and fighting found his care and anxiety increase the more when he turned his thoughts towards the general issue of the war He dreaded not only his enemies who pressed him hard by land and sea but also the dispositions sometimes of his allies at others of his own subjects The former he thought might be induced by hopes of friendship with the Romans to change sides and the Macedonians themselves be seized with a desire of innovation Wherefore he despatched ambassadors to the Achasans both to require their oath for it had been made an article of their agreement that they should take an oath of fidelity to Philip every year and at the same time to restore to them Orchomenes Heraa and Triphylia To the Megalopolitans he de livered up Aliphera which city they insisted had never belonged to Triphylia but ought to be restored to them having been one of those that were incorpo rated by the council of the Arcadians for the founding of Megalopolis These measures had the desired effect of strengthening his connexion with the Achaeans The affections of the Macedonians he conciliated by his treatment of Heraclides for finding that from having countenanced this man he had incurred the general displeasure of his subjects he charged him with a number of crimes and threw him into chains to the great joy of the people In his preparations for war he exerted the most vigorous efforts exercised both the Macedonian and mercenary troops in arms and in the beginning of spring sent Athenagoras with all the foreign auxiliaries and light troops through Epirus into Chaonia to seize the pass at Antigonia which the Greeks called Stena He followed in a few days with the heavy troops and having viewed every situation in the country he judged that the most advantageous HISTORY OF ROME BOOK XXXII 357 post for fortifying himself was on the river Aous This river runs in a narrow vale between two mountains one of which the natives call the river Asnaus afford ing a passage of very little breadth along the bank He ordered Athenagoras with the light infantry to take possession of Asnaus and to fortify it His own camp he pitched on iEropus Those places where the rocks were steep were defended by guards of a few soldiers only the less secure he strengthened some with trenches some with ramparts and others with towers A great number of engines also were dis posed in proper places that by means of weapons thrown from these they might keep the enemy at a distance The royal pavilion was pitched on the out side of the rampart on the most conspicuous emi nence in order by this show of confidence to dis hearten the foe and raise the hopes of his own men 6 The consul received intelligence from Charopus of Epirus that the king with his army had posted himself in this pass As soon therefore as the spring began to open he left Corcyra where he had passed the winter and sailing over to the continent led on his army When he came within about five miles of the king s camp leaving the legions in a strong post he went forward in person with some light troops to view the nature of the country and on the day fol lowing held a council in order to determine whether he should notwithstanding the great labor and danger to be encountered attempt a passage through the de files occupied by the enemy or lead round his forces by the same road through which Sulpicius had pene trated into Macedonia the year before The delibera tions on this question had lasted several days when news arrived that Titus Quintus had been elected con sul that he had obtained by lot Macedonia as his province and that hastening his journey he had al ready come over to Corcyra Valerius Antias says that Villius marched into the defile and that as he could not proceed straight forward because every pass was occupied by the king he followed the course of a 368 LIVY valley through the middle of which the river Aous flows and having hastily constructed a bridge passed over to the bank where the king lay and fought a battle with him that the king was routed and driven out of his camp that twelve thousand Mace donians were killed and two thousand two hundred taken together with a hundred and thirty two military standards and two hundred and thirty horses He adds that during the battle a temple was vowed to Jupiter in case of success The other historians both Greek and Latin all those at least whose accounts I have read affirm that nothing memorable was done by Villius and that Titus Quintius the consul who succeeded him found that no progress whatever had been made in the business of the war 7 During the time of these transactions in Macedo nia the other consul Lucius Lentulus who had stayed at Rome held an assembly for the election of censors Out of many illustrious men who stood candidates were chosen Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus and Publius jElius Pastus These acting together in per fect harmony read the list of the senate without pass ing a censure on any one member they also let to farm the port duties at Capua and those at the fort of Puteoli situate where the city now stands inrolling for this latter place three hundred colonists that being the number fixed by the senate they also sold the lands of Capua which lie at the foot of Mount Tifata About the same time Lucius Manlius Acidinus on his return from Spain was hindered from entering the city in ovation by Marcus Portius Laeca plebeian tri bune notwithstanding he had obtained permission of the senate coming then into the city in a private character he conveyed to the treasury one thousand two hundred pounds weight of silver and about thirty pounds weight of gold During this year Cneius Bae bius Tamphilus who had succeeded to the government of the province of Gaul in the room of Cains Aure lius consul of the year preceding having without proper caution entered the territories of the Insubrian HISTORY OF ROME BOOK XXXII 359 Gauls was with almost the whole of his army at tacked at disadvantage and overthrown He lost above six thousand six hundred men â a severe blow from an enemy who had for some time ceased to be considered as being formidable This event called away the con sul Lucius Lentulus from the city who arriving in the province which was in general confusion and taking the command of the army which he found dis pirited by its defeat severely reprimanded the pretor and ordered him to quit the province and return to Rome Neither did the consul himself perform any considerable service being called home to preside at the elections which were obstructed by Marcus Ful vius and Manius Curius plebeian tribunes who wished to hinder Titus Quintius Flamininus from standing can didate for the consulship after passing through the of fice of questor They alleged that the edileship and pretorship were now held in contempt and that the nobility did not make their way to the consulship through the regular gradations of offices but passing over the intermediate steps pushed at once from the lowest to the highest From a dispute in the field of Mars the affair was brought before the senate where it was voted that when a person sued for any post which by the laws he was permitted to hold the peo ple had the right of choosing whoever they thought proper To this decision of the senate the tribunes submitted and thereon Sextus jElius Paetus and Titus Quintius Flamininus were elected Then was held the election of pretors The persons chosen were Lucius Cornelius Merula Marcus Claudius Marcellus Marcus Porcius Cato and Cains Helvius who had been ple beian ediles These repeated the plebeian games and on occasion of the games celebrated a feast of Jupiter The curule ediles also Caius Valerius Flaccus who was flamen of Jupiter and Caius Cornelius Cethegus celebrated the Roman games with great magnificence Servius and Caius Sulpicius Galba pontiffs died this year in their room in the college were substituted Marcus jEmilius Lepidus and Cneius Cornelius Scipio 360 LIVY 8 The new consuls Sextus JElius Pastus and Titus Quintius Flamininus on assuming the administration A U C 554 B C 198 convened the senate in the capitol and the fathers decreed that the consuls should settle between themselves or cast lots for the provinces Macedonia and Italy That he to whom Macedonia fell should enlist as a supplement to the legions three thousand Roman footmen and three hundred horse and also five thousand footmen and five hundred horsemen of the Latine confederates The army assigned to the other consul was to consist intirely of new raised men Lucius Lentulus consul of the preceding year was continued in command and was ordered not to depart from the province nor to remove the old army until the consul should arrive with the new legions The consuls cast lots for the provinces and Italy fell to JElim Macedonia to Quin tius Of the pretors the lots gave to Lucius Cornelius Merula the city jurisdiction to Marcus Claudius Si cily to Marcus Poroius Sardinia and to Caius Hel vius Gaul The levying of troops was then begun for besides the consular armies they had been ordered also to enlist men for the pretors for Marcellus in Sicily four thousand foot and three hundred horse of the Latine confederates for Cato in Sardinia three thousand foot and two hundred horse of the same country with directions that both these pretors on their arrival in their provinces should disband the ve terans both foot and horse The consuls then intro duced to the senate ambassadors from king Attalus These after representing that their king gave every assistance to the Roman arms on land and sea with his fleet and all his forces and had hitherto executed with zeal and alacrity every order of the consuls added that they feared it would not be in his power to continue so to do as he was much embarrassed by Antiochus who had invaded his kingdom when the sea and land forces which might have defended it were removed to a distance That Attalus therefore in treated the conscript fathers if they chose to employ HISTORY OF ROME BOOK XXXII 361 his army and navy in the Macedonian war then to send a body of forces to protect his territories or if that were not agreeable to allow him to go home for that purpose with his fleet and troops The following answer was ordered to be given to the ambassadors that the senate retained a due sense of Attalus friend ship in aiding the Roman commanders with his fleet and other forces That they would neither send suc cors to Attalus against Antiochus the ally and friend of the Roman people nor would they detain the troops which he had sent to their assistance to his inconve nience That it was ever a constant rule with the Roman people to use the aid of others so far only as was agreeable to the will of those who gave it and even to leave those who were so inclined at full liberty to determine when that assistance should commence and when it should cease That they would send am bassadors to Antiochus to represent to him that Atta lus with his fleet and army were at the present em ployed by the Roman people against Philip their common enemy and that they would request Antio chus to leave the dominions of Attalus unmolested and to refrain from all hostilities for that it was much to be wished that kings who were allies and friends to the Roman people should maintain friendship be tween themselves also 9 When the consul Titus Quintius had finished the levies in making which he chose principally such as had served in Spain or Africa that is soldiers of ap proved courage and when hastening to set forward to his province he was delayed by reports of prodigies and the expiations of them necessary to be performed There bad been struck by lightning the public road at Veii a temple of Jupiter at Lanuvium a temple of Hercules at Ardea with a wall and towers at Capua also the edifice which is called Alba At Arretium the sky appeared as on fire at Velitrae the earth to the extent of three acres sunk down so as to form a vast chasm From Suessa Aurunca an account was brought of a lamb born with two heads from Sinuessa of a 362 LIVY swine with a human head On occasion of these ill omens a supplication of one day s continuance was performed the consuls employed themselves diligently in the worship of the gods and as soon as these were appeased set out for their provinces jElius accom panied by Caius Helvius pretor went into Gaul where he put under the command of the pretor the army which he received from Lucius Lentnlus and which he ought to have disbanded intending to carry on his own operations with the new troops which he had brought with him but he effected nothing worth recording The other consul Titus Quintins setting sail from Brundusium earlier than had been usual with former consuls reached Corcyra with eight thousand foot and eight hundred horse From this place he passed over in a quinquereme to the nearest part of Epirus and proceeded by long journeys to the Roman camp Here he dismissed Villius and waiting a few days until the forces from Corcyra should come up and join him held a council to determine whether he should endeavor to force his way straight forward through the camp of the enemy or whether without attempting an enterprise of so great difficulty and dan ger he should not rather take a circuitous and safe road so as to penetrate into Macedonia by the country of the Dassaretians and Lycus The latter plan would have been adopted had he not feared that in removing to a greater distance from the sea the enemy might slip out of his hands and that if the king should re solve to secure himself in the woods and wilds as he had done before the summer might be spun out with out any thing being effected It was therefore deter mined be the event what it might to attack the enemy in their present post disadvantageous as it would seem to an assailant But it was easier to resolve on this measure than to devise any safe or certain method of accomplishing it 10 Forty days were passed in view of the enemy without making any kind of effort Hence Philip conceived hopes of bringing about a treaty of peace HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXXII 363 through the mediation of the people of Epirus and a council which was held for the purpose having ap pointed Pausanias the pretor and Alexander the mas ter of the horse as negotiators they brought the con sul and the king to a conference on the banks of the river Aous where the channel was narrowest The sum of the consul s demands was that the king should withdraw his troops from the territories of the several states that to those whose lands and cities he had plundered he should restore such of their effects as could be found and that the value of the rest should be estimated by a fair arbitration Philip answered that the cases of the several states differed widely from each other that such as he himself had seized on he would set at liberty but he would not divest himself of the hereditary and just possessions which had been conveyed down to him from his ancestors If those with whom hostilities had been carried on complained of any losses in the war he was ready to submit the matter to the arbitration of any state with whom both parties were at peace To this the consul replied that the business required neither judge nor arbitrator for who did not see clearly that every in jurious consequence of the war was to be imputed to the first aggressor And in this case Philip unpro voked by any had first commenced hostilities against all When they next began to treat of those nations which were to be set at liberty the consul named first the Thessalians on which the king indignantly exclaimed What harsher terms Titus Quintius could you impose on me if I were vanquished With these words he retired hastily from the conference and they were prevented only by the river which separated them from assaulting each other with missile wea pons On the following day many skirmishes took place between parties sallying from the outposts in a plain sufficiently wide for the purpose Afterwards the king s troops drew back into narrow and rocky places whither the Romans keenly eager for fighting penetrated also These bad in their favor order and 364 LIVY military discipline while their arms were of a kind well calculated for pressing close on the Macedonians who had indeed the advantage of ground with balistas and catapultas disposed on almost every rock as on walls After many wounds given and received on both sides and numbers being slain as in a regular engage ment darkness put an end to the fight 11 While matters were in this state a herdsman sent by Charopus prince of the Epirots was brought to the consul He said that being accustomed to feed his herd in the forest then occupied by the king s camp he knew every winding and path in the neigh boring mountains and that if the consul thought proper to send some troops with him he would lead them by a road neither dangerous nor difficult to a spot over the enemy s head Charopus sent a message to the Ro man to give just so much credit to this man s account as should still leave every thing in his own power and as little as possible in that of the other Though the consul rather wished than dared to give the intelligence full belief and though his emotions of joy were strongly checked by fear yet being moved by the confidence due to Charopus he resolved to put to trial the favor able offer In order to prevent all suspicion of the matter during the two following days he carried on attacks against the enemy without intermission draw ing out troops against them in every quarter and sending up fresh men to relieve the wearied Then selecting four thousand foot and three hundred horse he put them under the command of a military tribune with directions to advance the horse as far as the na ture of the ground allowed and when they came to places impassable to cavalry then to post them in some plain that the infantry should proceed by the road which the guide would show and that when accord ing to his promise they arrived on the height over the enemy s head then they should give a signal by smoke but raise no shout until the tribune should have rea son to think that in consequence of the signal received from him the battle was begun He ordered that the HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXXII 365 troops should march by night the moon shining through the whole of it and employ the day in taking food and rest The most liberal promises were made to the guide provided he fulfilled his engagement he bound him nevertheless and delivered him to the tri bune Having thus sent off this detachment the Ro man general exerted redoubled vigor in every part to make himself master of the posts of the enemy 12 On the third day the Roman party made the sig nal by smoke to notify that they had gained possession of the eminence to which they had been directed and then the consul dividing his forces into three parts marched up with the main strength of his army through a valley in the middle and made the wings on right and left advance to the camp of the enemy Nor did these betray any want of spirit but came out briskly to meet him The Roman soldiers in the ar dor of their courage long maintained the fight on the outside of their works for they had no small superiority in bravery in skill and in the nature of their arms but when the king s troops after many of them were wounded and slain retreated into places secured either by intrenchments or situation the danger reverted on the Romans who pushed forward inconsiderately into disadvantageous grounds and defiles out of which a retreat was difficult Nor would they have extricated themselves without suffering for their rashness had not the Macedonians first by a shout heard in their rear and then by an attack begun on that quarter been utterly dismayed and confounded at the un thought of danger Some betook themselves to a hasty flight some keeping their stand rather because they could find no way for flight than that they pos sessed spirit to support the engagement were cut off by the Romans who pressed them hard both on front and rear Their army might have been intirely de stroyed had the victors continued their pursuit of the fugitives but the cavalry were obstructed by the nar rowness of the passes and the ruggedness of the ground and the infantry by the weight of their ar 366 LIVY mor The king at first fled with precipitation and without looking behind him but afterwards when he had proceeded as far as five miles he began from re collecting the unevenness of the road to suspect what was really the case that the enemy could not fol low him and halting he despatched his attendants through all the hills and valleys to collect the strag glers together His loss was not more than two thou sand men The rest of his army coming to one spot as if they had followed some signal marched off in a compact body towards Thessaly The Romans after having pursued the enemy as far as they could with safety killing such as they overtook and despoiling the slain seized and plundered the king s camp to which even when there were no troops to oppose them they could not easily make their way The following night they were lodged within their own trenches 13 Next day the consul pursued the enemy through the same defiles following the course of the river as it winds through the valleys The king came first to the camp of Pyrrhus a place so called in Triphylia a dis trict of Melotis and on the following day by a very long march his fears urging him on he reached Mount Lingos This ridge of mountains belongs to Epirus and stretches along between Macedonia and Thessaly the side next to Thessaly faces the east that next to Macedonia the north These hills are thickly clad with woods and on their summits have open plains and springs of water Here Philip re mained encamped for several days being unable to de termine whether he should continue his retreat until he arrived in his own dominions or whether he might venture back into Thessaly At length he resolved to direct his route into Thessaly and going by the shortest roads to Tricca he made hasty excursions from thence to all the cities within his reach The in habitants who were able to accompany him he carried away from their habitations and burned the towns allowing the owners to take with them such of their HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXXII 867 effects as they were able to carry the rest became the prey of the soldiers nor was there any kind of cruelty which they could have suffered from an enemy that they did not suffer from these their confederates The infliction of such hardships was irksome to Philip even while he authorised it but as the country was soon to become the property of the foe he wished to rescue out of it their persons at least In this manner were ravaged the towns of Phacium Iresia Euhy drium Eretria and Palasphatus On his coming to Pherae the gates were shut against him and as it would necessarily occasion a considerable delay if he attempted to take it by force and as he could not spare time he dropped the design and crossed over the mountains into Macedonia for he had received intelligence that the JEtolians too were marching to wards him These on hearing of the battle fought on the banks of the river Aous first laid waste the near est tracts round Sperchia and Long Come as it is called and then passing over into Thessaly got pos session of Cymine and Angea at the first assault From Metropolis they were repulsed by the inha bitants who while a part of their army was plunder ing the country assembled in a body to defend the city Afterwards making an attempt on Callithere they were attacked by the townsmen in a like manner but withstood their onset with more steadiness drove back into the town the party which had sallied and content with that success as they had scarcely any prospect of taking the place by storm retired They then took by assault and sacked the towns of Theuma and Calathas Achorrae they gained by surrender Xynias through similar apprehensions was abandoned by the inhabitants These having forsaken their homes and going together in a body fell in with a party of Athamanians employed in protecting their foragers all of whom an irregular and unarmed mul titude incapable of any resistance were put to the sword by the troops The deserted town of Xyniae was plundered The jEtolians then took Cyphara a 368 LIVY fort conveniently situated on the confines of Dolopia All this the Etolians performed within the space of a few days 14 Amynander and the Athamanians when they heard of the victory obtained by the Romans conti nued not inactive Amynander having little confi dence in his own troops requested aid from the con sul and then advancing towards Gomphi he stormed on his march a place called Pheca situate between that town and the narrow pass which separates Thes saly from Athamania He then attacked Gomphi and though the inhabitants defended it for several days with the utmost vigor yet as soon as he had raised the scaling ladders to the walls the same ap prehensions which had operated on others made them capitulate This capture of Gomphi spread the great est consternation among the Thessalians their for tresses of Argenta Pherinus Thimarus Lisinae Sti mon and Lampsus surrendered one after another with several other garrisons equally inconsiderable While the Athamanians and iEtolians delivered from fear of the Macedonians converted to their own profit the fruits of another s victory and Thessaly ravaged by three armies at once knew not which to believe its foe or its friend the consul marched on through the pass which the enemy s flight had left open into the country of Epirus Though he well knew which party the Epirots excepting their prince Charopus were disposed to favor yet as he saw that even from the motive of atoning for past behavior they obeyed his orders with diligence he regulated his treatment of them by the standard of their present rather than of their former temper and by this readiness to pardon conciliated their affection for the future Then send ing orders to Corcyra for the transport ships to come into the Ambrician bay he advanced by moderate marches and on the fourth day pitched his camp on Mount Cercetius Hither he ordered Amynander to come with his auxiliary troops not so much because he wanted such addition of his forces as with design HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXXII 369 to use them as guides into Thessaly With the same purpose many volunteers of the Epirots also were ad mitted into the corps of auxiliaries 15 Of the cities of Thessaly the first which he at tacked was Phaleria The garrison here consisted of two thousand Macedonians who made at first a most vigorous resistance availing themselves to the utmost of every advantage that their arms and works could afford The assault was carried on without intermis sion or relaxation either by day or by night because the consul thought that it would have a powerful effect on the spirits of the rest of the Thessalians if the first who made trial of the Roman strength were unable to withstand it and this at the same time sub dued the obstinacy of the Macedonians On the re duction of Phaleria deputies came from Metropolis and Piera surrendering those cities To them on their petition pardon was granted Phaleria was sacked and burned He then proceeded to yEginium but finding this place so circumstanced that even with a moderate garrison it was safe after discharging a few weapons against the nearest advanced guard he di rected his march towards the territory of Gomphi and thence into the plains of Thessaly His army was now in want of every thing because he had spared the lands of the Epirots he therefore despatched mes sengers to learn whether the transports had reached Leucas and the Ambracian bay sending the cohorts in turn to Ambracia for corn Now the road from Gomphi to Ambracia although difficult and embar rassed is very short so that in a few days provisions were brought up from the sea in abundance He then marched to Atrax which is about ten miles from La rissa on the river Peneus The inhabitants came ori ginally from Perrhasbia The Thessalians here were not in the least alarmed at the first coming of the Ro mans and Philip although be durst not himself ad vance into Thessaly yet keeping bis station in the vale of Tempe whenever any place was attempted by liv vol v 2 a 370 Liw the enemy he sent up reinforcements as occasion re quired 16 About the time that Quintius first pitched his camp opposite to Philip s and at the entrance of Epi rus Lucius the consul s brother whom the senate had commissioned both to the naval command and to the government of the coast sailed over with two quinque remes to Corcyra and when he learned that the fleet had departed thence thinking any delay improper he followed and overtook it at the island of Zama Here he dismissed Luci us Apustius in whose room he had been appointed and then proceeded to Ma lea but at a slow rate being obliged for the most part to tow the vessels which accompanied him with provisions From Malea after ordering the rest to follow with all possible expe dition himself with three light quinqueremes hastened forward to the Piraeus and took under his command the ships left there by Lucius Apustius lieutenant general for the protection of Athens At the same time two fleets set sail from Asia one of twenty four quinqueremes under king Attalus the other belonging to the Rhodians consisting of twenty decked ships and commanded by Agesimbrotus These fleets joining near the island of Andros sailed for Euboea to reach which place they had only to cross a narrow channel They first ravaged the lands belonging to Carystus  but judging that city too strong in consequence of a reinforcement hastily sent from Chalcis they bent their course to Eretria Lucius Quintius also on hearing of the arrival of king Attalus came thither with the ships which had lain at the Pirasus having left orders that his own ships should as they arrived foll6w him to Euboea The siege of Eretria was now pushed forward with the ut most vigor for the three combined fleets carried ma chines and engines of all sorts for the demolition of towns and the adjacent country offered abundance of timber for the construction of new works At the be ginning the townsmen defended themselves with a good degree of spirit afterwards when they felt the effects of fatigue a great many being likewise wounded HISTORY OF ROME BOOK XXXII 371 and a part of the wall demolished by the enemy s works they became disposed to capitulate But they had a garrison of Macedonians of whom they stood in no less dread than of the Romans and Philocles the king s general sent frequent messages from Chalcis that he would bring them succor in due time if they could hold out the siege The hope of this in con junction with their fears obliged them to protract the time longer than was consistent either with their wishes or their strength However having learned soon after that Philocles had been repulsed in the attempt and forced to fly back in disorder to Chalcis they instantly sent deputies to Attalns to beg pardon and protection While intent on the prospect of peace they remitted their diligence in the duties of war and kept armed guards in that quarter only where the breach had been made in the wall neglecting all the rest Quintius made an assault by night on the side where it was least apprehended and carried the town by scalade The townsmen with their wives and children fled into the citadel but soon after surrendered themselves pri soners The quantity of money of gold and silver taken was not great Of statues and pictures the works of ancient artists and other ornaments of that kind a greater number was found than could be ex pected either from the size of the city or its opulence in other particulars 17 The design on Carystus was then resumed and the fleets sailed thither on which the whole body of the inhabitants before the troops were disembarked deserted the city and fled into the citadel whence they sent deputies to beg protection from the Roman general To the townspeople life and liberty were immediately granted and it was ordered that the Macedonians should pay a ransom of three hundred drachmas a head deliver up their arms and quit the country After being thus ransomed they were transported un armed to Boeotia The combined fleets having in the 91 13s 9d 372 LIVY space of a few days taken these two important cities of Eubeea sailed round Sunium a promontory of Attica and steered their course to Cenchrea the grand mart of the Corinthians In the mean time the consul found the siege of Atrax more tedious than he had imagined the enemy making an unexpected re sistance He had supposed that the whole of the trouble would be in demolishing the wall and that if he could once open a passage for his soldiers into the city the consequence would then be the flight and slaughter of the enemy as usually happens on the capture of towns But when on a breach being made in the wall by the rams and when the soldiers by mounting over the ruins had entered the place this proved only the beginning as it were of an unusual and fresh labor for the Macedonians in garrison who were both chosen men and many in number supposing that they would be intitled to extraordinary honor if they should maintain the defence of the city by means of arms and courage rather than by the help of walls formed themselves in a compact body strengthening their line by an uncommon number of files in depth These when they saw the Romans entering by the breaches drove them back so that they were en tangled among the rubbish and with difficulty could effect a retreat This gave the consul great uneasi ness for he considered such a disgrace not merely as it retarded the reduction of a single city but as likely to affect materially the whole process of the war which in general depends much on the influence of events in themselves unimportant Having therefore cleared the ground about the half ruined wall he brought up a tower of extraordinary height consisting of many stories and which carried a great number of soldiers He likewise sent up the cohorts in strong bodies one after another to force their way if possible through the wedge of the Macedonians which is called a pha lanx But in such a confined space for the wall was thrown down to no great extent the enemy had the advantage both in the kind of weapons which they HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXXII 373 used and in the manner of fighting When the Mace donians in close array stretched out before them their long spears against the target fence which was formed by the close position of their antagonists shields and when the Romans after discharging their javelins without effect drew their swords these could neither press on to a closer combat nor cut off the heads of the spears and if they did cut or break off any the shaft being sharp at the part where it was broken filled up its place among the points of those which were unbroken in a kind of palisade Besides this the parts of the wall still standing covered safely the flanks of the Macedonians who were not obliged either in retreating or in advancing to an attack to pass through a long space which generally occasions dis order in the ranks An accidental circumstance also helped to confirm their courage for as the tower was moved along a bank not sufficiently compacted one of the wheels sinking into a rut made the tower lean in such a manner that it appeared to the enemy as if fall ing and threw the soldiers posted on it into consterna tion and affright 18 As none of his attempts met any sucoess the consul was very unwilling to allow the difference be tween the two kinds of soldiery and their weapons to be manifested in such trials at the same time he could neither see any prospect of reducing the place speedily nor any means of subsisting in winter at such a distance from the sea and in a country deso lated by the calamities of war He therefore raised the siege and as along the whole coast of Acarnania and iEtolia there was no port capable of containing all the transports that brought supplies to the army nor any place which afforded lodgings to the legions he pitched on Anticyra in Phocis on the Corinthian gulf as most commodiously situated for his purpose There the legions would be at no great distance from Thessaly and the places belonging to the enemy while they would have in front Peloponnesus sepa rated from them by a narrow sea on their rear 374 LIVY jEtolia and Acarnania and on their sides Locris and Boeotia Phanotea in Phocis he took without difficulty at the first assault The siege of Anticyra gave him not much delay Then Ambrysis and Hyam polis were taken Daulis being situated on a lofty eminence could not be reduced either by scalade or works he therefore provoked the garrison by missile weapons to make sallies from out the town Then by flying at one time pursuing at another and engaging in slight skirmishes he led them into such a degree of carelessness and such a contempt of him that at length the Romans mixing with them as they ran back entered by the gates and stormed the town Six other fortresses in Phocis of little consequence came into his hands through fear rather than by force of arms Elatia shut its gates and the inhabitants seemed determined not to admit within their walls either the army or the general of the Romans unless compelled by force 19 While the consul was employed in the siege of Elatia a prospect opened to him of effecting a business of much more importance of being able to prevail on the Achaeans to renounce their alliance with Philip and attach themselves to the Romans Gycliades the head of the faction that favored the interest of Philip they had now banished and Aristainus who wished for a union between his countrymen and the Romans was pretor The Roman fleet with Attalus and the Rhodians lay at Cenchrea and were preparing to lay siege to Corinth with their whole combined force The consul therefore judged it prudent that before they entered on that affair ambassadors should be sent to the Aohasan state with assurances that if they came over from the king to the side of the Romans the latter would consign Corinth to them and annex it to the old confederacy of their nation Accordingly by the consul s direction ambassadors were sent to the Achas ans by his brother Lucius Quintius by Attalus and by the Rhodians and Atheniansâ a general assembly being summoned to meet at Sicyon to give them audi HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXXII 375 etice Now the minds of the Achwans labored with a complication of difficulties They feared the Lacedae monians their constant and inveterate enemies they dreaded the arms of the Romans they were under obligations to the Macedonians for services both of ancient and of recent date but the king himself on account of his perfidy and cruelty they looked on with jealous fear and not judging from the behavior which he then assumed for the time they knew that on the conclusion of the war they should find him a more tyrannic master So that every one of them was not only at a loss what opinion he should support in the senate of his own particular state or in the general diets of the nation but even when they deliberated within themselves they could not with any certainty determine what they ought to wish or what to prefer Such was the unsettled state of mind of the members of the assembly when the ambassadors were intro duced to audience The Roman ambassador Lucius Calpurnius spoke first next the ambassadors of king Attalus after them those of the Rhodians and then Philip s The Athenians were heard the last that they might refute the discourses of the Macedonians These inveighed against the king with the greatest acrimony of any for no others had suffered from him so many and so severe hardships So great a number of speeches succeeding each other took up the whole of the day and about sunset the council was ad journed 20 Next day the council met again and when the magistrates according to the custom of the Greeks gave leave by their herald to any person who chose to deliver his sentiments not one stood forth but they sat a long time looking on each other in silence It was no wonder that men revolving in their minds matters of such contradictory natures and who found themselves puzzled and confounded should be involved in additional perplexity by the speeches continued through the whole preceding day in which the diffi culties on all sides were brought into view and stated 376 livy in their full force At length Aristssnus the pretor of the Achaeans not to dismiss the council without any business being introduced said Acheeans where are now those violent disputes in which at your feasts and meetings whenever mention was made of Philip and the Romans you scarcely refrained from blows Now in a general assembly summoned on that single business when you have heard the arguments of the ambassadors on both sides when the magistrates de mand your opinions when the herald calls you to de clare your sentiments you are struck dumb Although your concern for the common safety be insufficient for determining the matter cannot the party zeal which has attached you to one side or the other extort a word from any one of you especially when none is so blind as not to perceive that the time for declaring and re commending what each either wishes or thinks most advisable must be at the present moment that is be fore we make any decree When a decree shall be once passed every man even such as at first may have disapproved the measure must then support it as good and salutary These persuasions of the pretor so far from prevailing on any one person to declare his opi nion did not excite in all that numerous assembly col lected out of so many states so much as a murmur or a whisper 21 Then the pretor Aristaenus proceeded thus â Chiefs of Achaea you are not more at a loss what ad vice to give than you are for words to deliver it in but every one is unwilling to promote the interest of the public at the risk of danger to himself Were I in a private character perhaps I too should be silent but as pretor it is my duty to declare that I see evidently either that the ambassadors ought to have been refused an audience of the council or that they ought not to be dismissed from it without an answer Yet how can I give them an answer unless by a decree of yours And since not one of you who have been called to this assembly either chooses or dares to make known his sentiments let us examine as if they were opinions HISTORY OF ROME BOOK XXXII 377 proposed to our consideration the speeches of the am bassadors delivered yesterday supposing for a mo ment the speakers not to have required what was use ful to themselves but to have recommended what they thought most conducive to our advantage The Ro mans the Rhodians and Attalus request an alliance and friendship with us and they demand to be assisted in the war which they are now engaged in against Philip Philip reminds us of our league with him and of the obligation of our oath he requires only that we declare ourselves on his side and says he will be satisfied if we do not intermeddle in the opera tions of the war Who is there so short sighted as not to perceive the reason why those who are not yet our allies require more than he who is This arises not from modesty in Philip nor from the want of it in the Romans The Achaean harbors show what it is which while it bestows confidence to requisitions on one side precludes it on the other We see nothing belonging to Philip but his ambassador the Roman fleet lies at Cenchrea exhibiting to our view the spoils of the ci ties of Eubosa We behold the consul and his legions at the distance of a small tract of sea overrunning Phocis and Locris You were surprised at Philip s ambassador Cleomedon showing such diffidence yes terday in his application to us to take arms on the side of the king against the Romans But if we in pursu ance of the same treaty and oath the obligation of which he inculcated on us were to ask of him that Philip should protect us both from Nabis and his La cedaemonians and also from the Romans he would be utterly unable to find not only a force for the purpose but even an answer to return As much so in truth as was Philip himself who endeavored by promises of waging war against Nabis to draw away our youth into Euboea but finding that we would neither decree such assistance to him nor choose to be embroiled with Rome forgot that alliance on which he now lays such stress and left us to the Lacedaemonians to be spoiled and plundered Besides to me the arguments of Cleo 378 LIVY medon appeared utterly inconsistent He made light of the war with the Romans and asserted that the issue of it would be similar to that of the former which they waged against Philip If such be the case why does he at a distance solicit our assistance rather than come hither in person and defend us his old al lies both from Nabis and from the Romans Us do I say Why then has he suffered Eretria and Ca rystus to be taken Why so many cities of Thessaly Why Locris and Phocis Why does he at present suffer Elatia to be besieged Did he either through compulsion or fear or choice quit the straits of Epi rus and those impregnable fastnesses on the river Aous and why abandoning the possession of the pass did he retire into his own kingdom If of his own will he gave up so many allies to the ravages of the enemy what objection can he make to these allies after his example taking care of themselves If through fear he ought to pardon the like fear in us if his retreat was in consequence of a defeat let me ask you Cleomedon shall we Achasans be able to withstand the Roman arms which you Macedonians have not withstood Are we to give credit to your assertion that the Romans do not employ in the pre sent war greater forces or greater strength than they did in the former or are we to regard the real facts In the first instance they aided the iEtolians with a fleet they sent not to the war either a consul as com mander or a consular army The maritime cities of Philip s allies were in terror and confusion but the inland places so secure against the Roman arms that Philip ravaged the country of the JEtolians while they in vain implored succor from those arms Whereas in the present case the Romans after bringing to a final conclusion the Punic war which raging for six teen years in the bowels as it were of Italy had given them abundance of trouble sent not auxiliaries to the jEtolians in their quarrels but being themselves prin cipals made a hostile invasion on Macedonia with land and sea forces at once Their third consul is now HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXXII 379 pushing forward the war with the utmost vigor Sul picius engaging the king within the territory of Mace donia itself routed and utterly defeated him and af terwards despoiled the most opulent part of his king dom Then again when he was in possession of the strait of Epirus where from the nature of the ground his fortifications and the strength of his army he thought himself secure Quintius drove him out of his camp pursued him as he fled into Thessaly and almost in the view of Philip himself stormed the royal garrisons and the cities of his allies Supposing that there were no truth in what the Athenian ambassadors mentioned yesterday respecting the cruelty avarice and lust of the king supposing the crimes committed in the country of Attica against the gods celestial and infernal concerned us not at all that we had less to complain of than what the people of Cius and Abydos who are far distant from us have endured let us then if you please forget even our own wounds let the murders and ravages committed at Messena and in the heart of Peloponnesus the killing of his host Garitenes at Cyparissia in the midst of a feast in contempt of laws divine and human the murder of the two Aratuses of Sicyon father and son though be was wont to call the unfortunate old man his parent his carrying away the son s wife into Macedonia for the gratification of his vicious appetites and all his violations of virgins and matrons â let all these I say be forgotten let all be consigned to oblivion Let us suppose our business were not with Philip through dread of whose cruelty you are all thus struck dumb for what other cause could keep you silent when yon have been summoned to a council Let us imagine that we are treating with Antigonus a prince of the greatest mildness and equity to whose kindness we have all been highly indebted would he require us to perform what at the time was impossible Pelopon nesus is a peninsula united to the continent by a nar row isthmus particularly exposed and open to the at tacks of naval armaments Now if a hundred decked 380 LIVY ships and fifty lighter open ones and thirty Issean barks shall begin to lay waste our coasts and attack the cities which stand exposed almost on the very shore â shall we then retreat into the inland towns as if we were not afflicted with an intestine war though in truth it is rankling in our very bowels When Nabis and the Lacedaemonians by land and the Roman fleet by sea shall press us where must I implore the support due from the king s alliance where the suc cors of the Macedonians  Shall we ourselves with our own arms defend against the Roman forces the cities that will be attacked Truly in the former war we defended Dymse excellently well The calamities of others afford us abundant examples let us not seek to render ourselves an example to the rest Do not because the Romans voluntarily desire your friend ship contemn that which you ought to have prayed for nay labored with all your might to obtain But it is insinuated that they are impelled by fear in a country to which they are strangers and that wishing to shelter themselves under your assistance they have recourse to your alliance in the hope of being admitted into your harbors and of there finding supplies of pro visions Now at sea they are absolute masters and instantly reduce to subjection every place at which they land What they request they have power to en force Because they wish to treat you with tender ness they do not allow you to take steps that must lead you to ruin Cleomedon lately pointed out as the middle and safest way to maintain a neutrality but that is not a middle way it is no way for be sides the necessity of either embracing or rejecting the Roman alliance what other consequence can ensue from such conduct than that while we show no steady attachment to either side as if we waited the event with design to adapt our counsels to fortune we shall bscome the prey of the conqueror Contemn not then when it is offered to your acceptance what you ought to have solicited with your warmest prayers The free option between the two which you have this HISTORY OF ROME BOOK XXXII 381 day you will not always have The same opportunity will not last long nor will it frequently recur You have long wished to deliver yourselves out of the hands of Philip although you have not dared to make the attempt Those have now crossed the sea with large fleets and armies who are able to set you at liberty without any trouble or danger to yourselves If you reject such allies the soundness of your understand ings may be called in question but you must unavoid ably have to deal with them either as friends or foes 22 This speech of the pretor was followed by a general murmur some declaring their approbation and others sharply rebuking those who did so And now not only individuals but whole states engaged in altercation and at length the magistrates called de miurguses who are ten in number took up the dispute with as much warmth as the multitude Five of them declared that they would propose the question concern ing an alliance with Rome and would take the votes on it while five insisted that there was a law by which the magistrates were prohibited from proposing and the council from decreeing any thing injurious to the alliance with Philip This day also was spent in contention and there remained now but one day more of the regular time of sitting for according to the rule the decree must be passed on the third day and as that approached the zeal of the parties was kindled into such a flame that scarcely did parents refrain from offering violence to their own sons There was present a man of Pallene named Rhisiasus whose son Mem non was a demiurgus and was of that party which op posed the reading of the decree and taking the votes This man for a long time intreated his son to allow the Achaeans to take proper measures for their common safety and not by his obstinacy to bring ruin on the whole nation but finding that his intreaties had no effect he swore that he would treat him not as a son but as an enemy and would put him to death with his own hand By these threats he forced him next day to join the party that voted for the question being pro LIVY posed These having now become the majority pro posed the question accordingly while almost every one of the states openly approving the measure showed plainly on which side they would vote Whereon the Dymaeans Megalopolitans with several of the Argives rose up and withdrew from the council which step excited neither wonder nor disapprobation for when in the memory of their grandfathers the Megalopoli tans had been expelled their country by the Lacedae monians Antigonus had reinstated them in their native residence and at a later period when Dymas was taken and sacked by the Roman troops Philip ordered that the inhabitants wherever they were in servitude should be ransomed and not only restored them to their liberty but their country As to the Argives besides believing that the royal family of Macedonia derived its origin from them the greater part were at tached to Philip by personal acts of kindness and fa miliar friendship For these reasons when the coun cil appeared disposed to order an alliance to be con cluded with Rome they withdrew  and their secession was readily excused in consideration of the many and recent obligations by which they were bound to the king of Macedon 23 The rest of the Achaean states on their opinions being demanded ratified by an immediate decree the alliance with Attalus and the Rhodians That with the Romans as it could not be perfected without an order from the people they deferred until such time as they could hear from Rome For the present it wa9 resolved that three ambassadors should be sent to Lu cius Quintius and that the whole force of the Achae ans should be brought up to Corinth which city Quin tius after taking Cenchrea was then besieging The Achaeans accordingly pitched their camp opposite to the gate that leads to Sicyon The Romans made their approaches on the side of the city which faces Cenchrea Attalus having drawn his army across the isthmus towards Lechssum the port on the opposite sea At first they did not push forward their opera HISTORY OF ROME BOOK XXXII 383 tions with any great degree of vigor because they had hopes of a dissension breaking out between the towns men and the king s troops but afterwards learning that they all co operated with unanimity that the Macedonians exerted themselves as if in defence of their native country and that the Corinthians sub mitted to the orders of Androsthenes commander of the garrison as if he were their countryman elected by their own suffrages and invested with legal autho rity â the assailants had no other hopes but in force arms and their works They therefore brought up their mounds to the walls though by very difficult ap proaches On that side where the Romans attacked their ram demolished a considerable part of the wall and the Macedonians having run together to defend the place thus stripped of its works a furious conflict ensued At first by reason of the enemy s superiority in number the Romans were quickly repulsed but being joined by the auxiliary troops of Attalus and the Achaeans they restored the fight to an equality so that there was no doubt of their easily driving the Macedonians and Greeks from their ground but that there were in the town a great multitude of Italian de serters some of whom having been in Hannibal s army had through fear of being punished by the Ro mans followed Philip others having been sailors had lately quitted the fleets in hopes of more honor able employment despair of safety therefore in case of the Romans getting the better inflamed these to a degree which might rather be called madness than courage Opposite to Sicyon is the promontory of Juno Acrsea as she is called stretching out into the main the passage to Corinth being about seven miles To this place Philocles one of the king s generals led through Boeotia fifteen hundred soldiers and there were barks from Corinth ready to take these troops on board and carry them over to Lechasum Attalus on this advised to burn the works and raise the siege immediately Quintius was inclined to persevere in the attempt However when he saw the king s troops 384 livY posted at all the gates and that the sallies of the be sieged could not easily be withstood be came over to the opinion of Attains Thus baffled in their design they dismissed the Acbaeans and returned to their ships Attalus steered to Piraeus the Romans to Cor ey ra 24 While the naval forces were thus employed the consul having encamped before Elatia in Pbocis first endeavored by conferring with the principal inhabi tants to bring them over and by their means to effect his purpose but on their answering that they had no thing in their power because the king s troops were more numerous and stronger than the townsmen be assaulted the city on all sides at once with arms and engines A battering ram shattered a part of the wall that reached from one tower to another and this fall ing with a prodigious noise and crash left much of the town exposed On this a Roman cohort made an as sault through the breach while at the same time the townsmen quitting their several posts ran together from all parts to the endangered place Others of the Romans climbed over the ruins of the wall and brought up scaling ladders to the parts that were standing As the conflict attracted the eyes and attention of the enemy to one particular spot the walls were scaled in several places by which means the soldiers easily entered the town The noise and tumult which ensued so terrified the enemy that quitting the place which they had crowded together to defend they all fled in panic to the citadel accompanied by the unarmed multitude The consul having thus become master of the town gave it up to be plundered and then sent a messenger into the citadel offering the king s troops their lives on condition of their laying down their arms and de parting To the Elatians he offered their liberty which terms being agreed to in a few days after he got possession of the citadel 25 In consequence of Philocles the king s general coming into Achaia not only Corinth was delivered from the siege but the city of Argos was betrayed into HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXXII 385 his bands by some of the principal inhabitants after they had first sounded the minds of the populace They bad a custom that on the first day of assembly their pretors for the omen s sake should pronounce the names Jupiter Apollo and Hercules in addition to which a rule had been made that along with these they should join the name of king Philip After the conclusion of the alliance with the Romans the herald omitted so to honor him on which a murmur spread through the multitude and they soon became clamor ous calling out for the name of Philip and insisting that the respect due by law should be paid as be fore which at length being complied with universal approbation ensued On the encouragement afforded by this favorable disposition Philocles was invited who seized in the night a strong post called Larissa seated on a hill which overhangs the city and in which he placed a garrison At the dawn of day however and as he was proceeding in order of battle to the forum at the foot of the hill he was met by a line of troops drawn up to oppose him This was a body of Achaeans lately posted there consisting of about five hundred young men selected out of all the states Their commander was iEnesidemus of Dymae The king s general sent a person to recommend to them to evacuate the city because they were not a match for the townsmen alone who favored the cause of Philip much less when these were joined by the Macedonians whom even the Romans had not withstood at Corinth This at first had no effect either on the commander or his men and when they soon after perceived the Ar gives also in arms coming in a great body from the opposite side and threatening them with destruction they yet seemed determined to run every hazard if their leader would persevere But jEnesidemus un willing that the flower of the Achasan youth should be lost together with the city made terms with Phi locles that they should have liberty to retire while himself remained armed with a few of his dependents and without even stirring from his station To a per liv vol v 2 b 386 LIVY son sent by Philocles to inquire what he meant he only answered standing with his shield held out be fore him that he meant to die in arms in defence of the city intrusted to his charge Philocles then or dered some Thracians to throw their javelins at him and his attendants and they were every man of them slain Thus notwithstanding the alliance concluded by the Achaeans with the Romans two of their cities and those of the greatest consequence Argos and Co rinth were still in the hands of Philip Such were the services performed in that campaign by the land and sea forces of Rome employed in Greece 20 In Gaul the consul Sextus jElius did nothing worth mention though he had two armies in the pro vince one which he had retained under their stand ards although it ought to have been disbanded and of this which had served under Lucius Cornelius pro consul he had given the command to Caius Helvius the pretor the other he had brought with him He spent nearly the whole summer in compelling the peo ple of Cremona and Placentia to return to their colo nies from whence they had been driven to various places by the calamities of war While Gaul beyond expectation remained quiet through the whole year an insurrection of the slaves was very near taking place in the neighborhood of the city The hostages given by the Carthaginians were kept in custody at Setia as they were the children of the principal fa milies they were attended by a great multitude of slaves to this number many were added in conse quence of the late African war and by the Setians themselves having bought from among the spoil se veral of those which had been captured Having con spired together they sent some of their number to en gage in the cause their fellows of the country round Setia with those at Norba and Circeii When every thing was fully prepared they determined during the games which were soon to be solemnised at the first mentioned place to attack the people while intent on the show and putting them to death to make them HISTORY OF ROME 387 â BOOK XXXII selves masters of the city in the sudden confusion and then to seize on Norba and Circeii Information of this atrocious plot was brought to Rome to Lucius Cornelius Merula the city pretor Two slaves came to him before day and disclosed the whole proceedings and intentions of the conspirators The pretor order ing them to be guarded in his own house summoned a meeting of the senate and having laid before them the information of the discoverers he was ordered to go himself to the spot and examine into and crush the conspiracy Setting out accordingly with five lieutenants general he compelled such as he found in the country to take the military oath to arm and follow him Having by this tumultuary kind of levy armed about two thousand men before it was possible to guess his destination he came to Setia There the leaders of the conspiracy were instantly apprehended on which the remainder fled from the city but parties were sent through the country to search them out The services of the two who made the discovery and of one free person employed were highly meritorious The senate ordered a present to the latter of a hundred thousand asses i to the slaves twenty five thousand asses3 each and their freedom The price was paid to the ir owners out of the treasury Not long after intelligence was received that others out of the re maining spirit of the conspiracy had formed a design of seizing Prameste The pretor Lucius Cornelius went thither and inflicted punishment on near five hundred persons concerned in that wicked scheme The public were under apprehensions that the Car thaginian hostages and prisoners fomented these plots watches were therefore kept at Rome in all the streets which the inferior magistrates were ordered to go round and inspect while the triumvirs of the pri son called the Quarry were to keep a stricter guard than usual Circular letters were also sent by the pretor to all the Latine states directing that the hos 1 322 18s id  80 14s Td 388 LIVY tages should be confined within doors and not at any time allowed the liberty of going into public and that the prisoners should be kept bound with fetters of not less than ten pounds weight and confined in the common jail 27 In this year ambassadors from king Attalus made an offering in the capitol of a golden crown of two hundred and fifty six pounds weight and returned thanks to the senate because Antiochus complying with the requisitions of the Romans had withdrawn his troops out of Attalus territories During this summer two hundred horsemen ten elephants and two hundred thousand pecks of wheat were furnished by king Masinissa to the army in Greece From Sicily also and Sardinia large supplies of provisions were sent with clothing for the troops Sicily was then governed by Marcus Marcellus Sardinia by Marcus Porcius Cato a man of acknowleged integrity and pu rity of conduct but deemed too severe in punishing usury He drove the usurers intirely out of the island and restricted or abolished the contributions usually paid by the allies for maintaining the dignity of the pretors The consul Sextus jElins coming home from Gaul to Rome to hold the elections elected consuls Caius Cornelius Cethegus and Quintus Minu cius Rufus Two days after was held the election of pretors and this year for the first time six pretors were appointed in consequence of the increase of the provinces and the extension of the bounds of the em pire The persons elected were Lucius Manlius Vulso Caius Sempronius Tuditanus Marcus Sergius Silus Marcus Helvius Marcus Minucius Rufus and Lucius Atilius Of these Sempronius and Helvius were at the time plebeian ediles The curule ediles were Quintus Minucius Thermus and Tiberius Sempronius Longus The Roman games were four times repeated during this year 28 When the new consuls Caius Cornelius and Quintus Minucius entered into office A U C 555 B C 197 the chief business was the adjusting of the HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXXII 389 provinces of the consuls and pretors Those of the pretors were the first settled because that could be done by the lots The city jurisdiction fell to Ser gius the foreign to Minucius Atilius obtained Sar dinia Manlius Sicily Sempronius the Hither Spain and Helvius the Farther When the consuls were preparing to cast lots for Italy and Macedonia Lucius Oppius and Quintus Fulvius plebeian tribunes ob jected to their proceeding alleging that Macedonia was a very distant province and that the principal cause which had hitherto retarded the progress of the war was that when it was scarcely entered on and just at the commencement of operations the former consul was always recalled This was the fourth year since the declaration of war against Macedonia The greater part of one year Sulpicius spent in seeking the king and his army Villius on the point of engaging the enemy was recalled Quintius was detained at Rome for the greater part of his year by business respecting religion nevertheless he had so conducted affairs that had he come earlier into the province or had the cold season been at a greater distance he might have put an end to hostilities He was then just going into winter quarters but by all accounts he had brought the war into such a state that if he were not prevented by a successor there was a reasonable prospect of being able to put an end to it in the course of the ensuing summer By such arguments the tri bunes so far prevailed that the consuls declared that they would abide by the directions of the senate if the cavillers would agree to do the same Both parties having accordingly referred the determination in tirely to those magistrates a decree was passed ap pointing the two consuls to the government of the pro vince of Italy Titus Quintius was continued in com mand until a successor should be found To each two legions were decreed and they were ordered with these to carry on the war with the Cisalpine Gauls who had revolted from the Romans A rein forcement of five thousand foot and three hundred horse 390 LIVY was ordered to be sent into Macedonia to Quintius together with three thousand seamen Lucius Quintius Flamininus was continued in the command of the fleet To each of the pretors for the two Spains were granted eight thousand foot of the allies and Latines and four hundred horse and they were ordered to discharge the veteran troops in their provinces and also to fix the bounds which should divide the hither from the farther province Two additional lieutenants general were sent to the army in Macedonia Publius Sulpicius and Publius Villius who had been consuls in that province 29 It was thought necessary that before the con suls and pretors went abroad some prodigies should be expiated for the temples of Vulcan and Summanus at Rome and a wall and a gate at Fregellas had been struck by lightning At Frusino during the night a light like day shone out At Asculum a lamb was born with two heads and five feet At Formiae two wolves entering the town tore several persons who fell in their way and at Rome a wolf made its way not only into the city but into the capitol Caius Acilius plebeian tribune caused an order to be passed that five colonies should be led out to the sea coast two to the mouths of the rivers Vulturnus and Liternus one to Puteoli and one to the fort of Salernum To these was added Buxentum To each colony three hundred families were ordered to be sent The commissioners appointed to make the settlements who were to hold the office for three years were Marcus Servilius Ge minus Quintus Minucius Thermus and Tiberius Sem pronius Longus As soon as the levies and such other business religious and civil as required their personal attendance was finished the consuls set out for Gaul Cornelius took the direct road towards the Insubrians who were then in arms and had been joined by the Caenomanians Quintus Minucius turned his route to the left side of Italy and leading away his army to i Fluto Summus Manium HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXXII 391 the lower sea to Genoa opened the campaign with an invasion of Lignria Two towns Clastidium and Li tubium both belonging to the Ligurians and two states of the same nation Celela and Cerdicium sur rendered to him And now all the states on this side of the Po except the Boians among the Gauls and the Ilvatians among the Ligurians were reduced to submission no less it is said than fifteen towns and twenty thousand men He then led his legions into the territory of the Boians 30 The Boian army had not very long before crossed the Po and joined the Insubrians and Caeno manians for having heard that the consuls intended to act with their forces united they wished to increase their own strength by this junction But when infor mation reached them that one of the consuls was ra vaging the country of the Boians a dispute instantly arose The Boians demanded that all in conjunction should carry succor to those who were attacked while the Insubrians positively refused to leave their country defenceless In consequence of this dissen sion the armies separated the Boians went to defend their own territory and the Insubrians with the Cae nomanians encamped on the banks of the river Min cius About five miles below this spot the consul Cornelius pitched his camp close to the same river Sending emissaries hence into the villages of the Cae nomanians and Brixia the capital of their tribe he learned with certainty that their young men had taken arms without the approbation of the elders and that the Caenomanians had not joined in the revolt of the Insubrians by any authority from the state On which he invited to him the principal of the natives and endeavored to contrive and concert with them the means of inducing the younger Caenomanians to for sake the party of the Insubrians and either to march away and return home or to come over to the side of the Romans This he was not able to effect but so far he received solemn assurances that in case of a battle they would either stand inactive or 392 livy should any occasion offer would even assist the Ro mans The Insubrians knew not that such an agree ment had been concluded but they harbored in their minds some kind of suspicion that the fidelity of their confederates was wavering Wherefore in forming their troops for battle not daring to intrust either wing to them lest if they should treacherously give ground they might cause a total defeat they placed them in reserve behind the line At the beginning of the fight the consul vowed a temple to Juno Sospita provided the enemy should on that day be routed and driven from the field on which the soldiers raised a shout declaring that they would insure to their commander the completion of his vow and at the same time attacked the enemy The Insubrians did not stand even the first onset Some writers affirm that the Casnomanians falling on their rear during the heat of the engagement caused as much disorder there as prevailed in their front and that thus assailed on both sides thirty five thousand of them ivere slain five thousand seven hundred taken pri soners among whom was Hamilcar a Carthaginian general the original cause of the war and that a hun dred and thirty military standards and above two hun dred waggons were taken On this the towns which had joined in the revolt surrendered to the Romans 31 The other consul Minucius had at first spread his troops through the territories of the Boians com mitting violent depredations every where but after wards when that people left the Insubrians and came home to defend their own property he kept his men within their camp expecting to come to an engage ment with the enemy Nor would the Boians have declined a battle if their spirits had not been de pressed by hearing of the defeat of the Insubrians This so deeply affected them that deserting their commander and their camp they dispersed themselves through the several towns each wishing to take care of his own effects Thus they obliged the enemy to alter their mode of carrying on the war for no lonJ HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXXII 393 ger hoping to decide the matter by a single battle he began again to lay waste the lands burn the houses and storm the villages At this time Clastidium was burned and the legions were led thence against the Ilvatian Ligurians who alone refused to submit That state also on learning that the Insubrians had been defeated in battle and the Boians so terrified that they had not dared to risk an engagement made a submis sion Letters from the consuls containing accounts of their successes came from Gaul to Rome at the same time Marcus Sergius city pretor read them in the senate and afterwards by direction of the Fathers in an assembly of the people on which a supplication of four days continuance was decreed â â By this time winter had begun 32 During the winter while Titus Quintius after the reduction of Elatia had his troops cantoned in Phocis and Locris a violent dissension broke out at Opus One faction invited to their assistance the jEtolians who were nearest at hand the other the Romans The jEtolians arrived first but the other party which was the more powerful refused them ad mittance and despatching a courier to the Roman general held the citadel until he arrived The citadel was possessed by a garrison belonging to the king and they could not be prevailed on to give it up either by the threats of the people of Opus or by the com mands of the Roman consul What prevented their being immediately attacked was the arrival of an en voy from the king to solicit the appointing of a time and place for a conference This request was readily complied with not that Quintius did not wish to see war concluded under his own auspices partly by arms and partly by negotiation for he knew not yet whether one of the new consuls would be sent to take the government in his room or whether he should be continued in the command a point which he had charged his friends and relations to labor with all their might But he thought that a conference would answer this purpose that it would put it in his 394 LI VY power to give matters a turn towards war in case he remained in the province or towards peace if he were to be removed They chose for the meeting a part of the sea shore in the Malian gulf near Nicasa Thi ther Philip came from Demetrias with five barks and one ship of war he was accompanied by some princi pal Macedonians and an Acheean exile named Cycli ades a man of considerable note With the Roman general Were king Amynander Dionysidorus ambas sador from king Attalus Agesimbrotus commander of the Rhodian fleet Phaeneas pretor of the jEtolians and two Achaeans Aristaenus and Xenophon Attended by these the Roman general advanced to the brink of the shore and the king came forward to the prow of his vessel as it lay at anchor when the former said If you will come on the shore we shall converse with greater ease This the king refused and on Quin tius asking him  Whom do you fear With the haughty spirit of royalty he replied Fear I have none but of the immortal gods but I have no confi dence in the faith of those whom I see about you and least of all in the Jitolians â That danger said the Roman  is equal in all cases when men confer with an enemy no confidence subsists â But Titus Quin tius replied the king if treachery be intended the prizes of perfidy are not equal Philip and Phwneas For it will not be so difficult for the jEtolians to find another pretor as for the Macedonians to find another king in my place â Silence then ensued 33 The Roman expected that he who solicited the conference should open it and the king thought that he who was to prescribe not he who received terms of peace ought to begin the conference At length the Roman said that  his discourse should be very simple for he would only mention those articles without which no pacification could be admitted These were that the king should withdraw his garri sons from all the cities of Greece That he should deliver up to the allies of the Roman people the pri soners and deserters should restore to the Romans HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXXII 395 those places in Illyricum of which he had possessed himself by force since the peace concluded in Epirus and to Ptolemy king of Egypt the cities which he had seized since the death of Ptolemy Philopater These were the terms which he required on behalf of himself and the Roman people but it was proper that the demands of the allies also should be heard The ambassador of king Attalus demanded restitution of the ships and prisoners taken in the sea fight at Cius and that Nicephorium and the temple of Venus which Philip had pillaged and defaced should be put in a state of thorough repair The Khodians laid claim to Peraea a tract on the continent lying opposite to their island which from early times had been under their jurisdiction and they required that the garrisons should be withdrawn from Tassus Bargylii and Eu roma and from Sestus and Abydos on the Hellespont that Perinthus should be restored to the Byzantians in right of their ancient title and that all the seaport towns and harbors of Asia should be free The Achseans asserted their right to Corinth and Argos Phasneas nearly repeated the demands made by the Romans that the troops should withdraw out of Greece and the jEtolians be put in possession of the cities which had formerly been under their dominion He was followed by Alexander a man of eminence among this people aud considering his country not uneloquent He said that  he had long kept silence not because he expected that any business would be effected in that conference but because he was unwill ing to interrupt any of the allies in their discourse He asserted that  Philip had neither treated of peace with sincerity nor waged war with courage at any time that in negotiating he was insidious and fraudu lent while in war he never fought on equal ground nor engaged in regular battles but skulking about burned and pillaged towns and when likely to be vanquished destroyed the prizes of victory But not in that manner did the ancient kings of Macedon be have they decided the fate of the war in the field 396 Livv and spared the towns as far as they were able in order to possess the more opulent empire For what sort of conduct was it to destroy the objects for the posses sion of which the contest was waged and thereby leave nothing to himself but fighting Philip had in the last year desolated more cities of his allies in Thessaly than all the enemies that Thessaly ever had On the jEtolians themselves he had made greater de predations when he was in alliance with them than since he became their enemy He had seized on Ly simachia after dislodging the pretor and garrison of the jEtolians Cius also a city belonging to their government he rased from the foundation With the same injustice he held possession of Thebes in Phthi otis of Echinus Larissa and Pharsalus 84 Philip provoked by this discourse of Alexander pushed his ship nearer to the land that he might be the better heard and began to speak with much vio lence particularly against the jEtolians But Phameas interrupting him said that the business depended not on words he must either conquer in war or submit to his superiors â That indeed is evident said Philip even to the blind sneering at Phaeneas who had a disorder in his eyes for he was naturally fonder of such pleasantries than became a king and even in the midst of serious business he indulged a turn to ridicule farther than was decent He then expressed great in dignation at the  Etolians assuming as much import ance as the Romans and insisting on his evacuating Greece people who knew not even its boundaries for of jEtolia itself a large proportion consisting of the Agraeans Apodeotians and Amphilochians was no part of Greece Have they just ground of com plaint against me for not refraining from war with their allies when themselves from the earliest period follow as an established rule the practice of suffering their young men to carry arms against those allies withholding only the public authority of the state while very frequently contending armies have jEtolian auxiliaries on both sides I did not seize on Cius by HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXXII 397 force but assisted my friend and ally Prusias who was besieging it and Lysimachia I rescued from the Thracians But since necessity diverted my attention from the guarding of it to this present war the Thra cians have possession of it So much for the jEtolians To Attalus and the Rhodians I in justice owe nothing for not to me but to themselves is the commencement of hostilities to be attributed However out of respect to the Romans I will restore Perae to the Rhodians and to Attalus his ships and such prisoners as can be found As to what concerns Nicephorium and the temple of Venus what other answer can I make to those who require their restoration than what I should make in case of woods and groves cut down that as the only way of restoring them I will take on myself the trouble and expense of planting since it is thought fit that between kings such kinds of demands should be made and answered The last part of his speech was directed to the Achaeans wherein he enumerated first the kindnesses of Antigonus then his own to wards their nation desiring them to consider the de crees themselves had passed concerning him which comprehended every kind of honor divine and human and to these he added their late decree by which they had confirmed the resolution of deserting him He in veighed bitterly against their perfidy but told them that nevertheless he would give them back Argos With regard to Corinth he would consult with the Roman general and would at the same time inquire from him whether he demanded only that he Philip should evacuate those cities which being captured by himself were held by the right of war or those also which he had received from his ancestors 35 The Achaeans and JEtolians were preparing to answer but as the sun was near setting the conference was adjourned to the next day and Philip returned to his station whence he came the Romans and allies to their camp On the following day Quintius re paired to Nicaea which was the place agreed on at the 398 LIVY appointed time but neither Philip nor any message from him came for several hours At length when they began to despair of his coming his ships sud denly appeared He said that the terms enjoined were so severe and humiliating that not knowing what to determine he had spent the day in deliberation But the general opinion was that he had purposely delayed the business that the Achseans and jEtolians might not have time to answer him and this opinion he himself confirmed by desiring in order to avoid altercation and to bring the affair to some conclusion that the others should retire and leave him to converse with the Roman general for some time this was not admitted lest the allies should appear to be excluded from the conference Afterwards on his persisting in his desire the Roman general with the consent of all taking with him Appius Claudius a military tribune advanced to the brink of the coast and the rest retired The king with the two persons whom he had brought the day before came on shore where they conversed a considerable time in private What account of their proceedings Philip gave to his people is not well known what Quintius told the allies was that  Philip was willing to cede to the Romans the whole coast of Illyricum and to give up the deserters and prisoners if there were any That he consented to restore to Attalus his ships and the seamen taken with them and to the Rhodians the tract which they call Peraea That be refused to evacuate Iassus and Bargylii To the jUtolians he was ready to restore Pharsalus and Larissa Thebes he would keep and that he would give back to the Achasans the possession not only of Argos but of Corinth also This arrangement pleased none of the parties neither those to whom the conces sions were to be made nor those to whom they were refused for on that plan they said  more would be lost than gained nor could the grounds of con tention ever be removed but by his utterly evacuating every part of Greece HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXXII 399 36 These expressions delivered with eagerness and vehemence by every one in the assembly reached the ears of Philip though he stood at a distance He therefore requested of Quintius that the whole business might be deferred until the next day and then he would positively either prevail on the allies to accede to his proposals or suffer himself to be prevailed on to accede to theirs The shore at Thronium was appointed for their meeting and all the parties assembled there early Philip began with intreating Quintius and all who were present not to harbor such sentiments as must tend to obstruct a pacification  and then desired time while he could send ambassadors to Rome to the senate de claring that  he would either obtain a peace on the terms mentioned or would accept whatever terms the senate should prescribe None approved of this they said he only sought a delay and leisure to collect his strength But Quintius observed  that such an ob jection would have been well founded if it were then summer and a season fit for action as matters stood and the winter being just at hand nothing would be lost by allowing him time to send ambassadors for without the authority of the senate no agreement which they might conclude with the king would be valid and besides they would by this means have an oppor tunity while the winter itself would necessarily cause a suspension of arms to learn what terms were likely to be approved by the senate The other chiefs of the allies came over to this opinion and a cessation of hostilities for two months being granted they resolved that each of their states should send an ambassador with the necessary information to the senate and in order that it should not be deceived by the misrepre sentations of Philip To the above contention was added an article that all the king s troops should be immediately withdrawn from Phocis and Locris With the ambassadors of the allies Quintius sent Amynander king of Athamania and to add a degree of splendor to the embassy a deputation from himself composed 400 LIVY of Quintus Fabius the son of bis wife s sister Quintus Fulvius and Appius Claudius 37 On their arrival at Rome the ambassadors of the allies were admitted to audience before those of the king Their discourse in general was filled up with invectives against Philip What produced the greatest effect on the minds of the senate was that by pointing out the relative situations of the lands and seas in that part of the world they made it manifest to every one that if the king held Demetrias in Thessaly Chalcis in Euboea and Corinth in Achaia Greece could not he free and they added that Philip him self with not more insolence than truth used to call these the fetters of Greece The king s ambassadors were then introduced and when they were beginning a long harangue they were stopped by a short ques tion Whether he was willing to yield up the three above mentioned cities They answered that they had received no specific instructions on that head on which they were dismissed without having made any pro gress towards a peace Full authority was given to Quintius to determine every thing relative to war and peace As this demonstrated clearly that the senate were not weary of the war so he who was more earnestly desirous of conquest than of peace never afterwards consented to a conference with Philip and even gave him notice that he would not admit any em bassy from him unless it came with information that his troops were retiring from Greece 38 Philip now perceived that he must decide the matter by arms and collect his strength about him from all quarters Being particularly uneasy in re spect to the cities of Achaia a country so distant from him and also of Argos even more indeed than of Corinth he resolved as the most advisable method to put the former into the hands of Nabis tyrant of Lace daemon in trust as it were on the terms that if he should prove successful in the war Nabis should re deliver it to him if any misfortune should happen he HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXXII 401 should keep it himself Accordingly he wrote to Phi locles who had the command in Corinth and Argos to have a meeting with the tyrant Philocles besides coming with a valuable present added to that pledge Of future friendship between the king and the tyrant that it was Philip s wish to unite his daughters in marriage to the sons of Nabis The tyrant at first refused to receive the city on any other terms than that of being invited by a decree of the Argives them selves but afterwards hearing that in a full assembly they had treated his name not only with scorn but even with abhorrence he thought he had now a suffi cient excuse for plundering them and he accordingly desired Philip to give him possession of the place Nabis was admitted into the city in the night without the privity of any of the inhabitants and at the first light seized on the higher parts of it and shut the gates A few of the principal people having made their escape during the first confusion the properties of all who were absent were seized as booty those who were present were stripped of their gold and silver and loaded with exorbitant contributions Such as paid these readily were discharged without personal insult and laceration of their bodies but such as were suspected of hiding or reserving any of their effects were mangled and tortured like slaves He then sum moned an assembly in which he proposed the passing of two laws one for an abolition of debts the other for a distribution of the land in shares to each manâ two firebrands in the hands of the enemies of govern ment for inflaming the populace against the higher ranks 39 The tyrant when he had the city of Argos in his power never considering from whom or on what con ditions he had received it sent ambassadors to Elatia to Quintius and to Attalus in his winter quarters at jEgina to tell them that  he was in possession of Argos and that if Quintius would come hither and consult with him he had no doubt but that every thing liv vol v 2 c 402 LIVY might be adjusted between them Quintius glad of an opportunity of depriving Philip of that strong hold along with the rest consented to come accord ingly sending a message to Attalus to leave jEgina and meet him at Sicyon he set sail from Anticyra with ten quinqueremes which his brother Lucius Quintius happened to bring a little before from his winter sta tion at Corcyra and passed over to Sicyon Attalus was there before him who representing that the tyrant ought to come to the Roman general not the general to the tyrant brought Quintius over to his opinion which was that he should not enter the city of Argos Not far from it however was a place called Mycenica and there the parties agreed to meet Quintius came with his brother and a few military tribunes Attalus with his royal retinue and Nicostratus the pretor of the Achasans with a few of the auxiliary officers and they there found Nabis waiting with his whole army He advanced armed and attended by his guards almost to the middle of the interjacent plain Quintius unarmed with his brother and two military tribunes the king was accompanied by one of his nobles and the pretor of the Achasans unarmed like wise The tyrant when he saw the king and the Ro man general unarmed opened the conference with apologising for having come to the meeting armed him self and surrounded with armed men He had no apprehensions he said from them but only from the Argive exiles When they then began to treat of the terms on which friendship was to be established be tween them the Roman made two demands one that the Lacedaemonian should conclude a peace with the Achasans the other that he should send him aid against Philip He promised the aid required but instead of a peace with the Achaeans a cessation of hos tilities was obtained to last until the war with Philip should be ended 40 A debate concerning the Argives also was set on foot by king Attalus who charged Nabis with hold HISTORY OF ROME â BOOK XXXII 403 ing their city by force which was put into his hands by the treachery of Philocles while Nabis insisted that he had been invited by the Argives themselves to afford them protection The king required a general assembly of the Argives to be convened that the truth of that matter might be known To this the tyrant did not object but the king alleged that the Lacedaemo nian troops ought to be withdrawn from the city in order to render the assembly free and that the people should be left at liberty to declare their real senti ments This was refused and the debate produced no effect To the Roman general six hundred Cretans were given by Nabis who agreed with the pretor of the Achaeans to a cessation of arms for four months and then the conference broke up Quintius proceeded to Corinth advancing to the gates with the cohort of Cretans in order to show Philocles the governor of the city that the tyrant had deserted the cause of Philip Philocles came out to confer with the Roman general and on the latter exhorting him to change sides immediately and surrender the city he answered in such a manner as showed an inclination rather to defer than to refuse the matter From Corinth Quin tius sailed over to Anticyra and sent his brother thence to sound the disposition of the people of Acarnania Attalus went from Argos to Sicyon Here on one side the state added new honors to those formerly paid to the king and on the other the king besides having on a former occasion redeemed for them at a vast expense a piece of land sacred to Apollo un willing to pass by the city of his friends and allies without a token of munificence made them a present of ten talents of silver i and ten thousand bushels of corn and then returned to Cenchreae to his fleet Nabis leaving a strong garrison at Argos returned to Lacedaemon and as be himself had pillaged the men he sent his wife to Argos to pillage the women She i 19371 10s 404 LIVY invited to her house sometimes singly and sometimes in numbers all the females of distinction who were related to each other
