THE HISTORY OF TACITUS BOOK I I X HE aera from which it is my inten book tion to deduce the following narration is the second consulship of Servius Galba when Titus Vinius was his colleague in office Of the antecedent period inclu ding a space of eight hundred and twenty years a from the foundation of Rome the history has been composed by various authors who as Jong as they had before them the transactions b of the Roman people dignified their work with elo quence equal to the subject and a spirit of freedom worthy of the old republic After the battle of Acfium when to close the O  THE HISTORY book scene of civil distraction all power and authority were surrendered to a single ruler the historic character disappeared and genius died by the same blow that ended public liberty Truth was reduced to the last gasp and various circumstances conspired against her A new constitution took place undefined and little under stood Men resigned their rights and lived like aliens in their native country Adulation began to spread her baneful in fluence and a rooted hatred of their am bitious masters rankled in the breast of numbers Between both parties One pay ing their court and the other brooding over public injuries the care of transmit ting due information to posterity was ut terly lost It is true that against the seductions of the time serving writer you may be upon your guard but on the other hand spleen and calumny are de voured with a greedy ear Flattery wears a badge of servitude while malignity speaks the tone of independance and is therefore well received With regard to the writer of the following work he can with truth aver that Galba Otho and OF TACITUS 7 â 7 Vitellius were neither known to him by marks of favour nor by personal injury The foundation of his fortune c was laid by Vespasian advanced by Titus and carried higher by Doraitian The fact must not be dissembled  but the historian who enters on his office with a profession of integrity must not desert the cause of truth No character should be touched with partiality  none should be disfigured by passion or resentment Of Nerva and Trajan d if my health continues it is my design to compose the history it is a favourite plan rich in materials and every way safe I have reserved it for the evening of my days  a glorious period  in which through the rare felicity of the times a man may think with freedom and what he thinks he may publish to the world II The subject now before me presents a series of great events and battles fierce and bloody a portion of time big with intestine divisions and even the intervals of peace deformed with cruelty and horror the whole a tragic volume displaying in succession four princes a put to death 8 THE HISTORY book three civil wars b with foreign enemies a greater number and in some conjunc tures both depending at once prosperity in the East disasters in the West Illyri cum thrown into convulsions both the Gauls on the eve of a revolt Britain c conquered and in the moment of con quest lost again the Sarmatians and the Suevians d leagued against the Romans the Dacian name ennobled by alternate victory and defeat and finally the Par thians taking the field under the banners of a pretended Nero e In the course of the work we shall see Italy over whelmed with calamities new wounds inflicted and the old which time had closed opened again and bleeding afresh cities sacked by the enemy or swallowed up by earthquakes  and the fertile country of Campania made a scene of de solation Rome laid waste by fire her antient and most venerable temples smok ing on the ground  the capitol g wrapt in flames by the hands of frantic citizens  the holy ceremonies of religion violated adultery reigning without controul the adjacent islands filled with exiles rocks OP TACITUS 9 and desert places stained with clandestine book i murder and Rome itself a theatre of hor ror where nobility of descent and splen dour of fortune marked men out for de struction  where the vigour of mind that aimed at civil dignities and the modesty that declined them were offences without distinction where virtue was a crime that led to certain ruin where the guilt of in formers and the wages of their iniquity were alike detestable where the sacer dotal order the consular dignity the go vernment of provinces A and even the cabinet of the prince were seized by that execrable race as their lawful prey where nothing was sacred nothing safe from the hand of rapacity where slaves were sub orned or by their own malevolence ex cited against their masters  where freed men betrayed their patrons and he who had lived without an enemy i 9 died by the treachery of a friend III ANB yet this melancholy period barren as it was of public virtue produced some examples of truth and honour Mo thers went with their sons into voluntary 10 THE HISTORY book exile wives followed the fortune of their husbands relations stood forth in the cause of their unhappy khidred  sons ap peared in defence of their fathers  slaves on the rack gave proofs of their fidelity eminent citizens under the hard hand of oppression were reduced to want and misery and even in that distress re tained an unconquered spirit We shall see others firm to the last and in their deaths nothing inferior to the ap plauded characters of antiquity In ad dition to the misfortunes usual in the course of human transactions we shall see the earth teeming with prodigies the sky overcast with omens thunder rolling with dreadful denunciation and a variety of prognostics sometimes auspicious often big with terror occasionally uncertain dark equivocal frequently direct and manifest In a word the gods never gave such terrible instructions nor by the slaughter of armies made it so clear and evident that instead of extending pro tection a to the empire it was their awful pleasure to let fall their vengeance on the crimes of an offending people  OF TACITUS 11 IV Before we take up the thread of book i our narrative it will nut be useless to en quire what in that period was the state of affairs at Rome and what the spirit that went forth among her armies how the provinces stood affected and wherein con sisted the strength or weakness of the em pire By proceeding in this manner we shall not content ourselves with a bare recital of facts which are often ascribed to chance  we shall see the spring of each transaction and a regular chain of causes and effects will be laid open to our view The death of Nero in the first tumult of emotion was considered as a public blessing but the senate the people of Rome the praetorian guards and the le gions wherever stationed were variously affected by that event A new political secret was then for the first time discovered It was perceived that elsewhere than at Rome an emperor might be invested with the sovereign power rJhe fathers seized the opportunity during the absence of a prince yet new a to the reins of govern ment to exercise their antient rights 1 THE HISTORY book pleased with the novelty of freedom and the resumption of their legislative autho rity The Roman knights caught the flame of liberty Honest men began to entertain hopes of the constitution Such as stood connected with families of credit and the various clients and freedmen of illustrious men driven into exile were all erect with expectation of better times The inferior populace who loitered away their time in the theatre and the circus the slaves of abandoned characters and the sycophant crew who without sub stance of their own had been pampered by the vices of Nero  all of that descrip tion stood covered with astonishment yet panting for news and eagerly swallowing the rumour of the day V The praetorian guards a had been by habit and the obligation of their oath always devoted to the imperial family Their revolt from Nero was not so much their own inclination as the management of their leaders Acting without principle they now were ready for new commotions The promise of a donative in the name of 6 OP TACITUS l 13 Galba was still to be performed They book knew that war is the soldier s harvest â â A U C Peace affords no opportunity to gain the 822 recompense due to valour and the favours a of the new prince would be engrossed by the legions to whom he owed his eleva tion Fired by these reflections and fur ther instigated by the arts of Nymphidius Sabinus b their commanding officer whose ambition aimed at the imperial dignity they began to meditate a second revolution The conspiracy was crushed in the bud and Nymphidius perished in the attempt But the soldiers had thrown off the mask and the sense of guilt served only to goad and spur their resolution They talked of Galba with contempt and ridicule they laughed at his advanced age they inveighed against his avarice and the rigorous discipline c by which he had acquired his military character inflamed the prejudices of men who had been enervated by a long peace of fourteen years During that time the dissolute manners of Nero diffused a general 14 THE HISTORY book corruption insomuch that the virtues which formerly gained the affection of the army were fallen into contempt Nero was endeared to the soldiers by his vices dalba on the contrary was rendered un popular by the austerity of his manners He was used to say that he chose his sol diers but never bought them The maxim was worthy of the old republic but no man thought it an effusion from the heart His conduct and his words were too much at variance VI Galba being now in the decline of life resigned himself altogether to Titus Vinius a and Cornelius Laco the former the most profligate of men and the latter despised for his sluggish inactivity By those pernicious ministers he was in volved in the popular hatred due to their own flagitious deeds The wickedness of Vinius and the incapacity of Laco proved his ruin in the end He made his approach to Rome b by slow journeys in his pro gress marking his way with blood and cruelty Cingonius Varro consul elect ajad Petronius Turpilianus of consular 3 OF TACITUS 15 rank were by his orders put to death book the former as an accomplice in the enter prise of Nymphidius and the latter be cause he had been appointed to command the army under Nero Thpy were con demned unheard and for that reason thought the innocent victims of a bar barous policy Galba s entry c into the city of Rome after the massacre of several thousands of unarmed and defenceless soldiers struck a general panic The people at large were thrown into consternation and even the men who executed the orders of their ge neral stood astonished at the horrors of the scene Rome at that time was filled with a prodigious body of troops assem bled from various parts of the empire Be sides the forces drawn from the fleet c and left as a garrison by Nero Galbu when he entered the city brought with him a legion from Spain To these must be added the e several companies from Germany from Britain and lllyricum which had been sent forward towards the Caspian streights  to serve in the war 16 THE HISTORY book then intended against the Albanians In a short time afterwards on the first notice of the revolt excited in Gaul by the tur bulent genius of Vindex g they were all recalled  and the consequence was that Rome saw within her walls the unusual spectacle of a vast military force In so large a number of soldiers not yet de voted to the interest of a single leader the seed plots of a new rebellion were prepared and ready to break out on the first alarm VII It happened at this point of time that an account arrived of two murders committed at a distance from Rome one of Clodius Macer in Africa and the other of Fonteius Capito a in Germany Ma cer beyond all doubt was engaged in schemes of ambition and in the midst of his projects was cut off by Trebonius Gar rucianus the procurator of the province who had received his orders from Galba Capito was put to death by Cornelius Aquinus and Fabius Valens on a like sus picion of plotting innovations in the state But the charge against him was by no DP TACITUS 17 means clear nor had the emperor issued book his orders The general opinion was that Capito howeveT branded with avarice rapacity and other vices had not added to his crimes the guilt of rebellion but that the authors of his destruction having first endeavoured to draw him into their own designs combined to execute on an innocent victim the vengeance due to their own iniquity Galba with his usual facility or per haps wishing to avoid the danger of an inquiry into what could not be recalled thought it prudent to give his sanction to the acts of his officers however unjust and cruel Both executions were notwith standing the subject of public clamour the usual fate of all unpopular princes  their actions when the current of the times is set against them are taken in the gross and whether good or evil con demned without distinction Venality and corruption were now fully established The emperor s freedmen engrossed the whole power of the state and every thing was put up to sale Even the slaves in vot v c 18 v   â THE HISTORY   book haste to grow rich and fearing the uncer tainty of an old man s life began to seize their share of the plunder The new court opened with all the vices of Nero s reign but without the same apology The ad vanced age b of Galba was a subject of ridicule Dissipation at his time of life excited laughter and contempt Appear ances are the reasons of the populace  they were accustomed to the youthful fro lics of Nero and in their comparison of princes elegance of figure and the graces of deportment are decisive qualities VIII Such was the posture of affairs at Rome and such the sentiments that per vaded the mass of the people With re gard to the provinces Spain was governed by Cluvius Rufus a a man distinguished by his eloquence and well accomplished in the arts of peace but of no reputation in war In both the Gauls the name of Vindex was still held in veneration and the people pleased with their recent ad mission to the freedom b of Rome and the diminution of their tribute showed no symptoms of disaffection In those parts 7 OF TACITUS i S   however which lay contiguous to the bo German armies the inhabitants of the several cities saw with discontent that they were not thought worthy of the like indulgence Some of them complained that their territories were circumscribed within narrower limits and in vulgar minds the good extended to others was an aggravation of the injury done to them selves â â The legions in Germany did not show a countenance that promised a perfect calm The restless temper of the soldiers by their late victory c flushed with pride yet dreading the imputation of having conquered Galba s party was thrown into violent agitations by turns inflamed with rage and overwhelmed with fear From such a number of soldiers who had the power of the sword in their own hands nothing but danger was to be appre hended They balanced for some time before they detached themselves from Nero nor did Verginius their command ing officer declare immediately for Galba Whether that tardy movement was occa  c2 20 THE HISTORY book sioned by his own ambitious projects can not now be known The soldiers it is certain made him a tender of the imperial dignity The death of Fonteius Capito was another cause of discontent Even such as could not deny the justice of the measure exclaimed against it with indig nation While the minds of men were thus distracted with contending passions Galba thought fit under a show of friend ship to recall Verginius d from his post The legions had now no chief at their head and if the conduct of their general was arraigned they considered themselves as men involved in the same accusation IX The legions on the Upper Rhine were ill retained in their duty by Hordeo nius Flaccus an officer far advanced in years without vigour of mind disabled in his limbs and by his infirmities exposing himself and old age to scorn Unequal to the command even in quiet times he was now in a camp full of bold and tur bulent spirits unable to support his au thority His endeavours to enforce obe dience served only to irritate the minds of OF TACITUS 21 men disposed to mutiny On the Lower book Rhine the army had been for some time without a general of consular rank till Aulus Vitellius a son of the person of that name who had been censor and three times consul was sent by Galba to take upon him the command This to Galba seemed sufficient and the Fates b pr dained it In Britain every thing was quiet The legions stationed in that island had no party divisions to distract them During the civil wars that followed they took no part in the contest Situated at a distance and divided by the ocean from the rest of the world they did not catch the epi demic phrensy of the times They knew no enemies but those of their country and  were not taught by civil discord to hate one another Illyricum remained in a state of tranquillity though the legions drawn by Nero from that country found the means while they loitered in Italy of tampering with Verginius But the armies were at distant stations separated by a long tract of sea or land and that cir 22 THE HISTORY book cumstance proved the best expedient to prevent a combination of the military They could neither act with a spirit of uniOn nor by communicating their vices spread a general infection through the legions that lay remote from each other X The East was hitherto free from commotion Licinius Mucianus govern ed the province of Syria with four le gions under his command He was an officer of experience distinguished in the early parts of his life by alternate vicissi tudes of good and evil fortune In his youth the favour of the great was the ob ject of his ambition and in that pursuit he wasted his fortune His circumstances growing desperate and a storm impending from the displeasure of Claudius he re tired into Asia and there lived in obscu rity as little removed from the state and condition of a real exile as he was after wards from the splendour of imperial for tune He united in his character a rare and wonderful mixture of repugnant qua lities He was affable and arrogant ad dicted to pleasure and by fits and starts OF TACITUS 23 a man of business When at leisure from book affairs he gave a loose to his luxurious passions if his interest required it he came upon mankind with superior talents The minister was praised and the private man detested The art of conciliating the good will of others was his in an eminent degree With his inferiors he knew how to soften authority to his friends and equals his address was courtly and yet with these attractive arts a man so va rious was fitter to raise others to the impe rial dignity than to obtain it for himself The Avar against the Jews had been committed by Nero to Flavius Vespasian who was then in Judaea at the head of three legions That commander had formed no design nor even a wish against the interest of Galba He sent his son Titus to Rome as will be seen hereaf ter a with congratulations to Galba and assurances of fidelity It was not then perceived that the sovereign power was destined by the decrees of Heaven for Vespasian and his two sons After his accession portents and prodigies and the 24 THT3 HISTORY book responses of oracles were better under stood XL Mgyvt and the forces stationed there to bridle the several provinces were according to the system established by Augustus confided to the Roman knights who exercised all the powers of the an tient kings In order to keep in subjec tion a country difficult of access and at the same time a granary of corn where the genius of the people a deeply tinged with superstition was ever wavering and prone to change where there was no plan of regular government and by consequence no respect paid to the civil magistrate it was the policy of Augustus to retain the administration like a mystery of state in his own hands and under his own cabinet council In the present juncture b Ti berius Alexander a native of the country was intrusted with the government of the province Africa and the legions quartered there were since the murder of Clodius Macer grown indifferent to all modes of govern  OF TACITUS 25 meat Having experienced the authority book of an inferior master they were willing to submit to any prince The two Maurita nia c Raetia Noricum and Thrace with the places committed to the care of impe rial procurators had no fixed principle no hatred and no affection but what was inspired by the force nearest at hand They were always united in opinion with the strongest The provinces which were left naked and defenceless and Italy in particular were open to the first invader the ready prey of any conqueror Such was the situation of the Roman world when Servius Galba in his second consul ship and Titus Vinius his colleague began their year a fatal year which brought them both to a tragic catastrophe and the commonwealth to the brink of ruin XII In a few days after the calends of January letters arrived at Rome from Pompeius Propinquus the procurator of Belgic Gaul a with intelligence of a re volt in Upper Germany The legions in that quarter disregarding the obligation of their oath shook off all obedience and 2G THE HISTORY book demanded another emperor willing how ever to soften the violence of their pro ceedings and for that purpose to leave the choice to the judgment of the senate and the Roman people The use that Galba made of this intelligence was to hasten the adoption of a successor a point which he had for some time revolved in his mind and often discussed with his secret advisers During the few months of his reign no subject had so much en grossed the public conversation The people alwavs politicians and fond of settling state affairs gave a loose to their usual freedom of speech and besides an emperor on the verge of life made it na tural to advert to the succession Few were able to think Avith judgment and fewer had the virtue to feel for the public good Private views and party connec tions suggested various candidates Dif ferent factions were formed and all in trigued caballed and clamoured as their hopes or fears directed Titus Vinius did not escape the notice of the public He grew in power every day and the hatred of the people kept pace with his rising OF TACITWS 27 grandeur In the sudden elevation of Galba this man and his adherents with all the creatures of the court saw their oppor tunity to enrich themselves with the spoils of their country and encouraged as they were by the facility of a weak a credu lous and superannuated prince they were resolved to lose no time In such a pe riod the temptation was great and guilt might hope to plunder with impunity XIII The whole sovereign power was in the hands of Titus Vinius the consul and Cornelius Laco the proefetl of the praetorian gutwds A third favourite soon appeared on the political stage with a de gree of influence not inferior to either of the former The name of this man was Icelus a one of the emperor s freedmen lately created a Roman knight and to suit his new dignity honoured with the name of Martianus The three confiden tial ministers were soon at variance They clashed in interest and in all inferior transactions drew different ways  but in the choice of a successor tbey were di vided into two factions Vinius declared 28 THE HISTORY book for Marcus Otho  Laco and Icelus joined in opposition to that measure not so much to favour a friend of their own as to thwart the designs of a rival Galba was not to learn the close connection that subsisted between Vinius and Otho The busy politicians who love to pry into every thing and divulge all they know and all they think had circulated a report that reached the ear of the emperor Vi nius had a daughter at that time a widow Otho was unmarried and a match between them would make the minister the father in law of his future emperor Galba resolved to act with caution and with due regard to the public welfare He saw the sovereign power wrested out of the hands of Nero but wrested iis vain if transferred to a man like Otho a stranger from his earliest days to every fair pursuit and iii the prime of manhood distinguished by nothing but riot and de bauchery It was his taste for luxury and vicious pleasures that first recommended him to the notice of Nero He vied with his master in all kinds of dissipation and OF TACITUS 29 in consequence of that connection be came the worthy depositary to whom the prince intrusted the care of his dearly be loved Poppaea 6 till such time as Octavia was by a divorce removed out of the way But Qtho s fidelity soon became suspect ed Nero s jealousy could not bear a rival He sent his favourite companion to govern the province of Lusitania and under that pretext banished him from Rome It is true that Otho in the course of his administration gained by his mild and courtly manners no small degree of popularity In the late revolution he Was the first to espouse the interest of Galba While the war lasted he conti nued an active partisan and by his splen did appearance did no small credit to the Cause Hence his hopes of being called to the succession The soldiers favoured his pretensions and the creatures of Nero s court promised themselves under a sove reign so nearly resembling their master a return of the same vices XIV Galba saw with deep anxiety a 30 THE HISTORY book storm gathering in Germany and where it would burst he could not foresee Of Vi tellius and his designs no certain account arrived The revolt of the legions filled him with apprehensions and he reposed no confidence in the praetorian guards The nomination of a successor seemed in such a crisis to be the best expedient and for that purpose he held a cabinet council Besides Vinius and Laco he thought proper to summon Marius Celsus consul elect and Ducennius Geminus the praefect of the city Having prefaced the business in a short speech concerning his age and infirmities he sent for Piso Lici nianus a whether of his own free choice or at the instigation of Laco remains uncertain That minister had lived in friendship with Piso He contracted an intimacy with him at the house of Rubel lius Plautus though he had now the ad dress to conceal that connection affecting with public motives to recommend a stranger To this conduct the fair es teem in which Piso was held gave an appearance of sincerity Piso was the OF TACITUS 31 son of Marcus Crassus and Scribonia book both of illustrious descent His aspect was grave and his deportment formal such as gave an idea of primitive man ners By the candid aiid impartial he was called strict and severe by his ene mies morose and sullen With great ex cellencies he had a mixture of those qua lities that are often the shades of eminent virtue but those very shades which seemed to others too dark and gloomy in the eyes of Galba were the strokes of cha racter that gave Piso a cast of antiquity and made him worthy to be the adopted heir to the empire XV Galba we are told taking Piso by the hand addressed him in the follow ing manner  If the adoption which I  am now to make were like the act of a  private citizen to be acknowledged as  the law Curiata a directs in the pre  sence of the pontiffs I should derive  honoui to myself from an alliance with  a person descended from the great  Pompey and Marcus Crassus and in  return you would add to the nobility of 32 THE HISTORY book Â your own family the lustre of the Sul pician and Lutatian name I now ad dress you in a more exalted character It is the emperor of Rome that speaks  Called by the consent of gods and men  to that high station I am now deter  mined in my choice by your rare ac  complishments and the love I feel for  my country I invite you to the impe  rial dignity  that dignity for which our  ancestors led armies to the field and  which I myself obtained in battle  Without your stir I now make to you a  voluntary offer For this proceeding I  have before me the example of Augus  tus who associated to himself first his  sister s son Marcellus and then Agrippa  his son in law his grandsons afterwards  and finally Tiberius the son of his  wife Augustus indeed looked for an  heir in his own family I choose in the  bosom of the commonwealth If upon  such an occasion I could listen to pri  vate affection I have a numerous train  of relations and I have companions in  war But it was not from motives of  pride that I accepted the sovereignty of OF TACITUS S3  the state  ambition had no share in my book  conduct I brought with me to the  seat of government an upright inten  tion and that I now act on the same  principle may be fairly seen when in  my present choice I postpone not only  my own relations but even those of  your own family You have a brother  in point of nobility your equal by  priority of birth your superior and  if your merit did not supersede him  a man worthy of the highest eleva  tion  You are now at the time of life at  which the passions subside Your for  mer conduct requires no apology For  tune has hitherto b frowned upon you   you must now beware of her smiles  Prosperity tries the human heart with  the deepest probe and draws forth the  hidden character We struggle with  adversity but success disarms us I  trust however that you will carry  with you to the highest station the  candour of your mind your good faithj  your independent spirit and your con  stancy in friendship virtues that exalt vot v D 34 THE HISTORY book  and dignify the human character but the arts of insidious men will lay siege to your best qualities and undermine  them all Dissimulation will deceive  you flattery will find admission to your  heart and self interest the bane of all  true affection will lay snares to seduce  your integrity To day you and I con  verse without disguise in terms of plain  simplicity how will others deal with  us  Their respect will be paid to our  fortunes not to ourselves To talk the  language of sincerity to a prince and  guide him by honest counsels is a labo  rious task to play the hypocrite re  quires no more than to humour his in  clinations whatever they are It is the  grimace of friendship  the heart has no  share in the business XVI If the mighty fabric of this  great empire could subsist on any other  foundation than that of a monarchy  the glory of restoring the old republic  should this day be mine But at my  age all that remains for me is to be  queath to the people an able successor  your youth may give them a virtuous OF TACITUS 35 prince Under Tiberius Caligula and book Claudius we were all the property ofvâ vâ one family By hereditary right the 822 Roman world was theirs The prince 69 is now elective and the freedom of choice is liberty The Julian and the Claudian race are both extinct and virtue may now succeed by adoption To be born the son of a prince is the result of chance mankind con sider it in no higher light The method of adoption allows time to deliberate and the public voice will serve as a guide to direct the judgment of the emperor Let Nero be for ever before your eyes proud of his long line of ancestors and warm with the blood of the Caesars he did not fall by the re volt of Vindex at the head of a pro vince naked and disarmed nor was he deposed by me who had only one legion under my command his own vices his own cruelty hurled him from his throne no more to trample on the necks of mankind Of a prince con demned by a public sentence there was till then no example s d 2 36 THE HISTORY  As to myself raised as I was by the  events Of war and called to the so  vereignty by the voice of a willing peo  pie I know what I have to expect  envy and malice may pursue me but  the glory of doing good shall still be  mine After the storm that lately shook  the empire you will not wonder that a  perfect calm has not succeeded  and if  two legions waver in their duty your  courage must not be disconcerted My  reign did not begin in the halcyon days  of peace Old age at present is the  objection urged against me but when  it is known whom I have adopted I shall  appear young in my successor Nero is  still regretted by the vile and profligate  that good men may not regret him it  will be ours to provide by our future  conduct More than I have said the  time will not admit if I have made a  proper choice I have discharged my  duty One rule however there is wor  thy of your consideration In all ques  tions of good and evil ask yourself  when you was a subject what did you  expect from the prince and what did OF TACITUS 37 you wish him to avoid It is not at book  Rome as in despotic governments  where one family towers above mankind  and their subjects groan in bondage  You are to reign over the Roman pco  pie a people whom no extreme will  suit when in full possession of liberty  enemies to their own happiness when  reduced to slavery impatient of the  yoke To this effect Galba delivered  himself little doubting but that he was then creating a prince the courtiers con sidered it as a complete legal act and paid their homage to their future so vereign XVII During the whole of this solemn transaction Piso we are told never lost the even tenor of his mind From the first moment all eyes were fixed upon him yet on his part no emotion was seen no symptom of joy no surprise no confusion He addressed the emperor now his father in terms of profound respect and spoke of himself with reserve and modesty His mien and countenance never betrayed the smallest inward alteration He behaved 38  THE HISTORY book with the apathy of a man who deserved to reign but did not desire it The next con sideration was in what place the adoption should be announced in the forum before an assembly of the people in the senate or in the camp The latter was thought most eligible the army would feel the com pliment the affections of the soldiers though of little value if purchased by bribery and low intrigue are notwith standing when they are gained by fair and honourable means always of moment and never to be neglected Meanwhile the populace rushing in crowds from every quarter surrounded the palace burning with impatience for the important news and growing still more eager in propor tion to the delay of the profound poli ticians who affected an air of mystery when the secret had already transpired XVIII On the fourth of the ides of January the weather was uncommonly tempestuous accompanied with heavy rains thunder and lightning and all the uproar of the elements which usually alarms the superstition of the multitude OF TACITUS S9 In antient times this phenomenon would book have been sufficient a to dissolve all pub lic assemblies but Galba was not to be deterred from his purpose He proceeded to the camp regardless of prodigies which he considered as the effect of natural causes or it may be that what is fixed by fate cannot by human prudence be avoided A vast conflux of soldiers as sembled in the camp Galba addressed them in a short speech such as becomes the imperial dignity He told them that in conformity to the example of Augustus and the practice of the army where each soldier chooses his companion in war b he bad adopted Piso for his son Fearing that his silence on the subject of the Ger man revolt might tend to magnify the danger he added that the fourth and eighteenth legions were by the artifice of a few factious leaders incited to tumult and disorder but their violence went no further than words and he had no doubt but they would soon be sensible of their error Such was his plain and manly lan guage He added no flattering expressions no soothing hopes of a donative The 40 THE HISTORY book tribunes notwithstanding and the cen turions and soldiers who stood nearest to his person raised a shout of approbation Through the rest of the lines a deep and sullen silence prevailed The men saw with discontent that on the eve of a war they Avere deprived of those gratuities which had been granted in time of peace and were now become the soldier s right The emperor beyond all doubt had it in his power to secure the affections of the soldiers From a parsimonious old man the smallest mark of liberality would have made an impression But in an age that could no longer bear the virtues of the old republic rigid oeconomy was out of sea son and by consequence the worst of policy XIX From the camp Galba proceeded to the senate His speech like that to the soldiers was short unadorned and simple Piso delivered himself with grace and eloquence The fathers heard him with attention some with real affection and others who in their hearts opposed his interest with overacted zeal while OF TACITUS 4t the neutral and indifferent by for the greatest number made a tender of their services all with private views regardless of their country This was the only pub lic act in which Piso appeared In the time that followed between his adoption and his death an interval of four days he neither said nor did any thing that merits the attention of history Affairs in Germany began to wear a gloomy aspect Messengers uppn the heels of one another came posting to Rome  and in a city where men stood athirst for news and swallowed the worst with avidity nothing was seen but hurry and confusion The fathers resolved to treat by their deputies with the German legions In a secret council it was pro posed that Piso should set out at the head of the embassy that the army might have before their eyes the authority of the senate and the majesty of the empire It was further thought advisable that Laco the praefect of the praetorian guards should accompany the deputation but he declined the office Nor was the choice 3 42 THE HISTORY book of the ambassadors easily arranged  The vâ sâ whole was left to G albas judgment and 822 he executed it with caprice and shameful A I 69 indecision Men were appointed and re moved  others were substituted and changed again some excused themselves numbers as fear or ambition prompted made interest for the preference or for permission to remain at home XX The means of raising money came next under consideration A7arious expe dients were proposed but none appeared so just as that of making reprisals on such as by their rapacity impoverished the com monwealth Nero had lavished in pensions and donations above two and twenty mil lion of sesterces The men who had en riched themselves by this wild profusion were allowed to retain a tenth part a of  the plunder and condemned to refund the rest But their tenth part was no longer in their possession Prodigal no less of the public money than of their own they had squandered all in riot and de bauchery They had neither landsj nor funds of any kind The wreck of their OF TACITUS 43 fortunes consisted of little more than the book utensils of luxury vice and folly To en â â force a resumption of all enormous grants sm 1 n A IX a court of commissioners was established Â Â consisting of thirty Human knights This tribunal odious on account of its novelty and still more so for its number of officers and the spirit of cabal that prevailed in every part of the business was found vexa tious and oppressive The auctioneer planted his staff in every street the pub lic crier was heard sales and confiscations were seen a general ferment spread through the city And yet this scene of distress was beheld with pleasure The men who had been pillaged by Nero saw the minions of that emperor reduced to a level with themselves About the same time several tribunes were discharged from the service In that number were An toniusTaurus and Antonius Naso both of the praetorian guards  vEmilius Pacensis from the city cohorts and Julius Fronto from the night watch But this so far from being a remedy served only to alarm and irritate the rest of the officers They concluded that all were equally suspected 44 THE HISTORY book and that a timid court not daring at once to go the length of its resentment would proceed to cull them out man by man XXI Otho in the mean time felt every motive that could inflame ambition In quiet times he had nothing before him but despair trouble and confusion were his only source of hope His luxury was too great for the revenue of a prince a and his fortune was sunk to the lowest ebb below the condition of a private man He hated Galba and he saw Piso with an eye of envy To these incentives he added real or imaginary fears for his own personal safety and in those fears he found new motives for rebellion  He had felt the  weight of Nero s displeasure and must  he now wait for a second Lusitania  Was he to expect under colour of  friendship another honourable banish  ment The man whom the public voice  has named for the succession is sure  to be suspected by the reigning prince  It was that jealousy that ruined his in  terest with a superannuated emperor  and the same narrow motive would act OP TACITUS 45 K with greater force on the mind of a book  young man 6 by nature harsh and in  his exile grown fierce and savage Otho  was perhaps already doomed to de  struction But the authority of CJalba  was on the decline and that of Piso not  yet established This was therefore  the time to strike a sudden blow The  convulsion of states and the change  of masters afford the true season for  courage and vigorous enterprise In  such a period when inactivity is certain  ruin and bold temerity may be crowned  with success to linger in doubt might  be the ruin of his cause To die is the  common lot of humanity In the grave  the only distinction lies between those  who leave no trace behind and the he  roic spirits who transmit their nam u to posterity And since the same end  awaits alike the guilty and the innocent  the man of enterprise will provoke his  fate and close the scene with glory XXII The mind of Otho was not like his body a soft and effeminate His slaves and freed men lived in a course of 46 THE HISTORY book luxury unknown to private families They nattered their master s taste they painted to him in lively colours the joys of Nero s court and the perpetual round of gay delights in which he had passed his days they represented to him adultery without control the choice of wives and concubines and scenes of revelry scarce ly known to Asiatic princes These if he dared nobly they represented to him as his own  if he remained inactive as the prize of others The judicial astrologers added a spur to inflame his ardour They announced great events and to Otho a year of glory Society has perhaps never known a more dangerous pest than this race of impostors who have been ever ready with vile infusions to poison the hearts of princes and to stimulate am bition to its ruin  a set of perfidious men proscribed by law and yet in defiance of all law cherished in such a city as Rome It was with this crew of fortune tellers that Poppaea held consultations when she aspired to the imperial bed It happened that one of these pretenders to praeterna OT TACITUS 47 tural knowledge a man of the name of book Ptolemy accompanied Otho into Spain He had there foretold that Otho would survive the reign of Nero and the event giving credit to his art he took upon him to promise greater things He saw Galba on the verge of life and Otho in the vigour of his days From that circum stance and the currents of popular rumour that filled the city of Rome this man drew his conjectures and ventured to announce Otho s elevation to the imperial dignity These bodings were welcome to the ear of Otho  he considered them as the effect of science and believed the whole with that credulity which in a mind intiamed with ambition stands ready to receive the mar vellous for reality From this time Pto lemy was the chief actor in the dark scenes that followed He inspired the plan of treason and Otho embraced it with impetuous ardour The heart that has formed the wish and conceived the project has seldom any scruple about the means XXIII Whether this bold conspiracy 8 48 THE HISTORY book was then first imagined or prepared and settled long before cannot now be known It is however certain that Otho had been in the habit of courting the affections of the army and this either with a view of being called to the succession or if not with a design to seize it by force He omitted no opportunity to ingratiate him self with the common men on their march in the lines at their quarters he made it his business to converse freely with all he accosted the veterans by name andr re membering their service under Nero called them his brother soldiers he re newed his acquaintance with some he inquired after others and with his interest and his purse was ready to be their friend In these discourses he took care to mingle complaints and with half hinted malig nity to glance at Galba He omitted nothing that could fill the vulgar mind with discontent The soldiers were pre pared to receive the worst impressions Fatiguing marches provisions ill supplied and a plan of rigorous discipline lately revived turned their hearts against the reigning prince They had known gentler OF TACITUS 49 times when at their ease they traversed book the lakes of Campania and went on sail ing parties to the cities of Achaia but now the scene was changed to the Alps the Pyreneans and long tracts of country where they were to march under a load of armour scarce supportable XXIV While the minds of the sol diers were by these means thrown into vio lent agitations Maevius Pudens a near re lation of Tigellinus added fuel to the flame Whoever was known to be of a light and versatile disposition in distress for money or fond of public commotions this man attracted to his party He sapped his way with a degree of dexterity as un perceived as it was successful As often as Galba was entertained at Otho s house he distributed to the cohort on duty a hundred sesterces for every man under colour of an allowance for their usual con vivial party This generosity which pass ed under the name of a largess was in creased by the secret but well applied bribery of Otho who became at last a corruptor so bold and open that when vol v E 50 THE HISTORY Cocceius Proculus a soldier of the body guard was engaged in a litigation with one of his neighbours about the boundaries of their respective grounds Otho bought the whole estate of the adverse party and conveyed it to the soldier as a present And yet these practices gave no jealousy to the commander of the praetorian bands To penetrate dark transactions was so far from being his talent that he could not see what escaped no eye but his own   XXV Otho took into his councils one of his freedmen by name Onomastus This man was chosen to conduct the en terprise He selected for his accomplices Barbius Proculus whose duty it was to bear the watch word to the night guar d and one Veturius his chosen assistant Otho sounded them apart and finding them fit instruments for his purposes subtle dark and resolute he loaded theuj both with presents and dismissed th D with a sum of money to be employed i bribing  the rest of the guards In thjÂ manneij two soldiers undertook to dispose aÂ Â hc ojÂ an empire and whaMhex un OP TACITUS 51 dertook they dared to execute A few book only were conscious of the plot The rest though held in suspense were managed with such dexterity that they stood in readiness as soon as the blow was struck to second the conspirators The soldiers of note were told that having been di stinguished by Nymphidius they lived in danger suspected and exposed to the resentment of Galba The loss of the donative so often promised and still withheld was the topic enforced to ir ritate the minds of the common men Numbers lamented the loss of Nero and the agreeable vices of that dissolute reign All were averse from the new plan of dis cipline and the idea of a further reform diffused a general terror XXVI The spirit of disaffection spread as it were by contagion to the legions and the auxiliary troops all sufficiently agitated by the revolt in Germany The vile and profligate were ready for any mis chief and among the few of sober con duct inactivity was no better than treason in disguise The conspirators saw their i E 2 52 THE HISTORY advantage insomuch that on the day ensuing the ides of January they formed a resolution to take Otho under their care as he returned from supper and with out further delay proclaim him emperor This project however did not take effect In the darkness of the night and the con fusion inseparable from it no man could answer for the consequences The city was full of soldiers and among men in flamed with liquor no union no con certed measure could be expected The traitors desisted from their purpose but with no public motive The general wel fare made no impression on men who had conspired to imbrue their hands in the blood of their sovereign What they chiefly feared was that the first who offered himself to the troops from Ger many and Pannonia might by those strangers and in the tumult of the dark be mistaken for Otho and saluted by the title of emperor The plot thus checked for the present began to transpire and must have been by various circumstances brought to light had not the chief con spirators laboured to suppress all appear OF TACITUS 53 ances of lurking treason Some facts book however reached the ears of Galba but the folly of Laco explained every thing away and by consequence the emperor was lulled into security The praefect of the guards had no knowledge of the mili eu o tary character Nothing could open the eyes of a man who opposed every mea sure however excellent which did not originate with himself By the perversity of his nature he was always at variance with talents and superior judgment XXVII Ok the eighteenth day before the calends of February Galba assisted at a sacrifice in the temple of Apollo In the midst of the ceremony Umbricius the augur after inspecting the entrails of the victims announced impending treason and a lurking enemy within the walls of Rome Otho who stood near the empe ror heard this prediction but interpreted it in his own favour pleased with omens that promised so well to his cause In that moment Onomastus came to inform him that his builders and surveyors were waiting to talk with him on business This 54 THE HISTORY book as had been concerted was a signal that the conspirators were ready to throw off the mask and strike the decisive blow Otho quitted the temple having first told such as wondered at his sudden departure that being on the point of purchasing certain farm houses not in good repair he had appointed workmen to examine the buildings before he concluded his bar gain Having made that feigned excuse he walked off arm in arm with his freed man  and passing through the palace formerly belonging to Tiberius went di rectly to the great market place called the Velabrum and thence to the golden mile pillar a near the temple of Saturn At that place a small party of the prae torian soldiers in number not exceeding three and twenty saluted him emperor The sight of such an insignificant handful of men struck him with dismay but his partisans drew their swords and placing him in a litter b carried him off in triumph They were joined in their way by an equal number some of them ac complices in the treason  others in won der and astonishment hurried along by TtfF TACITUS 55 â fee current The conspirators brandish book ing their swords and rending the air with acclamations pursued their course while numbers followed in profound silence de termined to sec the issue before they took a decided part XXVIII Julius Martialis a mili tary tribune was at that time command ing officer in the camp Amazed at a treason so bold and daring and perhaps imagining that It extended wider he made no attempt to oppose the torrent His inactivity had the appearance of a con federacy in guilt The rest of the tri bunes and centurions followed the same line of caution in their solicitude for their own safety losing all sense of honour and of every public principle Such in that alarming crisis was the disposition of the camp a few seditious incendiaries dared to attempt a revolution more wished to see it and all were willing to acquiesce XXIX Galba in the mean time ig norant of all that passed continued in the 56 THS ITISTOIfcT I book temple attentive to the sacred ritesvand with his prayers fatiguing the gods of an empire now no longer his Intelligence at length arrived that a senator who by name no man could tell was carried in triumph to the camp Otho Mas soon after an nounced The people in crowds rushed forward from every quarter some repre senting the dangers greater than it was others lessening it and even in ruini still retaining their habitual flattery A coun cil was called Afterduedeliberation it was thought advisable to sound the dispositions of the cohort then on duty before the aÂ lace but without the inteqwsition of Galba His authority was to be reserved for the last extremity Piso called the men together and from the steps of the  palace addressed them to the foJj WBig purport  It is nowÂ Jny

discord the reins of go vernment passed into other hands To  secure the same tranquillity was the ob  jtect Of the late adoption By that mea  sure Galba had reason to think that he  closed the scene

place The rest of the cohort showed no sign of discontent Without noise or tumult the usual incidents of se dition they displayed their colours ac cording to the military custom and not as was imagined afterwards with a design to cover by false appearances a settled plan of treachery and revolt Celsus Ma rius Avas sent to use his influence with the OF TACITUS 6 1 A D forces from Ulyrium at

Liberty the German soldiers quartered in that place The legion draughted from the marines was not to be trusted They had seen on Galba s entry into Rome a cruel massacre of their com rades and the survivors with minds ex asperated panted for revenge At the same time Cetrius Severus Subrius Dex ter and PoinpeiusLonginus three military tribunes made the best of their way to the praetorian camp with an intention while the ferment was still recent and before a general flame was kindled to mould the minds of the men to a pacific temper Subrius and Cetrius were repulsed with menaces Longinus was roughly handled The soldiers took away his weapons un willing to listen to a man whom they considered as an officer promoted out of his turn by the favour of Galba and for that reason faithful to his prince The ma rine legion without hesitation joined the 62 THE IIISTORir BdoK praetorian malecontents The detachment from the Ulyrian army caught the infec tion and obliged Celsus to retire under at shower of darts The veterans from Germany remained for some time in suspense They had been sent by Nero to Alexandria but being recalled in a short time afterwards they returned to Rome in a distressed condition worn out with toil and weakened by sickness du ring their voyage Galba attended to their wants and in order to recruit their strength administered seasonable relief The soldiers felt the generosity of the prince and gratitude was not yet effaced from their minds XXXII The populace in the mean time with a crowd of slaves intermixed rushed into the palace demanding ven geance on the head of Otho and his par tisans The clamour was loud and disso nant like that of a rabble in the circus or amphitheatre roaring for the public sports or some new spectacle The whole was

danger and  Otho will shrink back with terror and  dismay It is not long since he went  forth by stealth He has been joined  by a few incendiaries and hurried away  to a camp where no plan is settled but  now while Galba s friends remain inac  tive he assumes the sovereign and has  time to learn how to play his part  And shall we linger here in cold debate  till the usurper having mastered the  camp conies forth to invade the forum  and under the eye of a lawful prince  ascends the capitol  In the mean time  must our valiant emperor remain trem  bling in his palace while his warlike  friends

rumour prevailed that Otho was slain in the camp The report at first was vague and uncertain but like all im portant lies gathered as it went and grew into credit It was confirmed by men who averred that they were eye witnesses on the spot and saw the blow given The tale was welcome to a great many and the credulous swallowed it without further inquiry It was afterwards thought to be a political lie framed by Otho s friends who mingled in the crowd in order to en tice Galba from his palace XXXV The city resounded with ac clamations Not only the vulgar and ignorant multitude were transported be yond all bounds but the knights and sena tors were hurried away with the torrent they forgot their fears  they rushed to the emperor s presence  they complained that the punishment of treason was taken out of their hands The men who as it ap peared soon after were the most likely to shrink from danger displayed their zeal with ostentation lavish of words yet 2 OF TACITUS 67 cowards in their hearts No man knew book that Otho was slain yet all averred it as a fact In this situation wanting certain intelligence but deceived by his courtiers Galba determined to go forth from his palace He called for his armour The weight was too much for his feeble frame andÂ in the throng that gathered round him finding himself overpowered he de sired to be placed in a litter Before he left the palace Julius Atticus a soldier of the body guard accosted him with a bloody sword in his hand crying aloud  In me you see the slayer of Otho  it  was I that killed him Galba calmly answered a Who gave you orders  Such was the spirit of the man even in the last extremity still determined to repress the licentiousness of the soldiers  by their in solence undismayed by their flattery never softened XXXVI Meanwhile the praetorian guards threw off the mask and with one voice declared for Otho They ranged themselves in a body round his person and in the ardour of their zeal placed f2 68 The history book him amidst this standards and eagles on the very tribunal where a little before stood the golden statue a of Galba The tribunes and centurions were not suffered to approach The common soldiers hav ing no kind of confidence in their officers gave the word to watch the motions of all in any rank or command The camp re sounded with shouts and mutual exhor tations not with that faint hearted zeal which draws from the mob of Rome their feeble acclamations but with one mind one general impulse all concurred in sup port of their new emperor The praeto rians were almost frantic with joy They embraced their comrades as they saw them advancing forward they clasped their hands they led them to the tribunal they repeated the military oath b and administered it to all They recommended the prince of their own choice to the affec tions of the men and the men in their turn to the favour of the prince Otho on his part omitted nothing that could conciliate the affections of the multitude He paid his court to the rabble with his hands outstretched bowing lowly down 1 OP TACITUS 39 and in order to be emperor crouching book like a slave The marine legion did not kâ vâ A U C hesitate to take the oath of fidelity By hÂ that event Otho felt himself inspired with Â Â â uncommon ardour Having hitherto tam pered with the soldiers man by man he judged right to address them in a body He took his station on the rampart of the camp and spoke to the following effect XXXVII  In what light my fellow  soldiers shall I now consider myself  In what character must 1 address you  M A private man I cannot call

the  same voice that demands vengeance on  me calls aloud for your destruction  With my life your fate is interwoven 70 THU HISTORY book  We must live or perish together There is no alternative The humanity of Galba is well known to us all Perhaps even while I speak he has pronounced  our doom To yield to the advice of  his friends will be an easy task to him  who without a request of his own free  will in cold blood could give to the  edge of the sword so many thousand in  nocent soldiers all destroyed in one  inhuman massacre My heart recoils  with horror when I reflect on the dis  astrous day when he made his public  entry into the city After receiving the  submission of the soldiers with un  heard of treachery he ordered the whole  body to be decimated a and in the  view of

and clamour reached the city of Rome Piso did not think it advisable to proceed to the camp He met Gaiba who had left the palace on his way to the forum Marius Celsus had already brought alarming tidings Some advised the emperor to return to his palace others were for taking possession of the capitol and the major part for proceeding directly to the tribunal of public harangues  num bers gave their advice for no better rea son than to clash with the opinions of others and in the distraction of jarring counsels the misfortune was that what ought to have occurred first was seen too late They decided when the opportunity was lost We are told that Laco without the privity of Galba formed a design against the life of Vinius The murder of OF TACITUS 75 that minister he thought would appease book the fury of the soldiers or it may be that v he suspected treachery and thought him 822 joined in a secret league with Otho  per ee haps his own malice was the motive But for this dark purpose neither the time nor the place was convenient the sword once drawn there was no knowing where the scene of blood would end Messengers arriving every moment increased the con sternation  the spirit of Galba s friends began to droop numbers deserted him and of all that zeal which a little before blazed out with so much ardour every spark was now extinguished XL Galba in the midst of a prodi gious conflux of people had not strength to support himself and as the waving multitude was impelled different ways he was hurried on by the torrent The tem ples the porticos and great halls round the forum were filled with crowds of gazing spectators The whole presented an awful spectacle A deep and sullen silence prevailed The very rabble was hushed Amazement sat on everv face 76 THE HISTORY book Thch eyes watched every motion and their ears caught every sound The in terval was big with terror it was neither a tumult nor a settled calm but rather the stillness of fear or smothered rage such as often precedes some dreadful ca lamity Otho was still in the camp He received intelligence that the populace had recourse to arras and thereupon ordered his troops to push forward with rapidity and prevent the impending danger At his command the Roman soldiers as if march ing to dethrone an eastern monarch a Vologeses or a Pacorus and not their own lawful sovereign advanced with im petuous fury to imbrue their hands in the blood of an old man naked and disarmed They entered the city they dispersed the common people they spurred their horses at full speed and rushing into the forum sword in hand trampled the senators under foot The sight of the capitol made np impression  the temples sanctified by the religion of ages could not restrain their fury  for the majesty of former princes they had no respect and of those who were to succeed no kind of dread They OF TACITUS 77 rushed forward to commit a detestable book i parricide forgetting in their frantic rage that crimes of that atrocious nature are sure 822 to be punished by the prince that succeeds 69 to the sovereign power XLI The prastorians no sooner ap peared in sight than the standard bearer of the cohort still remaining with Galba his name we are told was Attilius Yer gilio tore from the colours the image of Galba and dashed it on the ground That signal given the soldiers with one voice declared for Otho The people fled in consternation Such as lingered behind were attacked sword in hand The men who carried Galba in a litter were struck with terror In their fright they let him fall to the ground near the Curtian lake tf His last words according as men admired or hated him have been variously re ported According to some he asked in a suppliant tone What harm he had done  and prayed for a few days that he might discharge the donative due to the soldiers Others assure us that he presented his neck to the assassin s stroke and said 78 THE IlISTOftT book with a firm tone of voice  Strike if the good of the commonwealth requires it To ruffians thirsting for blood no matter what he said By what hand the blow was given cannot now be known Some im pute it to Terentius a resumed veteran  others to a fellow of the name of Lecanius A report still more general has transmitted down to us the name of Camurius a com mon soldier of the fifteenth legion This man it is said cut Calba s throat The rest fell on with brutal rage and finding his breast covered with armour dissevered his legs and arms Nor did the barbarians desist till the emperor lay a headless trunk deformed with wounds and wel tering in iris blood XLII Titus Vinius was the next victim The manner in which he met his fate is likewise left uncertain Whether on the first assault his utterance was sup pressed by fear or whether he had power to call out that Otho had given no orders against his life we have now no means of knowing Those words if really spoken might be an effort of pusillanimity to save OF TACITUS 79 his Life or they were the confession of a book man who was actually an accomplice in the conspiracy His life and manners leave no room to doubt but he was capa ble of joining in a parricide of which his own administration a was the principal cause He fell by a wound that shattered the joint of his knee and a9 he lay stretched in that condition he was run through the body by Julius Carus a le gionary soldier He expired before the temple of Julius Caesar XLIII While the rebels were acting their horrible tragedy the age beheld in the conduct of one man a splendid ex ample of courage and fidelity Sempro nius Densus was the person a centurion of the praetorian cohort Having been or dered by Galba to join the guard that es corted Piso he no sooner saw a band of armed assassins than he advanced to op pose their fury brandishing his poniard and exclaiming against the horrible deed With his voice with his hand with every effort in the power of man he made a brave 80 THE HISTORY resistance and gave Piso wounded as he was an opportunity of making his escape Piso reached the temple of Vesta where a slave of the state touched with compas sion conducted him to his own private apartment Piso lay concealed for some time not indebted to the sanctity of the temple nor to the rites of religion but sheltered by the obscurity of the place At length Sulpicius Florus who belonged to a British cohort and had been made by Galba a citizen of Rome and Statius Murcus a praetorian soldier arrived in quest of him by Otho s special order By these two men Piso was dragged to the vestibule of the temple where under re peated blows he breathed his last XLIV In the midst of a general mas sacre no murder we are told gave so much satisfaction to Otho nor was there among the heads cut off a one at which he gazed with such ardent eyes By this event he felt himself relieved from all ap prehensions The fate of Galba and of Titus Vinius affected him in a different OF TACITUS 81 manner The former brought to his mind book an idea of majesty fallen from a state of elevation  and the death of the latter awakened the memory of an early friend ship and even into a heart like his fierce cruel and ambitious infused a tincture of melancholy When Piso fell an enemy ex pired Feeling for him neither regret nor compunction he gave a loose to joy The three heads were fixed on poles and car ried amidst the ensigns of the cohorts with the eagle of the legion through the streets of Rome A band of soldiers fol lowed stretching forth their hands reek ing With blood and boasting aloud that they gave the mortal wounds or that they were present aiding and abetting all with truth or falsehood claiming the honour of an atrocious deed No less than one hundred and twenty memorials presented on this occasion by persons who claimed the reward of crimes committed on that dreadful day were afterwards found by Vitellius and the several authors after diligent search made by his orders Were punished with death not from motives of regard for the memory of Galba but with vol v o 82 THE HISTORY book the usual policy of princes who think vâ vâ by punishing the malefactors of a former A822 c reign that they establish a precedent and 69 by the terrors of future vengeance effec tually secure themselves XLV Another senate and another people seemed now to be in possession of Rome All pressed forward to the camp You would have thought it a race of ser vility in which every man endeavoured to outstrip his fellow citizens and be the first to pay his court They joined in reviling the name of Galba and all applauded the conduct of the soldiers They thronged round Otho fawning to kiss his hand and in proportion to their want of sincerity playing the farce with overacted zeal Otho was not deficient in the mummery of thanks and gratitude Attentive to all and gracious to individuals he took care at the same time by his looks and actions to restrain the soldiers who by the fero eity of their looks seemed to threaten farther mischief Marius Celsus the con sul elect was the object of their venge ance He had been the friend of Galba OF TACITUS 83 and in the last extremity continued faith ful to that unhappy prince His talents and integrity gave offence to a lawless crew with whom every virtue was a crime They demanded his immediate execution But their views were too apparent The best and ablest men in Rome were doomed to destruction by a set of men who panted to let loose their rage and lay a scene of blood of plunder and devastation Otho was not yet in fulness of power His au thority was sufficient to command the per petration of crimes  to prohibit them was still beyond him The part he assumed was that of a man enraged and bent on some atrocious deed In that pretended fury he ordered Celsus to be loaded with irons as a man reserved for heavier punish ment and by that stratagem saved him from destruction XLVI The praetorians from this time knew no control They chose their own praefects namely Plotius Firmus for merly a common soldier raised afterwards to the command of the night guard and even during the life of Galba a partisan a 2 84 THE HISTORY book in favour of Otho To him they added vâ vâ Licinius Proculus a man who lived in n 822 timacy with Otho and was supposed to Â be an accomplice in all his dark designs For the office of governor of Rome they named Flavius Sabinus a influenced in their choice by their respect for the me mory of Nero who had committed to him the same important charge The majority had another motive  by concurring in this nomination they meant to pay a compli ment to Vespasian the brother of Sabinus Their next object was to abolish the fees exacted by the centurions for occasional exemptions from duty and for leave of absence These fees in fact were an annual tribute out of the pockets of the common men In consequence of this abuse a fourth part of every company was seen rambling about the country or idly loitering in the very camp The centurion received his perquisite and had no other care Nor was the soldier solicitous about the price  he purchased a right to be idle and the means by which he enabled him self to defray the expense gave him no kind of scruple By theft by robbery OF TACITUS 55 and by servile employments he gained enough to enrich his officer and the of ficer in return sold a dispensation from labour and the duties of the service Who ever had hoarded up a little money was for that reason harassed with discipline and oppressed with labour till he pur chased the usual indulgence By these extortions the soldier was impoverished his stock was exhausted  and after a va gabond life his industry relaxed and his vigour wasted he returned to the camp without courage strength or money By these pernicious practices corruption grew into a system The common men forgot all discipline their morals went to ruin and in the natural progress of vice all became ripe for tumult insurrections and civil war To remedy the mischief and at the same time not to alienate the minds of the centurions Otho undertook to pay an annual equivalent to the officers out of his own revenue This reform was no doubt both wise and just Good princes adopted it afterwards and it is now a settled rule in the military system Laco die late c6aunander of the praetorians was 86 THE HISTORY condemned to an island there as was given out to pass the remainder of his days but a veteran soldier whom Otho had dispatched for the purpose put an end to his life Martianus Icelus being of no higher rank than that of a manu mitted slave died by the hand of the executioner i  XLVII After the horrors of a day spent in guilt and blood and carnage if any thing could add to the public misery it was the joy that succeeded to that dis mal scene The praetor of the city a sum moned a meeting of the senate The othei magistrates strove to distinguish them selves by the vilest adulation The fathers assembled without delay The tribunitian power the name of Augustus and all im perial honours enjoyed by former princes were by a decree granted to Otho Several members of that assembly were conscious of having thrown odious colours on the name and character of their new emperor and hoped to expiate by present flattery the bitterness of former invectives Whe ther Otho despised those injurious reflec OP TACITUS 87 tions or stored them in his memory for book future occasions is uncertain The short ness of his reign has left that matter unde cided He was conveyed in triumph to the capitol and thence to the imperial palace In his way he saw the forum discoloured with blood and heaps of slaughtered citizens lying round him He granted leave to remove the dead bodies and to perform the rites of sepulture The remains of Piso were buried by his wife Verania b and Scribonianus his bro ther The last duty to Titus Vinius was performed by his daughter Crispina c Their heads which the murderers had re served for sale were found and redeemed at a stipulated price XLVIII Pi so had well nigh completed the thirty first year of his age always high in the esteem of the public yet never happy Two of his brothers suffered a violent death Magnus by the command of Claudius and Crassus by the cruelty of Nero He himself had passed a con siderable part of his time in banishment an outlaw for some years and four days a 88 THE HISTORY 1 A U C A D book prince By the adoption of Galba be was raised above his elder brother but 823  by that preference all he gained was to be murdered first Titus Vinius had reached the age of fifty seven  a man of unsettled principle and various manners His father was of a prae torian family his grandfather by the mar ternal line was in the number proscribed by the triumvirate His first campaign under Calvisius Sabinus a began with disgrace The wife of hi commanding officer prompted by wanton curiosity went by night in the disguise of a com mon soldier to view the site and dispo sition of the camp In her frolic she went round to visit the sentinels and the posts and stations of the army Arriving at length at the place where the eagles were deposited she did not scruple to commit the act of adultery on that sacred spot Vinius was charged as her accomplice and by order of Caligula loaded with irons By the revolution which soon afte happened he regained his liberty and from that time rose to honours He dis OF TACITUS 9g charged the office of preetor and after book wards commanded a legion free from re  proach His name however was soon after branded with a crime which a com mon slave would have blushed to commit Being a guest at the table of Claudius be was charged with pilfering a golden goblet On the following day that emperor to distinguish Vinius from the rest of his company gave orders that he should be trusted with nothing better than a cup of earthen ware Notwithstanding this dis grace he became proconsul of Narbon Gaul and acquitted himself in hi s admini stration with distinguished firmness and equal integrity The friendship of Galba placed him on the brink of a precipice Bold and prompt in action of an enter prising genius and undaunted courage he was at the same time dark subtle and deceitful Qualified to succeed in whatever he undertook and by nature ready for good or evil deeds he practised vice and virtue with alternate success and equal ardour His last will on account of his immoderate wealth was declared 90 THE HISTORY book null and void That of Piso was confirmed v â by his poverty   A U C 622 AD 69 XLIX Galba s body during the night that followed the murder lay exposed to numberless indignities It was at length conveyed by Argius an antient slave and steward of that unfortunate emperor to the private gardens of his master and there deposited in an humble manner without honour or distinction His head in a mangled condition was fixed on a pole by the rabble of the camp and set up to public view near the tomb of Patro bius a slave manumitted by Nero and by order of Galba put to death In that situation it was found on the following day and added to the ashes of the body which had been already committed to the flames Such was the end of Servius Galba in the seventy third year of his age He had seen the reign of five princes and enjoyed during that whole period a series of prosperity happy as a private citizen as a prince unfortunate He was descended from a long line of ancestors His wealth OF TACITUS 91 was great his talents not above medio crity Free from vice he cannot be cele brated for his virtues He knew the value of fame yet was neither arrogant nor vain glorious Having no rapacity he was an economist of his own and of the public treasure careful to a degree of avarice To his friends and freedmen he was open generous and even resigned to their will When his choice was happily made his in dulgence however excessive was at worst an amiable weakness  when bad men sur rounded him his good nature bordered on folly The splendour of his rank and the felicity with which he steered through the xiangers of a black and evil period helped to raise the value of his character his in dolence passed for wisdom and inactivity took the name of prudenceV In the vigour of his days he served with honour in Ger many as proconsul of Africa he governed with moderation and the Nethermost Spain when he was advanced in years felt the mildness of his administration While no higher than a private citizen his merit was thought superior to his rank and the suffrages of mankind would have 92 THE HISTORY book pronounced him worthy of empire had he â v â never made the experiment A U C 822 Â 9 L Iif this disastrous juncture while Rome was shuddering with horror at the late dreadful carnage and from the well known vices of Otho s nature men were in dread of worse evils still to come dis patches from Germany brought an ac count of a new storm ready to burst in that quarter The revolt of Vitellius and the armies under his command was no longer a secret The intelligence arrived before the death of Galba but was sup pressed by that emperor that the sedition on the Upper Rhine might be thought the only mischief that disturbed the tran quillity of the empire At length the true state of affairs was known and a general panic spread through the city Not only the senators and Roman knights who had still some shadow of authority but the meaner populace mourned over the dis tractions of their country All were grieved to see two men of the most perni cious characters enervated by luxury and abandoned to every vice choseis by some OF TACITUS 93 fatality to be the bane and ruin of the com monwealth The crimes and miseries which under the late emperors were one continued pestilence were no longer the objects that employed the public mind The civil wars were fresh in the memory of all they talked of Rome besieged and taken by her own armies they remem bered Italy laid waste the provinces plun dered the battles of Pharsalia and Philip pi and the siege of Modena and Peru sia a two places well known in history and each of them the scene of public calamity  In those tempestuous times the strug  gle it was observed lay between men  of illustrious character and by their  contentions the state was brought to the  brink of ruin But even then under  Julius Caesar the empire still survived  and flourished It survived under Au  gustus and gained additional lustre  Under Pompey and Brutus had their  arms prevailed the republic would have  been once more established But those  men have passed away Otho and Vi 94 THE HISTORY iook  tellius are now the competitors  and for them or ekher of them shall the peo ple crowd to the temples  Must they pray for a tyrant to reign over them   Vows in such a cause were impious  since in a war between two detestable  rivals he who conquers will be armed  with power to commit still greater crimes u and prove himself the worst 1 Such were the reasonings of the people Some who saw at a distance fixed their eyes on Vespasian and the armies in the East They foresaw new commotions in that part of the world and dreaded the calamities of another war Vespasian they agreed was in every respect superior to the two chiefs who now convulsed the state but even his character b was rather proble matical The truth is of all the princes who to his time reigned at Rome he was the only one whom power reformed and made a better man LI That the revolt under Vitellius may be seen in its true light it will be necessary to state the causes that produced it I therefore go back to the origin of that OF TACITUS 95 event After the defeat of Julius Vindex a book and the total rout of his armies the victorious legions enriched with booty grew wanton with success To men who without fatigue or danger had closed a lucrative war the love of enterprise be came a natural passion They preferred hostilities to a state of inaction and plun der to the soldier s pay They had till the late commotions called them forth en dured the hardships of a rigorous service in a bleak climate and a desolate coun try where even in time of peace disci pline Was enforced with strict severity But discipline they knew would be re laxed by civil discord In the distractions of parties both sides encourage licentious ness and by consequence fraud cor ruption and treachery triumph with im punity The mutinous soldiers were abun dantly provided with arms and horses both for parade and service Before the late war in Gaul they saw no more than the company or the troop of horse to which they belonged  Stationed at different quarters they never went beyond their limits and the boundaries of the provinces 6 96 THE HISTORY book kept the armies distinct and separate Being at length drawn together to make head against Vindex they felt their own strength and having tasted the sweets of victory they wanted to renew the troubles by which their rapacity had been so amply gratified They no longer treated the Gauls as their allies and friends they con sidered them as enemies and a vanquished people In these hostile sentiments they were confirmed by such of the Gallic nation as dwelt on the borders of the Rhine The people on that side of the country had taken up arms against Vindex and his allies whom since the death of that chief they chose to call the Galbian Faction and now by every artifice by infusions of their own malice they endeavoured to kindle a war between the Romans and their countrymen The animosity of the legions was easily excited The Se quanians the iEduans and other states according to their opulence were the chief objects of resentment The soldiers thought of nothing but towns assaulted 7 OF TACITUS 97 and carried by storm the plunder of book houses and the desolation of the country In the heat of imagination every man anticipated the booty that was to fall to his share To their arrogance and avarice the never failing vices of the strongest they united the indignation of men who felt themselves insulted by the vainglory with which the iEduans and the rest of the obnoxious states made it their boast that in despite of the legions they had extorted from Galba a remission of one fourth of their tribute and an extension of their territory To these incentives was added a report artfully thrown out and readily believed that the legions were to be deci mated and the best and bravest of the centurions to be dismissed from the ser vice To increase the ferment tidings of an alarming nature arrived from every quarter and in particular a storm was said to be gathering over the city of Rome The people of Lyons still faithful to the memory of Nero and the avowed enemies of Galba took care to disseminate the worst reports From that place as from the centre of intelligence rumours con VOL V U 98 THE HISTORY book stantly issued  but the camp was the maj gazine of news where invention framed the lie of the day and credulity stood ready to receive it The passions of the soldiers were in constant agitation malice embittered their minds and fear held them in suspense But they viewed their num bers and their courage revived They found themselves in force and in full se curity laughed at the idea of danger LIL It was near the calends of De cember in the preceding year Avhen Au lus Vitellius first appeared in the Lower Germany He made it his business to re view the legions in their winter quarters he restored several officers who had been degraded and relieved others from the disgrace of an ignominious sentence In these proceedings he acted in some hv  stances with justice in others with a view to his own ambition He condemned the sordid avarice with which Fonteius Capito granted or refused rank in the army He established a fair and regular system of military promotion and in the eyes of the soldiers appeared to exceed the powers OP TACITUS 99 Usually vested in consular generals He seemed to be an officer of superior weight and grandeur Reflecting men saw the baseness of his motives a while his crea tures extolled every part of his conduct The profusion which without judgment or oeconomy lavished away in bounties all his own property and squandered that of others was by his sycophants called benevolence and generosity Even the vices that sprung from lust of dominion were by his creatures transformed into so many virtues In the two armies on the Upper and Lower Rhine there were no doubt men well disposed and of sober conduct but at the same time both camps were in fested by a set of desperate incendiaries At the head of the factious and the tur bulent stood Alienus Ca cina and Fabius Valens each the commander of a legion both remarkable for their avarice and both of a daring spirit ready for any desperate enterprise Valens had served the interest of Galba by detecting Verginius as soon as the conduct of that officer seemed to be n 2 100 THE HISTORY book equivocal he had also crushed the ma chinations of Capito and for those ser vices thought himself ill requited Stung with resentment he now endeavoured to rouse the ambition of Vitellius  The  soldiers he said  were zealous in his  service and the name of Vitellius stood  in high esteem throughout the Roman  world From Hordeonius Flaccus no  opposition was to be apprehended  Britain was ready to declare against  Galba and the German auxiliaries  would follow their example The pro  vinces wavered in their duty and by  consequence the precarious authority  of a feeble old man would be soon trans  ferred to other hands Fortune courted  Vitellius he had nothing to do but to  open his arms and receive her favours  Verginius indeed had every thing to  chill his hopes and damp his resolution  He had no splendid line of ancestors to  recommend him He was of an eques  trian family but his father lived and  died in obscurity A man of his cast  would have proved unequal to the  weight of empire A private station was OF TACITUS 101  to him a post of safety The case of book  Vitellius was very different Sprung  from a father who had been three times  consul once in conjunction with the em  peror Claudius and who moreover  had discharged the office of censor he  might well aspire to the highest eleva  tion The honours of his family marked  him out for the imperial dignity Too  great for a private station he must reach  the summit of power or be utterly  lost Notwithstanding this inflamma tory speech the phlegmatic temper of Vi tellius was not to be roused A few faint wishes fluttered at his heart but hope could find no admission LIII Meanwhile Caecina who ser ved in the army on the Upper Rhine had drawn to himself the affections of the army Young and of a comely figure tall and well proportioned with an air of dignity in his deportment a flow of eloquencej and an aspiring genius he had all the qualities that made an impression on the military mind Though a young man he discharged the office of quaestor in the 102 THE HISTORY book province of Bretica in Spain and was among the first that went over to Galba s interest That emperor to reward his zeal gave him the command of a legion in Ger many but finding afterwards that he had been guilty of embezzling the public money he ordered him to he called to a strict account Caecina was not of a tem per to submit with patience He resolved to embroil the state and in the general confusion hoped to find a remedy for his own private afflictions The seed plots of rebellion were already laid in the army In the war against Vindex they had taken the field and till they heard that Nero was no more never declared in favour of Galba Even in that act of submission they showed no forward zeal but suffered the legions on the Lower Rhine to take the lead There was still another circum stance that helped to sharpen their dis content The Treviri the Lingones and other states which had felt the severity of Galba s edicts or had seen their territory reduced to narrower limits lay contiguous to the winter quarters of the legions Hence frequent intercourse cabals and OF TACITUS 103 A D seditious meetings in which the soldiers book grew more corrupt envenomed as they â vâ 7 A U C were by the politics of discontented pea  sants Hence their zeal to promote the interest of Verginius and when that pro ject failed their readiness to list under any other chief LIV The Lingones in token of friend ship had sent presents to the legions and in conformity to their antient usage the symbolical figure of two right hands clasp ing one another Their deputies appear ed with the mien and garb of affliction They went round the camp and in every quarter disburthened their complaints In the tents and in the place for the stand ards and eagles they painted forth their own private injuries while other states enjoyed the favour and the protection of Galba Finding that they made an im pression they represented to the soldiers the dangers that hung over their own heads and the hardships under which they laboured The Romans caught the infection A general phrensy spread through the camp the flame of sedition 104 THE HISTORY book was ready to break out and some dread Â â â j ful mischief seemed to be impending A U C  822 when Hordeonius Flaccus in the dead of A D 69 night ordered the deputies to depart without further delay A report soon pre vailed that they were all treacherously murdered and that if the soldiers did not instantly provide for their own safety the best and bravest of the army would be cruelly butchered under covert of the night far from their comrades and with out the knowledge of their friends A se cret combination was immediately formed The soldiers joined in a bond of union The auxiliary cohorts at first suspected of a design to rise against the legions and put the whole body to the sword entered into the league with eager ardour Such is the nature of profligate and abandoned minds inpeace and profound tranquillity they seldom agree but for seditious pur i poses a coalition is easily formed LV The legions on the Lower Rhine on the calends of January went through the usual form of swearing fidelity to Galba but the form only was observed OF TACITUS 105 No man was seen to act with alacrity In book the foremost ranks a feeble sound was heard  the words of the oath were re peated with an unwilling murmur while the rest remained in sullen silence each man as usual in dangerous enterprises expecting the bold example of his com rades ready to second the insurrection yet not daring to begin it A leaven of discordant humours pervaded the whole mass of the army The first and fifth le gions were the most outrageous some of them pelted the images of Galba with a volley of stones The fifteenth and six teenth abstained from acts of violence but were loud and clamorous they bawled sedition but waited for ringleaders to be gin the fray In the Upper Germany the tumult was still more violent On the same calends of January the fourth and eighteenth legions quartered together in one winter camp dashed the images of Galba into frag ments In this outrage the fourth legion led the way and the eighteenth after balancing for some time followed their 106 THE HISTORY book example Unwilling however to incur the imputation of a rebellion against their country they agreed to revive the anti quated names of the senate and roman people and in that republican form took the oath of fidelity Not one commander 1 of a legion nor even so much as a tribune appeared in favour of G alba on the con trary many of them as often happens in cases of public confusion not only con nived but helped to increase the tumult The mutineers were still without a leader No man took upon him to harangue the multitude no orator ascended the tri bunal nor could the incendiaries tell in whose service their eloquence was to be employed LVI Hordeonius Flaccus beheld this scene of confusion and though a consular commander never once inter posed with his authority to restrain the violent to secure the wavering or to ani mate the well affected He looked on a calm spectator tame and passive  it may be added innocent but innocent through sluggish indolence Four centurions of 2 OF TACITUS 10 the eighteenth legion namely Nonius Re ceptus Donatius Valens Romilius Mar cellus and Calpurnius Repentinus at tempted to defend the images of Galba The soldiers attacked them with impe tuous violence and all four were loaded with fetters From that moment all fide lity was at an end The obligation of the former oath was no longer binding It happened in this as in all seditions one set appeared to be the most numerous the rest followed the leaders and the whole herd was of one party In the course of the night that followed the ca lends of January the eagle bearer of the fourth legion arrived at the Agrippinian colony a where Vitellius was engaged at a banquet with intelligence that the fourth and eighteenth legions having de stroyed the images of Galba took a new form of oath to the senate and roman people As that government existed no longer the oatli Avas deemed a nullity In this crisis it was judged proper to seize the opportunity that fortune offered and by the nomination of an emperor fix the wavering temper of the legions Di 108 THE HISTORY book spatches were accordingly sent to inform the army in the Lower Germany that the soldiers on the Upper Rhine had revolted from Galba and that by consequence it remained for them either to march against the rebels or for the sake of peace and mutual concord to create another em peror In choosing for themselves they would hazard little but indecision might be dangerous o LVII The winter quarters o of the first legion were nearest to the residence of Vitellius Fabius Valens was the com manding officer a prompt and daring leader of sedition On the following day he put himself at the head of the cavalry belonging to his own legion and with a party of the auxiliaries proceeded by a rapid march to the Agrippinian colony He no sooner entered the city than he saluted Vitellius by the title of emperor The legions of the province with zeal and ardour followed his example and three days before the nones of January the le gions in Upper Germany declared for Vi tellius losing all memory of the senate OF TACITUS 109 and the Roman people Those specious book words which a few days before resounded with so much energy Avere dropt at once and the men it now was plain were never in their hearts the soldiers of a republic The Agrippinian people the Treveri and Lingones were determined not to be be hind hand in demonstrations of zeal They offered a supply of arms and horses of men and money in proportion to their re spective abilities The strong and valiant were willing to serve in person the rich opened their treasure and the skilful gave their advice The leading chiefs as well in the colonies as in the camp who had already enriched themselves by the spoils of war wished for another victory that might bring with it an accumulation of wealth The zeal with which they enr tered into the league was what might be expected but the alacrity of the common men Avas beheld with wonder Poor and destitute they made a tender of their tra velling subsistence their belts their ac coutrements and the silver ornaments of their armour all excited by one general impulse a sudden fit of blind enthusiasm 110 THE HISTOR I In their motives there was no doubtj a mingle of avarice  and plunder they hoped would be the reward of valour LVIII Vitellius after bestowing the highest praise on the spirit Avith which thd Soldiers embraced his cause proceeded to regulate the various departments of public business He transferred the offices hi therto granted to the imperial freedmen to the Roman knights and the fees claimed by the centurions for exemptions from duty were for the future to be defrayed out of the revenue of the prince The fury of the soldiers demanding vengeance on particular persons was not to be repressed He yielded in some instances and in others eluded their resentment under colour of reserving the obnoxious fof heavier pu nishment Pompeius Propinquus the go vernor of Belgic Gaul was put to death on the spot but Julius Burdo who com manded the German fleet was saved by art artful stratagem The army consi dered that officer as the accuser first and afterwards as the murderer of Fonteius Gapito whose memory was still held in Of TACITUS Ill fespeCt To pardon openly was not in book the power of Vitellius  he could execute vÂ in open day but to be merciful he was si obliged to deceive Burdo remained in Â Â prison till the victory obtained by Vitel lius appeased the wrath of the soldiers He then was set at liberty In the mean time Centurio Crispinus who with his own hand had shed the blood of Capito suffered as a victim to expiate that atro cious deed His guilt was manifest the soldiers demanded his blood and Vitellius thought a man of that description no kind of loss LIX Julius Civilis was the next whom the army doomed to destruction  but being of high rank and consequehce among the Batavians fear of a rupture With that fierce and warlike people saved his life There were at that time in tho territory of the Lingones no less than eight Batavian cohorts annexed at first as auxiliaries to the fourteenth legion but separated in the distraction of the times a body of men in that juncture of the greatest moment It was in their power 112 THE HISTORY book to turn the scale in favour of whatever party they espoused Nonius Donatius Romilius and Calpurnius the four centu rions already mentioned were by order of Vitellius hurried to execution They had remained steady in their duty to their prince and fidelity is a crime which men in open rebellion never pardon Valerius Asiaticus the governor of Belgic Gaul to whom in a short time after Vitellius gave his daughter in marriage and Junius Blaesus who presided in the province of Lyons and had under his command the Italic legion a and the body of horse called the Taurinian cavalry Z went over to the party of the new emperor The forces in Rhaetia were not long in suspense and the legions in Britain declared with out hesitation in favour of Vitellius LX Britain was at that time go verned by Trebellius Maximus a a man for his avarice and sordid practices de spised and hated by the army Between him and Roscius Caelius who command ed the twentieth legion there had been a long subsisting quarrel renewed of late 8 OF TACITUS J1S Vith keener acrimony and embittered by book the distractions of a civil war Ctelius was charged by his superior officer with being the fomenter of sedition and an enemy to discipline and good order in return he recriminated alleging that the commander in chief plundered the legions and left the soldiers to languish in distress and poverty From this dissension be tween their officers the common men taught the infection All discipline was at an end Licentiousness prevailed and toe tumult rose at length to such a height that Trebellius insulted openly by the auxiliaries deserted by the cavalry and betrayed by the cohorts wps obliged to  for refuge to Vitellius The province however notwithstanding the flight of a consular governor remained in a perfect state of tranquillity The commanders of the legions held the reins of government by their commissions equal in authority but eclipsed by the enterprising genius and the daring spirit of Caelius LXL The arrival of the forces from Britain was an accession of strength and vol v i 114 THE HISTORY book thereupon Yitellius flushed with hope abounding in resources and strong in numbers resolved to carry the war into Italy by two different routes under the conduct of two commanders Fabius Va lens was sent forward with instructions to draw to his interest the people of Gaul and if he found them obstinate to lay waste their country with fire and sword He was afterwards to pass over the Cottian Alps a and make an irruption into Italy Caecina the other general was ordered to take a nearer way over the Penine moun tains and make his descent on that side The floAver of the army from the Lower Rhine with the eagle of the fifth legion and the cohorts and cavalry amounting to forty thousand men were put under the command of Valens Caecina ad vanced from the Upper Germany with no less than thirty thousand of which the one and twentieth legion was the main strength Each commander had a rein forcement of German auxiliaries Vitel lius followed them with a third army tq crush whatever resisted and bring up the whole weight of the war OF TACITUS 115 LXII The new emperor and his presented a striking contrast thei burneis with impatience mnr witkvone voice demanded to be led against t enemy  It was time 1 they said  to ft push on the war with vigour while the  two Gauls are in commotion and Spain  is yet undecided The winter season  is far from being an obstacle nor were  the men to be amused with idle nego  tiations to bring on a compromise  Italy in all events must be invaded and  Rome taken by storm In civil dissen u sions it is expedition that gives life and  energy to all military operations The  crisis called for vigour and debate Avas a out of season Vitellius in the mean time loitered away his time in dull repose lifeless torpid drunk at noon day and overwhelmed with gluttony a The im perial dignity he thought consisted in riot and profusion and he resolved to en joy the prerogative of a prince The spirit of the soldiers supplied the defects of their prince They neither wanted him in the ranks to animate the brave nor to rouse the tardy and inactive Each matt  12 v 115 THE HISTORY book was his own general With one consent they formed the ranks and demanded the signal for the march They saluted Vitel lius by the name of Germanicus Â that of Caesar he chose to decline and even after his victory always rejected it Va lens began his march On that very day his army beheld a joyful omen An eagle appeared at the head of the Mnes measuring his flight by the movement of the soldiersr as if to guide them on their way The air resounded with shouts of joy while the bird proceeded in the same regular course undismayed by the uproar and still seeming to direct the march A phae nomenon so unusual was considered as a sure prognostic of a signal victory LXIII The army advanced in good order towards the state of the Treveri whom they considered as their friends and allies At Divodurum a a city of the Mediomatrici they received every mark of kindness but were seized unaccounta bly with a sudden panic in its effect sc extraordinary that the soldiers graspec their arms and fell upon the innocent in 3 OFTACITUS 117 habitants sword in hand In this dread ful outrage the love of plunder had no share a sudden phrensy possessed every mind and as the cause was unknown no remedy could be applied No less than four thousand men were massacred and if the entreaties of the general had not at length prevailed the whole city had been laid in blood The rest of Gaul was alarmed by this horrible catastrophe to such a degree that wherever the army approached whole cities with the magis trates at their head went forth in a sup pliant manner to sue for mercy Mothers with their children lay prostrate on the ground as if a conquering enemy ad vanced against them and though nor thing like hostility subsisted the wretched people were obliged in profound peace to deprecate all the horrors of war LXIV Valens arrived with his army at the capital city of the Leucians a At that place he received intelligence of the murder of Galba and the accession of Otho The news made no impression on the soldiers Unmoved by joy or fear 11B THE HISTORY book they thought of nothing but the spoils of war The Gauls released by this event from their attachment to Galba were now at liberty to choose their party Otho and Vitellius were objects of their detes tation  but they feared the latter The army proceeded on their march to the territory of the Lingones a people well disposed towards Vitellius They met with a friendly reception and passed their time in acts of mutual kindness But this amicable intercourse was interrupted by the intemperance of the cohort 6 which had been separated as already mentioned from the fourteenth legion and by Valens incorporated with his army Being of the Batavian nation and by na ture fierce and warlike they lived on bad terms with the legions Opprobrious words passed between them  from words contention arose the legionary soldiers entered into the dispute and joined the different parties as judgment or inclina tion prompted The quarrel rose to such a pitch that if Valens had not interposed and by making a few examples recalled the Batavians to a sense of their duty a OF TACITUS 119 bloody battle must have been the conse book quence â vâ 1 A U C 822 A D A colourable pretext for falling on the w iEduans was the ardent wish of the army but that people not only complied with the demand of money and arms but added a voluntary supply of provisions What was thus done by the iEduans through motives of fear the people of Lyons per formed with inclination and zeal to serve the cause of Vitellius From that city the Italic legion and the Tauiunian ca valry were ordered to join the army The eighteenth cohort c which had been used to winter there was left in garrison Manlius Valens at that time commanded the Italic legion This officer had ren dered good service to the cause but his services were repaid with ingratitude by Vitellius The fact was Fabius Valens the commander in chief had given a secret stab to his reputation and to cover his malice played an artful game with all the plausible appearance of sly hypocrisy In public he praised the person whom he wounded in the dark 120 THE HISTORY LXV The late war had kindled afresh the deadly feud which had long subsisted between the people of Lyons and the in habitants of Vienne a In the various battles which they had fought with al ternate success and prodigious slaughter it was visible that so much animosity waa not merely the effect of party rage in a contest between Nero and Galba The people of Lyons had felt the weight of Galba s displeasure they saw their re venues b wrested out of their hands and confiscated to the imperial treasury while their inveterate enemies enjoyed the fa vours of the emperor Hence a new source of jealousy The two cities were separated by a river c but they were hostile neigh bours and they saw each other with in flamed resentment Revenge and malice were not to be appeased The citizens of Lyons omitted nothing that could excite the legions against their rivals  they talked with the soldiers man by man and no thing less than the utter destruction of Vienne could satisfy their indignation  Lyons they said  had been besieged  by their mortal enemies who had taken OF TACITUf 121 up arms in the cause of Vinde awl ioox  lately raised recruit to complete the  legions in the service of Galba To these incentives they added the tempta tion of plunder in a rich and opulent city Finding that they had infused their rancour into the minds of the soldiers they no longer depended on secret prac tices but openly and in a body pre ferred their petition imploring the army to march forth the redressers of wrong and rase to the ground a city that had been the nursery of war and a hive of enemies a foreign race who hated the Roman name Lyons they said was a confederate colony d a portion of the army willing at all times to share in the good or evil fortune of the empire The issue of the present war might be dis astrous to their party They therefore im plored the legions not to leave them in the event of a defeat at the mercy of a furious and implacable enemy IjXVI These entreaties had their ef fect The legions were roused to ven geance and the flame rose to such a 122 THE HISTORY book height that the commanders and other officers despaired of being able to extin guish it The inhabitants of Vienne had notice of their danger They came forth in solemn procession bearing in their hands a the sacred vestments and all the usual tokens of peace and humble suppli cation They met the Romans on their march and falling prostrate on the ground clasped their knees and in a pa thetic strain deprecated the vengeance ready to burst upon them Fabius Valens judged it expedient to order a distribution of three hundred sesterces to each man The soldiers began to relent and the colony was respected for its worth and an tient dignity The general pleaded in be half of the inhabitants and was heard Avith attention The state however was ob liged to furnish a supply of arms and war like stores Individuals with emulation contributed from their private stock The report however was that the people in good time applied a large sum of money and purchased the protection of the com mander in chief Thus much is certain that after being for a longtime depressed O TACITTS 123 vith poverty he grew suddenly rich but book toofe no pains to conceal his affluence The art of rising in the world with mode ration was not the talent of Valens His passions had been restrained by indigence and now when fortune smiled the sudden taste of pleasure hurried him into excess A beggar in his youth he was in old age a voluptuous prodigal The army proceeded by slow marches through the territory of the Allobrogians and thence to the Vocontians the general during the whole progress making his market at every place and selling his fa vours for a sum of money For a bribe he fixed the length of each day s march and shifted his camp for a price agreed upon between him and the owners of the lands In all these exactions Yalens enforced his orders with unrelenting cruelty nor did he blush to drive open bargains with the ma gistrates of the several cities Torches and firebrands were prepared to fire the town of Lucus situate in the territory of the Vocontians and the place would infal libly have been burnt to the ground if the 24 THE HISTORY book people had not ransomed themselves with a considerable sum Where pecuniary bribes were not to be had women were obliged to resign their persons and pro stitution became the price of common hu manity In this manner gratifying his avarice or his brutal passions Yalens ar rived at the foot of the Alps   LXVII C ucina who commanded the second army marked his way with greater rapine and more horrible cruelty He found in the territory of the Helvetians abundant cause to provoke a man of his ferocious temper The people of that di strict originally a Gallic nation a were renowned in former tiroes for their valour and their exploits in war Of late years the history of their ancestors was their only â glory Not having heard of the death of Galba they were unwilling to acknow ledge Vitellius In this disposition of their minds they had soon a cause of quarrel occasioned by the rapacity of the twenty first legion That body of men fell in with a party who were escorting a sum of money to a strong fort where the Helve tians had immemorially maintained a gar book rison The Romans seized the whole as law ful plunder An act of violence so unwar ranted raised the indignation of the people Determined to make reprisals they inter cepted a small party on their way to Pan nonia with letters from the German army to the legions stationed in that country They seized the papers and detained in custody a centurion with some of his sol diers This to such a man as Caecina was ample provocation He wished for notlung so much as a pretence for open hostility Whenever he took umbrage he struck his blow without delay To defer the punish ment were to leave time for repentance He marched against the Helvetians and having laid waste the country sacked a place built fusing the leisure of a long peace in the form of a municipal town remarkable for the beauty of the situation and by reason of its salubrious waters b much frequented Not content with this act of revenge he sent â dispatches into Rhaetia with orders to the auxiliaries of that country to hang upon the rear of the Helvetians while he advanced to attack them in front 126 THE HISTORY LXVIII The spirit of the Helvetians fierce and intrepid while the danger was at a distance began to droop as soon as the war drew nearer In the beginning of these hostilities they had chosen Claudius Se verus to command their forces but terror and confusion followed They neither  knew the use of their arms nor the advan tage of discipline To keep their ranks in battle was not their practice nor were they able to act in concert with their united force The contest they now perceived must be unequal with a veteran army and their fortifications being every Avhere in decay to stand a siege was not advisable Caecina advanced at the head of a nume rous army the cavalry and auxiliary forces from Rhaetia with the youth of that coun try enured to arms and trained to the art of war were ready to attack them in the rear The country was laid waste and a dreadful carnage followed The Helve tians betook themselves to flight and after wandering about in a general panic wounded maimed and unable to resist they threw down their arms and fled for refuge to the mountain known by the name of Vocetius a A band of Thra OP TACITUS 127 ciaris was sent to dislodge them Driven B Â Â k from their fastness they betook themselves to the woods or fled to their lurking places while the Germans and Rhaetians hung upon them in their flight Several thou sands were put to the sword or sold to slavery Having ravaged the country and laid a scene of desolation the army marched to the siege of Aventicum b the capital city of the Helvetians The in habitants sent their deputies offering to surrender at discretion Their sub mission was accepted Julius Alpinus one of the leading chiefs charged with being the author of the war was by order of Caecina publicly executed The rest were left to the mercy or resentment of Vitellius LXIX The Helvetians sent their am bassadors to the new emperor but which was most implacable he or his army it is difficult to decide The soldiers clamoured for the utter destruction of the whole race They brandished their arms in the face of the ambassadors and threatened blows and brutal violence Vitellius showed no 1S8  Z HISTOEY book less ferocity He gave yentto a torrent of abuse and threw out violent menaces At length Claudius Cossus one of the depu ties who possessed an uncommon share of eloquence but had the skill under an ap pearance of well acted terror to conceal his power over the passions of his audi ence had the address to sooth the minds of the soldiers Their rage subsided and compassion took its turn Such is the na ture of the multitude easily inflamed and with a sudden transition shifting to the opposite extreme They melted into tears and never ceased their suppli cations till they prevailed on Vitellius and saved the people from destruction LXX CiEciNA wanting further in structions from Vitellius and at the same time making all proper arrangements for his passage over the Alps halted for a few days in the territory of the Helvetians In that situation he received intelligence that the squadron of horse called Sylla s squadron a at that time quartered on the banks of the Po had sworn fidelity to Vitellius They had formerly served under oi Tacitus 129 Vitelliusj when he was the proconsular book governor b of Africa Nero when he pro jected an expedition into iEgypt ordered them to sail for that country  but being soon after alarmed by the commotions stirred up by Vindex he called them back to Italy where they remained from that time Their officers unacquainted with Otho and closely connected with Vitellius espoused the interest of the latter By re presenting to the men the strength of the legions then on their march to the inva sion of Italy and by extolling the valour of the German armies they drew the whole squadron into their party As a further proof of their zeal for their new prince they attracted to his interest the chief municipal towns on the other side of the Po namely Mediolanum c Novaria Eporedia and Vercelles Of this fact Cae cina was apprised by dispatches from the officers But a single squadron he knew was not sufficient to defend so large a tract of country In order to reinforce them he sent forward the cohorts of Gaul of Lur sitania and Britain with the succours from Germany and the squadron pf hprse vol v k 130 THE HISTOR book called the ala petrina d How lie1 himself should pass into Italy was his next consideration His first plan was to march over the Rhaetian mountains e in order to make a descent into Noricum where Petronius Urbicus the governor of the province supposed to be a partisan in Otho s service was busy in collecting forces and destroying the bridges over the rivers But this enterprise was soon re linquished The detachment already sent forward might be cut off and after all the secure possession of Italy was the im portant object The issue of the war wherever decided would draw after it all inferior places and Noricum would fall by consequence into the hands of the con queror He resolved therefore to pro ceed by the shortest way into Italy For this purpose he ordered the troops lightly armed to proceed on their journey and with the legions heavily armed he marched himself over the Penine Alps  through a waste of snow and all the rigours of the winter season _  _ LXXI Otho in the mean time di OF tAClTtTSi 131 Relayed anew and unexpected character book He renounced his love of pleasure or at least dissembled for the present Scorn ing to loiter in luxury and inglorious ease he assumed a spirit becoming the majesty of empire And yet the change diffused a general terror men knew that his virtues were false and they dreaded a return of his former vices He ordered Marius Cel sus the consul elect whom he had put in irons a in order to rescue him from the hands of the soldiers to appear before him in the capitoh To acquire the fame of clemency by releasing a man of illustrious character and well known to be an enemy to Otho and his party was the object of his ambition Celsus appeared with un shaken constancy He confessed the crime of adhering faithfully to the unfortunate Galba and by that firmness gave the emperor a fair opportunity to grace his character Otho did not assume the tone of a sovereign granting pardon to a crimi nal  but to show that he could think ge nerously of an enemy and to remove all doubt of the sincerity of his reconciliation he received Celsus among his intimate t2 132 THE HISTORY friends and in a short time afterwards appointed him one of his generals to con duct the war Celsus accepted the com mission and remained steady to his trust His fidelity was honourable but unfortu nate The clemency of the prince gave great satisfaction to the leading men at Rome the populace applauded and even the soldiers admired the virtue which they had condemned LXXII The joy excited on this occa sion was followed by an event no less ac ceptable but for reasons of a different nature The public voice was loud against Sophonius Tigellinus a and accordingly his doom was fixed From low beginnings this man had raised himself to eminence in the state His birth was obscure Stained in his youth with the worst impu rities he retained in his advanced years all his early habits and closed with dis grace a life begun in infamy By his vices the surest road to preferment he obtained the command first of the city cohorts and afterwards of the praetorian guards The reward which were due to virtue only he OF TACITUS 133 obtained by his crimes To his effeminate qualities he united some of those rougher evils which may be called manly passions such as avarice and cruelty Having gained an entire ascendant over the affec tions of Nero he was in some instances the adviser of the horrors committed by that prince and in others the chief actor without the knowledge of his master He corrupted Nero at first and in the end de serted him Hence it was that the blood of a criminal was never demanded with such violent clamour The men who detested the memory of Nero and those who still regretted him concurred in one opinion They all joined in the cry for public justice During the short reign of Galba he lived secure under the protec tion of Titus Vinius In fact he had some merit with that minister having saved the life of his daughter but in that very act humanity was not his motive A man who had shed so much innocent blood could not be suspected of a single virtue His design was by a new connection to screen himself from future danger 134 THE HISTORY book Such at all times is the policy of the worst of men they dread a reverse of fortune and in the hour of need hope to shelter themselves under the protection of some pernicious favourite Innocence is no part of their care they know that the guilty are ever ready to defend each other But the friendship of Vinius who was still remembered with detestation was an additional spur to the populace They crowded together from all quarters they surrounded the palace they filled the forum and in the circus and the theatre where licentiousness is most apt to s how itself they clamoured with a degree of violence little short of sedition for the punishment of a vile malefactor Tigellir nus was then at the baths of Sinuessa b Orders were sent to him to put a period to his life He received the fatal ne s in a circle of his concubines he took leave with tenderness and after mutual enir braces and other trifling delays lie cut his throat with a razor by the pusil lanimity of his last moments disgracing pyen the infamy of his former life  â  OF TACITUS 135 LXXIII About the same time the book execution of Calvia Crispinilla a was de â â A U C manded by the public voice  but by va 822 rious artifices in which the duplicity of est the prince covered him with dishonour she was saved from danger She had been jn the reign of Nero the professed teacher of lascivious pleasures and in the various scenes of that emperor the caterer for his appetite She passed afterwards into Africa and having instigated Clodius Macer to revolt became an accomplice in the plot to cause a famine in the city of Home She wajs married soon after to a  man of consular rank and by that connection gained  powerful interest insomuch that during the reigns of Galba Otho and Yitellius she lived in perfect security Even in the following reign she was high in credit Her riches and her want of children placed her in a flourishing state and those two circum stances in good as well as evil times are sure to be of weight LXXIV Otho in the mean time en deavoured by frequent letters to djyert 136 THE HISTORY book Vitellius from his purpose His proposals were in the soft style of female persuasion he offered money and a retreat for volup tuous enjoyments with all that the prince s favour could bestow Vitellius answered in the same delicate strain Both parties corresponded in dainty terms with dis sembled hatred and frivolous negotiation till exasperated by want of success they changed their tone and with unguarded invective charged each other with crimi nal pleasures and flagitious deeds Both had truth on their sides Weary of alter cation Otho recalled the deputies who had been sent by Galba and in their room dispatched others to the German army to the Italic legion and the troops quartered at Lyons with instructions to negotiate in the name of the senate The men employed in this embassy tarried with Vitellius and by their cheerful com pliance left no room to think that they were detained by force Under pretence of doing honour to the embassy Otho had sent a detachment of the praetorian guards Without suffering them to mix with the soldiers Vitellius ordered them to return OF TACITUS 137 without delay Fabius Valens took the book opportunity to write in the name of the German army to the prastorian guards His letters in a style of magnificence set forth the strength of the legions and at the same time offered terms of mutual concord He condemned the forward zeal with which they presumed to trans fer to Otho an empire which had been vested in Vitellius He mingled promises with expressions of anger and after treat ing the praetorians as men unequal to an important war gave them assurances that they would lose nothing by peace and Unanimity These letters however were without effect The praetorians continued firm in their duty LXXV The rival chiefs began to lay snares for each other They waged a war of treachery Emissaries were sent by Otho into Germany and others by Vitel lius to Rome Both parties missed their aim The agents of yitellius passed un detected Amidst a concourse of people in so vast a city as Rome they could lurk with impunity while on the other hand 138 THE HISTORY book in a camp where all were known to each other the men employed by Otho were soon discovered by the novelty of their faces Vitellius anxious for his family then residing at Rome sent letters to Ti tianus the brother of Otho threatening if any violence was offered to his mother or his children a to make reprisals and put both him and his son to death Both fa milies remained unhurt As long as Otho lived fear might be the motive  Vitellius after his victory added to his laurels the palm of clemency LXXVI The first occurrence that in spired Otho with confidence in his cause was an account from Ulyricum that the legions of Dalmatia of Pannonia and Maesja had declared in his favour Ad vices from Spain brought the like intelli gence  and in a public edict honourable mention was made of Cluvius llufus the governor of the province That compli ment however was found to be prema ture Spain went over to the interest of Vitellius The people of Aquitaine under the influence of Julius Cordus had sworn OF TACITUS 13g obedience to Otho but a little time book showed that the obligation of an oath was no longer binding All principle all af fection and all truth were banished Fear and the necessity of the times governed in every quarter Narbon Caul acceded to Vitellius A party in force and near at hand found no difficulty in drawing their neighbours into a league with them selves The distant provinces and all places separated by the Mediterranean adhered to Otho not from motives of re gard for him or his party but because the name of Rome and the senate was still re spected by foreign nations Besides this Otho being the first announced in foreign parts had already made his impression The army in Judaea under the conduct of Vespasian and that in Syria under Mu cianus swore fidelity to Otho Bgypt and the provinces in the East acknow ledged his authority The same disposi tion prevailed in Africa That whole country was willing to follow the example set by the people of Carthage In that city without any order or authority from Vipsanius Apronianus then proconsular 4 140 THE HISTORY   book governor of the province a public treat was given by a pragmatical fellow of the name of Crescens one of Nero s freedmen who had the ambition to distinguish him self as an active partisan in the interest of Otho Such in times of public distrac tion is the presumption of the lowest men in the state They think it time to emerge from their obscurity and act their part as if they had an interest in the common wealth The mob of Carthage expressed their zeal with all demonstrations of joy and the rest of Africa followed their ex ample LXXVII In this posture of affairs while the armies and the several provinces embraced opposite interests it was evi dent that Vitellius to secure his title had nothing left but the decision of the sword Otho in the mean time remained at Rome discharging all the functions of the sovereign power as if he was established in profound tranquillity His conduct in some instances was such as became the dignity of the state but his measures for the most part were hastily adopted the OP TACITUS 141 mere expedients of the day He named book himself and his brother Titianus joint con suls a to continue in office till the ca lends of March For the two following months with a view to curry favour with the German army he appointed Vergi nius and gave him for his colleague Pop paeus Vopiscus For the nomination of the latter he pretended motives of friend ship  but as men of penetration thought his real view was to pay court to the people of Vienne With regard to future consuls no alteration was made in the arrange ment settled by Nero or by Galba Caelius Sabinus and his brother Flavius were to succeed for the months of May and June From the first of July to September At rius Antoninus b and Marius Celsus were to be in office Nor did Vitellius after his victory disturb this order of succes sion Otho at the same time thought proper to grant the augural and pontifical dignities as the summit of civil honours to such of the senators as were grown gray b public stations nor was he unmindful of the young patricians lately recalled from banishment To sooth the remem 142 tMe rtistoSY book brance of their sufferings he bestowed i upon them the sacerdotal honours which had been enjoyed by their ancestors Ca Uius Rufus c Pedius Blaesus and Saevi nus Pomtinus who under Claudius or Nero had been charged with extortion and expelled the senate were restored to their rank To varnish this proceeding the real offence was suppressed and what was in fact public rapine in the style of the pardon took the name of violated ma jesty a charge held in such general detes tation that to elude it the best and wisest laws were set aside LXXVIII In order to extend his po pularity Otho in the next place turned his thoughts to the cities and provinces little doubting but by acts of munificence he should be able to strengthen his inte rest To the colonies of Hispalis and Emerita Â then on the decline he trans planted a number of families the Lin gones were honoured with the privileges of lloman citizens avid to the province of Baetica all the Moorish cities Were an nexed He gave a new code of laws to op Tacitus 143 Cappadocia and another to Africa all book popular grants and splendid for the pre v sent but soon to fade away and sink into Â Â i oblivion Amidst these innovations all  of them temporizing acts occasioned by the pressure of his affairs and perhaps on that account excusable he did not forget his tender passions Even in the moment when the sovereign power was still at stake his love of Poppaea was not extin guished With fond remembrance of that connection he caused her statues to be restored by a decree of the senate There is reason to think that with a view to po pularity he intended to celebrate the me mory of Nero with public honours Many were for erecting the statues of that em peror 6 and even proposed it as a public measure The populace and the soldiers as if they meant to decorate their emperor witb additional splendour saluted him by the title of Nero Otiio He heard their acclamations but remained silent per haps unwilling to reject the compliment perhaps ashamed to accept it LXXIX The public mind being now 144 THE HISTORY book intent on the great scene that began to open no wonder if foreign affairs fell into neglect Encouraged by the inattention that prevailed at Rome the Rhoxolanians a people of Sarmatia who in the preced ing winter had cut off two entire cohorts made an irruption into the province of Maesia with nine thousand horse a band of freebooters determined to ravage the country Plunder and not war was their passion They prowled about in quest of prey without order or apprehension of an enemy when on a sudden they found themselves hemmed in by the third legion and their auxiliaries The Romans ad vanced in order of battle The Sarma tians overloaded with booty were taken by surprise On a damp and slippery soil the swiftness of their horses was of no use Unable to retreat they were cut to pieces more like men bound in fetter than soldiers armed for the field of battle It may seem strange but it is not less true that the courage of the Sarmatians has no inward principle but depends alto gether upon external circumstances a kind of courage that has no source in the 6 OP TACITUS 145 mind but may be said to be out of the book man In an engagement with the infan try nothing can be more dastardly in an onset of the cavalry they are impetuous fierce and irresistible Their weapons are long spears or sabres of an enormous size which they wield with both hands The chiefs Avear coats of mail formed with plates of iron or the tough hides of ani mals impenetrable to the enemy but to themselves an incumbrance so unwieldy that he Avho falls in battle is never able to rise again In their encounter with the Romans a heavy fall of rain and a sudden thaw de prived them of all advantage from the velocity of their horses  the consequence was that they were overwhelmed in a deep waste of snow The light breast plates of the Romans were no impediment With their missive weapons and their swords of a moderate length they were able to rush into the thickest ranks  while the Sarma tians who wear neither shield nor buckler were a mark at a distance or in close en gagement cut to pieces The few who vol v L 145 THE HISTORY book escaped from the slaughter fled for refuge to their fens and marshes and there died of their wounds or perished under the in clemency of the season An account of this transaction being received at Rome a triumphal statue was decreed to Marcus Aponius then governor of Maesia Ful vius Aurelius Julianus Titius and Numi sius Lupus all three commanders of le gions obtained the consular ornaments The joy expressed byOtho Avas beyond all bounds He assumed the merit of the victory boasting with vain glory that by his own auspicious fortune and the valour of his officers and his armies he had ag grandised the Roman name LXXX From a cause altogether con temptible and in its origin threatening no kind of danger a violent sedition well nigh involved the city in ruin The seven teenth cohort then quartered at Ostia had orders to remove to Rome The care of providing them with arms was commit ted to Varius Crispinus a tribune of the prcetorian baiids That officer intending to execute his orders without noise or OF TACITUS 147 bustle chose his time towards the close of day when the camp was quiet He opened the magazine of arms and ordered the waggons to be loaded The lateness of the hour filled the men with suspicion  the intention seemed dark and dangerous and the affectation of secrecy produced a general tumult The soldiers were in li quor and at the sight of their arms rea soning like drunken men they thought it their business to seize them without delay They murmured they complained they charged the tribunes and centurions with treachery declaring aloud that a dark conspiracy was formed with intention to arm the slaves and domestics of the se nators against the life of Otho A scene of uproar and confusion followed Some were stupefied with liquor and compre hended nothing the profligate liked the opportunity to commit midnight plunder and the multitude as usual were ready to mix in any sudden commotion Those who regarded discipline and good order were undistinguished in the dark The tribune who attempted to restrain their fury was murdered on the spot â The l 2 148 THE HISTORY book centurions who exerted themselves on the occasion suffered in like manner The soldiers seized their arms they mounted their horses and entering the city sword in hand rushed in a body to the imperial palace LXXXI Otiio was engaged at a grand entertainment to which he had invited the most distinguished of both sexes A sud den terror seized the whole company The cause was unknown Was it an accidental fray among the soldiers or the perfidy of the emperor What was to be done Should they stay and perish together  or was it more advisable to disperse and fly different ways  In the hurry and agita tion no one could decide They made a show of resolution  their courage failed  they stood covered with consternation and with their eyes fixed on Otho en deavoured to peruse his countenance The usual fate of suspicious minds at tended them all They were afraid  of Otho and he stood trembling for him self He trembled also for the senate and thought of their danger no less than OF TACITUS 14 of his own He ordered the two praeto book rian commanders to go forth in order to appease the tumult and in the mean time advised his company to depart They fled with precipitation The magis trates threw aside the ensigns of their of fice and dispersed without their friends without their train of attendants Old men and women of distinction wandered about in the dark they knew not whither Few dared to venture towards their own habi tations The greatest part took shelter with their friends and where the meanest of their dependants lived that place they thought the safest refuge LXXXII The madness of the soldiers was not to be controlled They burst the palace gates and rushed forward to the banqueting room with outrageous cla mour demanding a sight of Otho Julius Martialis one of the tribunes and Vitellius Saturninus the praefect of the legion en deavoured to oppose the torrent and were both wounded in the fray Nothing was to be seen but the flash of arms and nothing heard but threats and denunciations of fj 150 THE HISTORY vengeance now against the centurions and at times against t ie whole body of the senate The soldiers neither knew the cause nor the object of their phrensy and having no particular victim in view they resolved to lay a scene of general slaugh ter They forced their way into the apart ment of the prince Otho forgetting his own rank and the majesty of empire stood up on his couch with tears and sup plications imploring the soldiers to desist He prevailed at length The men retired to the camp with a sullen spirit and guilt at their hearts On the following day Rome had the appearance of a city taken by assault The houses were shut the streets deserted the populace in a general panic The soldiers wandered about in a sullen mood with looks of discontent ra ther than repentance The two praefects Licinius Proculus and Plotius Firmus went round to the several companies and harangued the men each according to his own peculiar temper in soothing terms or in a style of reproach A distribution of five thousand sesterces to each man concluded the business The tumult over OF TACITUS 131 Otho ventured to enter the camp The book tribunes arid centurions gathered round him but without the military ornaments of their rank praying to be dismissed from the service that they might retire to Jive in ease and safety The soldiers felt the request as a reproach for their own con duct Remorse and sorrow took posses sion of every mind They expressed their willingness to return to their duly and of their own motion desired to see the au thors of the insurrection brought to pu nishment LXXXI1L In this delicate conjunc ture when the tinies were big with dan ger and a discordant soldiery heightened the distraction Otho felt that he had a difficult game to play All who wished well to the service called for an imme diate reform of the army Avhile on the other hand the loose and profligate al ways the greatest number liked nothing so well as tumult and insurrections under the conduct of an ambitious leader To such minds Otho knew that the strongest motives to a civil war are the hopes of I5t THE HISTORY book growing rich by the spoils of the public j nor was he to learn that power obtained by guilt is incompatible with a new sy stem of laws and the rigour of antient man ners But still the danger that hung over the city and the Roman senate filled him with anxiety In this alarming situation he spoke to the following effect â  I come not now my fellow soldiers  to excite your zeal for me and the cause  in which we are engaged much less do  I come to add new ardour to your cou  rage Both are too well known they  need no incentive Perhaps some re straint may be necessary perhaps the  zeal that pervades you all requires a  degree of moderation In the late tu  mult it was not the love of plunder  nor ill will to any man or any set of  men that urged you on From those  motives discord and mutiny have often  broke out in various armies but upon  your conduct they had no effect Nor  was there in that transaction any fear of  danger or so much as a wish to re  nounce your duty It was your regard a 0 TACITUS 153 for me sincere indeed but generous to book  excess that hurried you on to acts of in  temperance and even violence You list  ened to your passions but not to your judgment and where judgment does not  direct and guide the best counsels and  the best cause are often ruined We are  going forth to a great and important war  And must all intelligence be communi  cated to the army  Must every secret  be disclosed And must councils of war  be held in a public assembly of the sol  diers  The reason of things and the op  portunity which must be seized at once  or lost for ever will not allow a mode  of proceeding so slow and dangerous to  the service To know some things is  the duty of the soldier in others not  to be informed is his happiness and  submission is his virtue Even the tri  bunes and centurions must often receive  their orders without a reason assigned  to know the motives that weiijh with  the general is not their province  to  obey is the duty of the inferior officer  If every subaltern may discuss the ope  rations of war and cavil with the com 1 j4 THE HISTOTtY mandcr in chief subordination ceases discipline is at an end and the best concerted enterprise may be defeated And are we now to imagine that the  soldier when the enemy is at hand  may seize his arms and as caprice or  fancy prompts sally forth in the dead  of night  Shall two or three drunken  men in the last night s fray I do not  believe there were more imbrue their  hands in the blood of their officers  Shall they murder the centurions and  in a fit of phrensy rush to the pavilion  of their general LXXXIV  You my fellow soldiers  have transgressed the bounds of your  duty the fact must be admitted but  your zeal for mc was the cause And  3Tet reflect for a moment what might  have been the consequence  Amidst  that general uproar in the gloom of  midnight darkness the assassins blow  might have been aimed at me whom  you wished to defend Give Vitellius  his option  let him and his rebel soLdiers  have the power of choosing and what OF TACITUS 155  greater curse could they invoke what book  calamity could they call down upon us  so much to be dreaded as a turbulent  and factious spirit and all the e ils of  discord and sedition  Let the soldier  refuse to obey his centurion  let the  centurion shake off the authority of the  tribune let the cavalry and the foot  soldiers be intermixed without order or  distinction and let us all in one pro  miscuous body go forward to the war  Need our enemies wish for more  We  should rush on sure destruction It is  obedience my fellow soldiers implicit  prompt obedience a without pausing  to wrangle with our superior officer that  gives to military operations all their  energy The army that shows itself in  time of peace attentive to discipline and  good order is jure to be the most for  midable in the day of battle It is yours  to arm in the cause of your country and  to face the enemy with heroic valour be  it mine to form the plan of operations  and in the execution to direct and  guide the courage of the army The  guilt of last night extends to a few only 156 v THE HISTORY book  and of those few two only shall expiate  the offence That done let us bury in oblivion the horrors of that shameful tumult and may no other army hear  those dreadful imprecations uttered  against a Roman senate  Against that  venerable body the head of the empire  and ithe fountain from which justice  flows through the provinces not even  Vitellius nor his rash levied crew of  Germans would dare to meditate so  vile a deed  And can there be in Italy a race of  men the genuine offspring of Roman  citizens who are capable of so foul a par  ricide  who can lift their impious hands  against the sacred order from whom  our cause derives so much lustre to the  confusion of Vitellius and the scum of  nations that follows him to the field   Some states it is true have been in  duced to join his standard he has the  appearance of an army but the senate  is on our side The commonwealth is  with us our enemies are the enemies  of Rome And when I mention Rome OF TACITUS 157  when you yourselves behold that mag book  nificent city do you imagine that it  consists in walls and buildings and a  pile of stones Inanimate structures and  mute and senseless edifices may moul  der away and rise again out of their  ruins  but the stability of empire de  pends upon the senate  upon the safety  of that august assembly the welfare of Si the community the peace of nations  your fate and mine are grafted It was  Romulus the founder of the city and  the father of the Roman state who  instituted with solemn auspices that  sacred order It has subsisted in vigour  from that time from the expulsion of  Tarquin to the establishment of the  Caesars it has been preserved inviolate  We received it from our ancestors let  us transmit it to our posterity unshaken  unimpaired immortal From your or  der from the people at large the senate  is supplied with its brightest ornaments  and from the senate you derive a suc  cession of princes     LXXXV This speech seasoned with 158  THE HISTORY book reproof yet tempered with conciliating v â language was favourably received  and saa  the moderation of the prince who pu AD 69 nished only two of the mutineers gave general satisfaction By that lenient mea sure the soldiers too fierce to be controll ed were quieted for the present Home however was not in a state of tranquillity A constant din of arms was heard and warlike preparations were seen in every quarter The soldiers did not as before riot in tumultuous bodies  but being di spersed throughout the city they found means  in various shapes to insinuate themselves into houses where they watch ed with sufficient malignity the motions and words of all who bjr their nobility their wealth or their talents were eminent enough to be objects of calumny A re port prevailed at the same time that Vi tellius had a number of emissaries dispersed among the populace to act as spies and watch the state of parties Hence jea lousy mistrust and fear No man thought himself safe under his own roof Abroad and under the eye of the public the alarm was still greater Whatever was the ru 7 OF TACITDS 159 mour of the day all degrees and ranks book were obliged to set their faces for the oe casion if bad they were afraid of seem ing to despond  and if propitious un willing to be thought backward in demon strations of joy With events of either kind their features were taught to comply The fathers had the hardest task Si lence in the senate might be thought sul len discontent and liberty of speech might be deemed a crime Adulation itself was at a stand Who could deceive a prince who was but latety a private man and in that station practised flattery till he be came a perfect master of that insidious art  The fathers were driven to little stra tagems  they tortured every sentence into a thousand forms and to diversify one and the same thought all the colours of rhetoric were exhausted All agreed to call Vitellius a public enemy and a parricide This was the burthen of every speech Cautious men who looked forward to their own security avoided en tering into particulars content with hack neyed declamation others without re 160 THE HISTORY book serve or management poured out a tor rent of virulent invective but generally chose to rise in the midst of noise and cla mour when nothing could be distinctly heard and the speaker could mouth and bellow without the danger of being un derstood or remembered LXXXVI A number of prodigies announced from different quarters dif fused a general panic The goddess of victory in the vestibule of the capitol let the reins of two horses harnessed to her chariot fall from her hand A form of more than human size was seen to issue from the chapel of Juno In an island in the Tiber a the statue of Julius Caesar without any apparent cause on a day per fectly serene and calm turned round from the west to the east In Etruria an ox was said to have spoken  animals brought forth monstrous births  and to these was added a variety of praeternatural appearances such as in rude and barbarous ages were the coinage of superstition and even in profound peace made an impression on vulgar credulity though of late years they OF TACITUS 161 have so far lost their effect that unless it book be a time of public distress they pass away unheeded and forgotten Amidst the omens which seemed to threaten im pending danger an inundation of the Ti ber was the most alarming The waters swelled above their banks and overflowed the adjacent country The Sublician bridge was carried away by the flood and the ruins that fell in obstructing the course of the river the torrent was driven back with such impetuous violence that not only the level parts of the city but even the higher grounds were covered with a general deluge  The people in the streets were swallowed up and numbers were drowned in their shops and in their beds The corn in the public granaries was destroyed a famine ensued and the common people were reduced to the last distress The waters that lay for some time in the streets of Rome sapped the foundation of several insulated houses and when the flood fell back into its chan nel the superstructure tumbled to the ground This disaster was no sooner over than a new occurrence spread a general vol v M 1 52 THE HlSTOfcY book terror Otho was preparing to set out on his expedition His way was over the field of Mars and the Flaminian road  but both places were impassable This circum stance though accidental or the effect of natural causes was magnified into a prodigy by which the gods denounced the slaughter of armies and a train of public calamities LXXXVII The emperor ordered a lustration a and having purified the city turned his thoughts to the conduct of the war The Penine and the Cottian Alps with all the passes into Italy were in the possession of Vitellius and his armies Otho resolved therefore to make a descent on the coast of Narbon Gaul with a fleet well manned and in force to keep the command of those seas All who sur vived the massacre at the Milvian bridge and had been by Galba s orders thrown into prison were released by Otho and incorporated with the legions He de pended on the fidelity of those men and by giving to others the like hopes of pre ferment he inspired the whole body with  2 OF TACITUS 163 eeal and ardour In order to strengthen b k k his fleet lie embarked the city cohorts and a Considerable detachment from the praetorian guards a body of men capable of defending their generals by their courage and of assisting with their advice The conduct of the marine was committed to three officers namely Antonius Novellus and Suedius Clemens both centurions of principal rank and iEmilius Pacensis a tribune degraded by Galba but since the death of that emperor restored his rank A freedman of the name of Oscus was appointed to direct the operations of the fleet and act as a spy on better men than himself The land forces both horse and infantry were put under the command of Suetonius Paulinus Marius Celsus and Annius Gallus To them was added Lici nius Proculus the praefect of the praeto rians and in him Otho reposed his whole confidence This officer in time of peace discharged the functions of his station with sufficient ability  but he had seen no service and had therefore no skill in mili tary affairs He had talents for mischief and knew how to obstruct the authority of ir 2 164 THE HISTORY book Paulinus to check the ardour of Celsus and to thwart the judgment of Gallus An enemy to every excellence of those three officers he found as usually hap pens that worth and modest merit were no match for malice and left handed po licy LXXXVIII Before Otho set out from Rome Cornelius Dolabella was by his order conveyed under a guard to the Aquinian colony a there to be kept out of the way but not in close confine ment His only crime was the antiquity of his family and his affinity to Galba Several magistrates and others of consular rank had it in command to attend Otho on his expedition not to assist in the war by their counsels or their valour but to swell the pomp of the emperor s retinue Jn the number was Lucius Vitellius who Avas suffered to mix with the rest of the train undistinguished cither as the bro ther of one emperor or the enemy or another During these preparations Home presented a scene of hurry and confusion No order of men was exempt from fear or OF TACITU8 165 danger The principal senators enfeebled by age or softened by a long peace the nobility sunk in sloth and the Roman knights who had lost their warlike spirit were all obliged to put themselves in rea diness They assumed an air of courage but their fears were seen through the vain disguise Some affected to make a di splay of their alacrity They bought with vain ostentation the most splendid ar mour horses for parade and all the conveniences of a luxurious table as if such implements were a necessary part of their camp equipage The wise and mo derate thought of nothing but their own safety and the public welfare while the vain and senseless whose views did not extend to remote consequences filled their minds with chimerical expectations and all who were bankrupts both in fame and fortune hoped to find in the distractions of their country that security which in quiet times they had never known LXXXIX The people at large unac quainted with the secrets of state and of course free from solicitude began how 166 THE HISTORY book ever to feel the ill effects of the impend ing war They saw the public revenue exhausted in the service of the army they laboured under a scarcity of provi sions and the price was rising every day whereas in the troubles stirred up by Vindex none of those inconveniences af fected the city of Rome That commotion was at a distance a war in the remote parts of Gaul decided between the legions and the provincial insurgents The Roman citizens looked on in perfect tranquillity as if it were no more than a foreign quarrel From the reign of Augustus when that em peror established the power of the Caesars this had constantly been the case The issue of every war affected the sovereign only Under Tiberius and Caligula the evils of peace were the worst calamities The attempt of Scribonianus a to shake the authority of Claudius was crushed as soon as discovered Nero was undone by rumours and vague intelligence not by force of arms In the present juncture the face of things was changed The pres sure was felt at home The fleets and le gions were in motion and beyond all ex OP TACITUS 167 ample the praetorian bands and city co book horts were obliged to take the field The east and west were engaged in the contest the several provinces which the leading chiefs left behind them were up in arms and under better generals there were ample materials for a long and difficult war Otho was now on the point of begin ning his march A scruple was started to deter him from proceeding till the cere mony of depositing the sacred shields called the ancilia b was performed with due rites and ceremonies He rejected the advice Delay had been the ruin of Nero and Caecina by this time had passed the Alps The time called for vigour and expe dition XC On the day preceding the ides of March Otho called a meeting of the senate He recommended the care of the commonwealth to the wisdom of that assembly and ordered the property of such as had been recalled from banish ment since the death of Nero to be re stored to the respective owners To this liberality nothing could be objected it 168 THE HISTORY book was an act of justice in appearance mag nificent but of little use as the public officers had already seized the whole into their own hands From the senate Otho proceeded to harangue the people he talked in a pompous style of the fathers and the majesty of the Roman citizens He mentioned the adverse party in mar naged terms imputing to the legions error in judgment rather than a turbulent and factious spirit Of Vitellius he made no mention perhaps from motives of delicacy or more probably because the writer of the speech looking forward to his own safety thought it prudent to exclude all personal invective For the last opinion there seems to be some foundation In all military operations Suetonius Paulinus and Marius Celsus were Otho s confidential advisers but in matters that concerned the civil administration Galerius Tracha lus a was the person on whose talents he relied That minister had gained repu Hion at the bar and those who were acquainted with his mode of elo  and the harmony of his copious liscovered in the composition of OF TACITUS 169 the speech the style and manner of that book celebrated orator Otho was received with acclamations the populace according to custom yielded to the impulse of the mo ment full of sound and servile adulation but nothing from the heart You would have thought that it was Caesar the dicta tor or Augustus the emperor for whom they contended with so much emulation And yet in all this show of zeal there was at the bottom neither love nor fear servility was the motive all courted the yoke and all rushed headlong into slavery The public at this time presented no better spectacle than what is seen every day in a family of domestic slaves each individual had his own private views and for the public interest or the honour of the state no care remained Otho was now ready to depart he left the govern ment of Rome and the whole weight of empire to his brother Salvius

was already preparing in book another quarter of the world to open an important scene and to produce to mankind a new imperial family destined at first a to flourish in prosperity and in the end after a disastrous reign to fall by a dreadful catastrophe While Galba still possessed the sovereign power Titus by order of Vespasian his father set out from Judaea with congratulations to that emperor and as was natural with the ambition of a young man eager to begin the career b of public honours The com mon people according to their custom n2 180 THE HISTORY book found deeper reasons for the journey Titus they believed was to be adopted heir to the empire and what they believed they took care to circulate The advan ced age of Galba and his want of issue gave colour to the story and the busy spirit of the populace relied on vain con jecture impatient to decide what still re mained in suspense The character and personal accomplishments of Titus added weight to the report He had talents for the highest station and to the dignity of his stature united a graceful mien and ami able countenance The success that at tended the exploits of the father threw a lustre round the son t oracular responses c foretold the grandeur of the family and while the minds of men stood ready for the reception of every rumour even tri fling incidents the mere result of change7 confirmed the popular opinion At Co rinth in Achaia Titus received intelligence of the death of Galba and at the same time undoubted assurances that Vitel lius at the head of powerful armies was in motion to claim the empire In this posture of affairs he called a council of OF TACITUS 181 select friends The conjuncture was alarm ing and to choose among difficulties was all that was left  If he proceeded on his  way to Rome the homage intended for  a prince now no more would have no  merit with his successor and to remain  a hostage in the custody of Otho or Vi  tellius would most probably be his  lot On the other hand if he returned M to Judaea that cold indifference would  give umbrage to the conqueror and yet  while the issue of the war Mas still un  certain the conduct of a young man  would admit of alleviating circumstances  in the opinion of the prince whom  Vespasian should think proper to join  Above all it was possible that Ves  pasian might declare himself a can  didate in that case petty offences  would be of little consequence when all  were to be involved in a general war II After balancing the motives on every side and fluctuating for some time between opposite passions hope at length prevailed and Titus returned to Judeea A change so sudden was by some impu 182 THE HISTORY book ted to his love of queen Berenice a It is true that princess had engaged his af fections  but the business of his heart never interfered with the duties of his station Youth being the season of pleasure Titus gave a loose to those desires which he afterwards so well knew how to regulate In his own reign he was remarkable for that self control which he never prac tised under his father He set sail from Corinth and after steering along the coast of Achaia and Asia which lay to the left he directed his course towards Rhodes and Cyprus From those islands he went by a more bold navigation 6 across the Open sea to the coast of Syria At Cyprus cu riosity led him to visit the temple of the Paphian Venus famous for the worship paid by the inhabitants and the conflux of strangers who resorted thither from all parts If we take this opportunity to trace the origin of that singular worship c and to describe the situation of the temple and the form of the Goddess differing en tirely from what is seen in any other place the digression will perhaps be neither tedious nor unacceptable to the reader OF TACITUS 183 III The founder of the temple if we book believe antient tradition was king A eri as  a name ascribed by some writers a to the goddess herself According to a more re cent opinion the temple was built and dedicated by king Cinyras b on the spot where the goddess after emerging from her native waves was gently wafted to the shore The science ofâ divination we are told was of foreign growth imported by Thamiras c the Cilician and by him established with mysterious rites and cere monies In consequence of this institu tion it was settled by mutual compact between the priest and Cinyras the king of the island that the sacerdotal func tion should be hereditary in the descen dants of their respective families In pro cess of time the race of Thamiras willing that the sovereign should be distinguished by a superior prerogative resigned into the hands of Cinyras the whole conduct of the mysteries of which their ancestors were the original founders A priest of the royal line is at present the only per son consulted For victims to be offered as a sacrifice animals of every species are 184 THE HISTORY book allowed at the option of the votarist pro vided he chooses from the male kind only Discoveries made in the fibres of kids are deemed the best prognostics The altar is never stained with blood and though ex posed to the open air never moistened d by a drop of rain Supplications and the pure flame of fire are the only offerings The statue of the goddess bears no resem blance to the human form You see a round figure broad at the base but grow jng fine by degrees till like a cone it les sens to a point The reason e what ever it be is not explained IV Tit us viewed the wealth of the temple the presents of eastern kings and the collection of rarities which the genius of the Greeks fond of tradition and the der corations of fabulous narrative affected tQ trace from remote antiquity He then consulted the oracle about his future voyage A palm seq and a safe passage were promised He slew a number of victims and in terms properly guarded attempted to pry into his own destiny The priest whose narne was Sostratus or tac itu J85 explored the entrails of various animals iooÂ and finding that the goddess was propi tious answered for the present in the usual style but afterwards at a secret interview laid open a scene of glory Titus with a mind enlarged and swelling with vast ideas proceeded on his voyage and joined his father The armies and provinces of the East were at that time wavering but Jthe presence of Titus in spired them with vigour and alacrity Vespasian had almost brought the Jewish war to a conclusion Nothing remained tut the siege of Jerusalem Â an arduous enterprise which threatened great toil and difficulty not on account of the strength pr resources of the enemy but by reason of a hill almost inaccessible and what was till more hard to conquer the stubborn genius of superstition Vespasian as already mentioned had three legions under his command all inured to the ser vice and eager against the enemy Mu cianus in a province where profound tranquillity was established was at the head of four legions not as usual in tiiae of peace relaxed in indolence but 186 THE HISTORY book animated by the gallant exertions of the army under Vespasian and fired with a spirit of emulation Having no enemy to oppose they were not made soldiers in the field but their spirit was roused and being unimpaired by fatigue they were ready for a vigorous campaign The two commanders had an additional force of auxiliary horse and foot besides a naval armament on the coast and the support of all the neighbouring kings Add to this their own military character was a tower of strength Both stood high in re putation but for different reasons and for qualities peculiar to each V Vespasian possessed all the requi sites that form a soldier and an officer Prompt and zealous in the service he was often seen at the head of a march  he went in person to mark out the ground of his camp and by night as well as day he kept the enemy in a constant alarm planning his measures with judgment and executing with vigour To his diet he paid no regard content with whatever came before him In his apparel plain and OF TACITUS 187 simple he was scarce distinguished from book the common men With all this he had vâ vâ a leaven of avarice Forgive that vice Â w A D and he was equal to the best generals of Â Â â antiquity Mucianus was of a different cast Rich and magnificent he appeared with an air of elevation above the rank of a private citizen An able orator and versed in civil business he laid his schemes with judgment the politician appeared in all his measures In the two men was seen a rare assemblage of extraordinary qualities By weeding out the vices of each and uniting their virtues the commonwealth would have had an accomplished prince Situated as they were in contiguous provinces Ves pasian in Judaea and Mucianus in Syria they beheld each other for some time with the jealousy of rivals The death of Nero put an end to their dissensions From that time they began to act in con cert Their mutual friends made the first advances towards a reconciliation and by the address of Titus a mere cessation of animosities was turned into a lasting 188 THE HISTORY book peace The power of winning the affec tions of menwas in an eminent degree the talent of that young officer Nature and art conspired to render him acceptable to all and even Mucianus could not resist his influence The tribunes the centu rions and the common men were by va rious artifices fixed in the interest of the two commanders The diligent met with encouragement the licentious with induk gence and according to the bent of each man s disposition all were secured by their virtues or their vices VI Before the arrival of Titus both armies had sworn fidelity to Otho with the precipitation of men who had quick intelligence of all that passed at Rome They were not in that juncture ripe for a revolt Preparations for a civil war are in their nature slow and difficult The East had been composed by a long peace and now for the first time began to think of mixing in the feuds that shook the empire They had hitherto seen the convulsions of the state at a distance only The quarrel always broke out in Gaul or Italy and OF TACITUS 189 ii tf as there decided by the forces of the b o o k West It is true that Pompey Cassius Brutus and Anthony carried the war across the Mediterranean and had reason to repent Syria and Judaea heard of the Caesars but seldom saw them The legions undisturbed by sedition had no war upon their hands Embroiled at dif ferent times with the Parthians a they had a few slight conflicts with doubtful success and passed the rest of the year in profound tranquillity In the late civilâ war b when every part of the empire was in motion the East was perfectly quiet Galba obtained the sovereignty and the oriental legions acquiesced but it was no sooner known that Otho and Vitellius were engaged in an impious war against their country than they began to shake off their pacific temper They saw the supreme authority in the hands of other armies who granted it away at their own pleasure and reaped the profits of every revolution while the soldiers of the East had nothing but a change of servitude condemned at the will of others to submit to new masters 190 THfi HISTORY book Discontent and loud complaints were it  â vâ heafd throughout the army The common 822 men began to survey their strength and ea numbers They reckoned seven legions c besides a large body of auxiliaries Syria and Judtea were in their possession jEgypt had two legions at their service Cappadocia and Pontus afforded ample resources and the forces that lined the frontier of Armenia stood ready at their beck Asia and the rest of the provinces were provided with men and money In a word the islands and the sea that sur rounds them were under their command and the Mediterranean while it separated them from the rest of the empire left them at leisure to prepare for war VII The zeal of the soldiers was no secret to the commanders in chief but they judged it best to wait the issue of the war in Europe  aware that between the victor and the vanquished a sincere coali tion never can succeed and whether for tune favoured the arms of Otho or Vitel lius the consequence in cither event would be the same And if the pride of victory OP TACITtJS ljjl h apt to corrupt the ablest generals from book the present chiefs what was to be expected  Their own vices would destroy them Dis cord sloth and luxury would be the ruin of both  one would be undone by the fate of war and the other by success For these reasons it was agreed to suspend all military operations Vespasian and Mu cianus lately reconciled to each other concurred in this opinion which had been beforehand adopted by their friends Men of principle gave their advice with a view to the public good others looked for their own private advantage and public con fusion was the only resource of such as in their domestic affairs saw nothing but distress and ruin One mind one spirit pervaded the whole army Good and evil motives conspired and for different rea sons war became the passion of all VIII About this period of time a re port that Nero was still alive and actually on his way to the provinces of the East excited a general alarm through Achaia and Asia The accounts of that emperor s death a had been so various that con 192 xtit fclsfoit book jecture had ample materials Hefted nufn bers asserted that Nero survived the fury of his enemies and they found credulity ready to believe them In the course of this work the reader will hear of various pretenders and the fate that attended them The impostor who now took upon him to personate that emperor was a slave from Pontus or according to some wri ters a freedman from Italy who played with skill on the harp and had a musical voice With those talents and a counte nance that resembled Nero he was able to impose on vulgar minds By the force of promises he drew to his party a number of deserters whom their poverty induced to lead a vagrant life With this crew he put to sea but was thrown by adverse winds on the isle of Cythnus At that place he fell in with a party of soldiers on â their return from the East Some of these he listed and such as refused he ordered to be put to death Having plundered the merchants and armed the stoutest of their slaves he endeavoured to seduce Sisenna a centurion from Syria who hap pohed teland on the island of Cythnus on 3 OF TACITUS 193 his way to greet the praetorian bands in book the name of the Syrian army and in token of friendship to present two right hands clasping each other Apprehending danger from so bold an adventurer Si senna made his escape from the island A general panic seized the inhabitants Numbers rejoiced to find the name of Nero once more revived and hating the new system wished for nothing so much as another revolution IX The fame of this pretended Nero gained credit every day when by a sud den accident the illusion vanished It happened that Calpurnius Asprenas whom Galba had appointed governor of Galatia and Pamphylia arrived on his way to those provinces at the isle of Cj thnus Avith two galleys from the fleet that lay at Misenum The commanders of the ships were summoned in the name of Nero to attend their lawful prince The impostor continued to act his part He received the naval officers with an air of dejection and by the duty which they owed him implored their assistance and safe con vol v o 194 THE HISTORY II book duct either to Syria or to iEgypt The masters of the galle3rs alarmed at the pro posal or intending to deceive desired time to prepare the minds of their sailors faithfully promising to return without de lay Asprenas duly informed of all that passed gave orders to attack the impos tor and his crew of adherents The ship was seized and the pretended emperor whoever he was suffered death The air of the man his eyes his hair and the ferocity of his countenance a bore a strong resemblance to Nero His body was conveyed to Asia and afterwards sent to Rome X In a city distracted by internal discord and after so many revolutions fierce with a spirit of liberty that led to the wildest anarchy no transaction how ever trifling in itself could pass without exciting violent commotions Vibius Cris pus a man for his wealth his power and his talents always ranked among the most eminent citizens but never for his virtues numbered with the good cited to the bar of the senate Annius Faustus a Roman 6 OF TACITUS 195 knight and in the reign of Nero an in book former by profession In the beginning of Galba s reign it was ordained by a decree that all causes against the race of public accusers should be fairly heard This law however salutary was forced to yield to the temper of the times it was enforced or relaxed as the person accused happened to be of weight and consequence or poor and friendless  it was notwithstanding still in force and Crispus availing him self of it exerted all his influence to ruin the man who had been the prosecutor of his brother a In the senate his party was strong and powerful Without hear ing the criminal the fathers were for con demning him to immediate execution The violence of this proceeding stirred up an opposition A party was formed against the overgrown power of the prosecutor They insisted that the specific charge should be exhibited and a day fixed when the delinquent however guilty should be allowed the common right of being heard in his defence This motion was carried and the hearing of the cause was adjourned for a few days The trial o 2 1 X THE HISTWY book at length came on and Faustus was con it demned but not with that universal as sent of the people which a life of iniquity might have warranted The accuser it was well known had been concerned in the conduct of prosecutions and received the profits of his trade Men rejoiced to see the punishment of a crime so dangerous and detestable  but the triumph of a no torious offender gave disgust XI Meanwhile the affairs of Otho wore a favourable aspect The armies in Dalmatia and Pannonia were on their march to join him A detachment of two thousand advanced by rapid marches while the main body followed at moderate di stances The legions that composed this force were the seventh which had been raised by Galba the eleventh the thir teenth and fourteenth all veterans in the service and the last in great renown for the vigour with which they quelled the insurrection in Britain a and still more famous for the choice made by Nero who had selected that corps as the best in the empire They remained to the last faith OF TACITUS 197 ful to that emperor and after his death book declared with equal zeal in favour of Otho Knowing their own strength they Avere inspired with confidence but a confidence that made them judge for themselves and proceed on their march by slow journeys as their humour prompted The cavalry and auxiliary cohorts came forward with more alacrity The troops that marched from Rome were a formidable body They consisted of five praetorian cohorts several squadrons of horse and the first legion To these were added two thousand gladiators a resource altogether ignoble but in civil commotions often employed by generals of the first reputation Annius G alius and Vestricius Spurinna b were sent at the head of this whole force with orders to take post on the banks of the Po The first intention was to keep the enemy locked up in Gaul but that project proved abor tive Caecina having already passed the Alps Otho followed with a select body of the praetorian guards and all the vete rans of that corps with the city cohorts 198 THE HISTORY and a prodigious number draughted from the marines On the march he betrayed no symptom of sloth c no passion for luxury  he advanced on foot at the head of the colours covered with an iron breastplate rough and soldier like exhi biting a striking contrast to his former character XII In this posture of affairs fortune seemed to open a flattering prospect Otho was master of the greatest part of Italy and his fleets had the command of the sea To the foot of the maritime Alps a the country was in his possession To pass over those mountains and make a descent on Narbon Gaul was the measure which he had projected To conduct that expe dition he appointed Suedius Clemens An tonius Novellus and iEmilius Pacencis The last was loaded with irons by his own soldiers Antonius Novellus lost all au thority  and Suedius Clemens proud of his rank but not knowing how to maintain it yielded too much to the humours of the men He preserved no discipline and yet was eager for action His army pre OF TACITUS  199 sented no appearance of men marching book through their own country They forgot that Italy was their native soil and that the lands and houses belonged to their fel Jow citizens Regardless of the Roman name they laid waste the country with fire and sword they pillaged destroyed and plundered as if the war had been in a foreign realm against the enemies of their country The wretched inhabitants were oppressed by men against whom having entertained no fear they had prepared no defence The fields were covered with grain and cattle the houses were open and the owners with their wives and chil dren went forth in the simplicity of their hearts to meet the army In the midst of peace they were surrounded with all the horrors of Avar Marius Maturus was at that time governor of the mari time Alps He resolved to dispute the passage with Otho s troops and for that purpose armed the youth of the country In the first encounter the mountaineers were either cut to pieces or put to the rout A band of rustics suddenly levied and ignorant of military discipline could 200 THE HISTORY book not make head against a regular army â i  Expecting no fame from victory they 822  feared no disgrace irom an ignominious A D 69 flight XIII An opposition so rash and fee ble served only to exasperate the Otho nian soldiers They fell with fury upon Albium Intemelium a municipal town The late victory was a fruitless advantage affording neither spoil nor plunder The peasants had no property and their arms were of no value Even prisoners of war could not be made The fugitives knew the course of the country and were too swift of foot Enraged at the disappoint ment the soldiers wreaked their vengeance on the innocent inhabitants of Inteme lium and glutted their avarice with the effects of innocent men Amidst the bar barities committed on this occasion a Li gurian woman gave a noble example of courage and maternal affection She had concealed her child from the fury of the slaughtering sword The soldiers fully persuaded that she had deposited her treasure in the same place stretched her OP TACITUS Â 01 on the rack and pressed the unhapy mo iook ther to tell where she had secured her son She laid her hand on her womb and  here she said  here my child is shel  tered From that moment unmoved by menaces and unsubdued by torture she never changed her tone Nothing could conquer that generous obstinacy She died a bright example of undaunted virtue XIV Meanwhile Fabius Valens re ceived intelligence that Otho s fleet was hovering on the coast of Narbon Gaul with intent to invade that province which had already embraced the interest of Vitellius The adjacent colonies by their deputies sued for protection Valens dispatched two Tungrian cohorts four squadrons of horse with the whole cavalry of the Tie viri under the command of Julius Glassi cus reserving however a sufficient de tachment from those forces to garrison the port of Forojulium that the colony might not while the troops marched up the country lie exposed to sudden incur sions from the fleet This arrangement 202 THfe HISTORY book being made Classicus marched in quest of the enemy at the head of twelve troops of horse and a select body from the co horts To these were added the Ligurian cohort which had been usually quartered at Forojulium and five hundred men from Parinonia not yet ranged in companies under distinct and regular colours Nei ther side declined an engagement The disposition made by Otho s officers was as follows A body of marines intermixed with the peasantry took post on the heights near the sea The level space between the hills and the coast was occupied by the praetorian soldiers  and to support them the fleet stood in close to the shore drawn up in order of battle and present ing a formidable line The strength of the Vitellians consisting in cavalry was stationed in front the infantry close em bodied in their rear and their Alpine mountaineers on the ridge of the neigh bouring hills The Treverian squadrons began the attack with less skill than cou rage The veterans of Otho s army re ceived the attack in front while their OF TACITUS 203 peasants from the high grounds discharg ed a volley of stones and being expert slingers annoyed the enemy in flank They mixed in the lines with the regular soldiers and performed feats of valour In the moment of victory there was no dis tinction between the coward and the brave all pursued their advantage with equal ar dour The Vitellians were thrown into disorder and being driven towards the margin of the sea they were there attack ed in the rear by the soldiers belonging to the fleet This was a danger unforeseen Hemmed in on every side they must have been to a man cut off if the night had not come on in time to favour their retreat and restrain the victorious army from pur suing them in their flight XV The Vitellians though defeated still retained their warlike spirit With a reinforcement drawn together in haste they returned to the charge and finding the enemy elate with joy and by success lulled into security they assaulted the outposts put the advanced guard to the sword and forced their way into the 204 THE HISTORY book camp The Othonians were struck with terror and near the fleet all was tumult and disorder The surprise however soon began to subside The Othonians betook themselves to an adjacent hill and having there collected their strength rushed down with impetuous fuiy A dreadful slaugh ter followed The Tungrian cohorts stood the brunt of the action till their com manding officers fell under a shower of darts The Othonians conquered but their victory was dearly bought They pursued the flying enemy with more rage than prudence when the Treverian ca valry wheeling round attacked them in the rear and put a large party to the sword From this time the two armies remained inactive As if a truce had taken place and both sides had agreed by compact to suspend hostilities and no more molest each other by sudden incursions the Vitellians retired to Antipolis a mu nicipal town of Narbon Gaul and the Othonians to Albingaunum in the inland part of Liguria XVI Corsica Sardinia and the rest OP TACITUS 205 of the islands in those seas were over awed by the victorious fleet and kept in subjection to Otho Corsica indeed suf fered a sudden convulsion from the teme rity of the governor The name of this officer was Decimus Pacarius Though the island in a war carried on by such powerful adversaries was of no impor tance he endeavoured to seduce the in habitants to the interest of Vitellius The project which would have decided no thing ended in his own ruin He sum moned a council of the leading men and communicated his design Claudius Phir ricus who commanded the galleys on that station and Quinctius Certus a Roman knight objected to the measure and were put to instant death The rest of the as sembly terrified by this act of violence swore fidelity to Vitellius The populace as usual blind and ignorant but by con tagion catching the fears of others fol lowed the example of the leading chiefs Pacarius began to muster his men and train them to the use of arms A race of rude and vulgar peasants who had no re lish for the fatigue of military discipline 206 THE HISTORY II book began to consider the nature of their situation and their inability to support a war  They were islanders remote from  Germany and out of the reach of the  legions The fleets of Otho commanded  the seas and had lately ravaged the  maritime countries though defended by  the cohorts and cavalry of Vitellius This reflection produced a sudden change in every mind They resolved to assert their independance not with open force but by covert stratagem and for that purpose to lie in wait for their opportu nity Pacarius as soon as his train of vi sitors left him retired to his bath In that moment the conspirators fell upon him naked and disarmed He was put to in stant death and his attendants suffered the same fate Their heads like those of traitors were conveyed to Otho And yet the assassins were neither rewarded by that prince nor punished by Vitellius In the mass of atrocious deeds that dis graced the times petty villanies were suf fered to pass with impunity XVII The cayalry called the Syla OF TACITUS 207   I ntan squadron hady as already men tioned a forced their way into Italy and there fixed the seat of war In the con duct of these men nothing proceeded from principle They had no regard for Otho nor so much as a wish to serve Vitellius  but their vigour being relaxed by a long peace and their minds debased and pre pared for slavery they stood ready to stretch their necks to the yoke whatever hand imposed it in their choice of a mas ter wholly indifferent The fairest portion of Italy b extending from the Po to the Alps with all its fertile plains and flou rishing cities was in the possession of Vi tellius  the forces sent forward by Caecina having already penetrated into that quar ter At Cremona a Pannonian cohort laid down their arms  and between Placentia and Ticinum a party of a hundred horse with a thousand marines were made pri soners In this tide of success nothing could withstand the vigour of the Vitel lians The Po opposed its stream and its banks in vain To the Batavians and the troops from beyond the Rhine the river was no more than a new motive to 208 TIIE HISTORY book inflame their ardour They passed ovet with their usual rapidity under the walls of Placentia and in sight of the enemy Having gained a footing on the land they intercepted the enemy s scouts and spread such a general panic that all who escaped their fury fled with precipitation an nouncing the arrival of Caecina and his whole army XVIII Spurinna who commanded at Placentia was well informed of Caeci na s motions He knew him to be still at a distance  and if at any time he should show himself before the place he had taken his measures Three praetorian co horts and no more than a thousand vexil laries with a small body of horse would be ill opposed to a veteran army He re solved therefore to remain within his for tifications But an unruly soldiery fierce and unskilled in military operations was not to be restrained They seized the co lours and sallied forth in a body The general endeavoured in vain to check their violence the men pointed their weapons at his breast they spurned at the tribunes 3 6 tacitus 209 and centurions who extolled the wisdom ef their superior officer they rejected all advice declaring aloud that treason was at work  they were betrayed  and Caecina was invited to take possession of the place Spurinna was obliged to yield to this sud den phrensy and even to proceed on the march He went forth against his will but with a show of approbation in hopes if the sedition died away that he might then resume his former authority XIX The soldiers pushed on with spiritj till the Po appearing in sight and night coming on they halted for the first timei It was now judged necessary to fortify a camp Labour and castrameta tion were new to men who had only served within the walls of Rome Their ferocity abated and they began to see their error The veterans in the service condemned their own credulity and pointed out to their comrades the common danger of all if Caecina with a numerous army had come up in time to surround them in a wide champaign country Throughout the ranks nothing was heard but penitence vol v p 210 THE HISTORY book and submission The tribunes and cen turions regained their influence and all were loud in praise of their general who had with judgment chosen a strong and powerful colony for the seat of war Spu rinna seized his opportunity choosing ra ther to convince by reason than to irritate by reproof Having quelled the sedition he left some flying parties to watch the motions of the enemy and with an army now disposed to obey his orders marched back to Placentia The fortifications of the place were repaired  new works were added  toAvers were constructed the sol diers were provided with arms and what was of greater moment a spirit of disci pline and prompt obedience was diffused through the army This was no doubt an essential service Want of courage could not be imputed to Otho s part Inattention to their superior officers was the disadvantage under which they la boured XX C ecina advanced into Italy with a well conducted army observing in his march the strictest discipline as if on the OF TACITUS 211 Other side of the Alps he had left his cruelty and love of plunder His dress gave offence to the colonics through which he passed His mantle decorated with various colours passed for a mark of ar rogance  and his drawers a used only by savage nations did not agree with the ideas of a Roman citizen Besides this the splendid appearance of his wife Salo nina mounted on a superb horse adorned with purple ornaments though in itself a matter of no importance and certainly in jurious to no person whatever was held to be a public insult Such is the nature of the human mind disposed at all times to behold with jealousy the sudden elevation of new men and to demand that he who has been known in a humble station should know how to rise in the world with temper and modest dignity Caecina passed the Po and by negotiation and artful promises endeavoured to seduce the leaders of Otho s party The like insi dious game was played against himself Both sides talked of peace and concord but they amused each other with words of specious sound importing nothing Tired p2 212 THE HISTORY book of fruitless artifices Caecina began to con cert his measures for the reduction of Placentia He determined to invest the place and knowing how much the fame of the genera and by consequence the events of war depend on the first exploit he made every preparation to carry on the siege with vigour XXI The first approach to the town displayed the bravery but nothing of the skill which might be expected from a veteran army The soldiers intoxicated with liquor advanced to the foot of the walls without shelter or due precaution In this attack a magnificent amphithea tre which stood on the outside of the for tifications was set on fire and levelled to the ground Whether this was occasioned by the flaming brands and other combus tibles thrown in by the besiegers or by the like missive weapons discharged from the works cannot now be ascertained The vulgar herd of the city apt and will ing like the populace in every quarter to believe whatever malignity can invent im puted the disaster to the neighbouring co 8 OF TACITUS 213 lonists who saw with envy a spacious and book magnificent structure that surpassed every â  monument of art and labour throughout 82J A D Italy The sense of this misfortune how 69 ever begun was lost in the pressure of im mediate danger but the enemy was no sooner withdrawn from the walls than the inhabitants in the moment of security lamented the loss of their amphitheatre as the worst calamity that could befall them Caecina was repulsed with considerable loss The night on both sides was em ployed in necessary preparations The Vi tellians provided themselves with moving penthouses and other Avarlike machines under which the men might advance to sap the foundation of the walls The be sieged were busy in preparing stakes and rafts of timber with huge heaps of stone and lead and brass in order to crush the assailants under their own works Both armies felt every motive that could rouse their valour The love of glory and the fear of shame throbbed in every breast In the camp of the Vitellians nothing was heard but the vigour of the legions and the fame of the German armies within 214 THE HISTORY book the town the honour of the city cot horts and the dignity of the praetorian bands were the topics that inflamed their minds with heroic ardour They consi i dered the Vitellians as a set of desperate adventurers and despised them as Barba rians foreigners and aliens in Italy while in their turn they were held in contempt by the besiegers as a weak enervate band who had lost every warlike principle in the circus and the theatres of Rome Otho and Vitellius were the subject of alternate praise and calumny but praise was soon exhausted and forabuse each party found abundant materials XXII At the return of day the city and the country round displayed a scene of warlike preparation the walls and ramparts were covered with Othonian sol diers and the fields glittered with the blaze of hostile arms The legions in close array advanced to the assault and the auxiliaries in separate divisions The at tack began with a volley of stones and darts aimed at the highest part of the for tifications  and where the works were OF TACITUS  215 either impaired by time or thinly manned book the Vitellians attempted a scalade The German auxiliaries rending the air with their savage war songs and according to the custom of their country waving their shields over their shoulders advanced with impetuous fury while the garrison with deliberate aim discharged a volley of stones and darts In the mean time the legionary soldiers under their covered waj7 battered the foundation of the walls and having thrown up mounds of earth attempted to force the gates A pile of massy stones which had been prepared by the besieged was instant v rolled down with prodigious ruin the Vitellians crushed under the weight or transfixed with darts lay wounded maimed and mangled at the foot of the ramparts Horror and confusion followed The Othonians were inspired with fresh cou rage The slaughter increased and the assailants finding all their efforts defeated with great precipitation and no less dis honour sounded a retreat Chechia saw the folly of an enterprise rashly under taken To avoid further disgrace he re ii 216 THE HISTORY book solved to raise the siege and leave a camp where he had nothing to expect but re proach and shame He repassed the Po and bent his inarch towards Cremona He had not proceeded far when he was joined by Turullius Cerealis a centurion of principal rank who had served under him in Germany and also by Julius Bri ganticus a Batavian by birth the former deserted with a strong body of marine soldiers and the latter with a small party of horse XXHI Spurinna as soon as he was informed of the movements of the enemy sent dispatches to Annius Gall us with the particulars of the siege the gallant defence of Placentia and the measures concerted by Caecina Galius was then on his march at the head of the first legion to the relief of the place little imagining that a few cohorts would be able to hold out against the strength and valour of the German army It was however no sooner known that Caecina had abandoned his enterprise and was then proceeding to Cremona than the spirit of the legion blazed out at once OF TACITUS 217 They desired to be led against the enemy book Their impatience rose to a pitch little short of sedition It was with difficulty that Galius appeased the tumult He made halt at Bedriacum a a village si tuated between Verona and Cremona and unhappily famous for the slaughter of two Roman armies About the same time the Othonians gained a second advantage over the enemy Marti us Macer fought with success near Cremona That officer with the spirit of enterprise that distinguished him embarked the gladiators on the Po and making a sudden descent on the op posite bank fell with fury on the auxilia ries of Vitellius All who attempted to make head against him were put to the sword the rest fled with precipitation to Cremona Macer was not willing to lose by rashness the fruit of his victory He knew that by the arrival of fresh forces the fortune of the day might be changed and for that reason recalled his men from the pursuit This measure spread a gener ral discontent amongst the soldiers It was the misfortune of Otho s party to be on all occasions infected with suspicion 218 THE HISTORY book and with a strange perversity to put the worst construction on the conduct of their officers The base of heart and petulant of tongue combined together and with virulent invective defamed and blackened every character without distinction Even Annius Gallus Suetonius Paulinus and Marius Celsus three eminent generals did not escape the shafts of calumny They were charged with various crimes But the murderers of Galba were the worst in cendiaries Conscious of their guilt and finding no respite from remorse and fear these miscreants made it their business to embroil to distract and throw every thing into confusion They gave vent to their seditious designs with open insolence and by clandestine letters infused their venom into the mind of Otho a mind too sus ceptible always hearkening to every ma lignant whisper and only guarded against men of worth and honour in prosperity weak and irresolute in distress collected firm determined misfortune made him a better man In his present situation easily alarmed and suspecting all his offi cers he sent to Rome for his brother Ti OF TACITUS 219 iianus and committed to him the whole book h conduct of the war The interval was A U C filled by Celsus and Paulinus with active 822 enterprise and brilliant success 69 XXIV Case in a felt the disgrace of his late defeat and saw with anxiety the fame of his army mouldering away He had been roughly handled at Placentia his auxiliaries were cut to pieces and in every skirmish not worthy of a particular detail the enemy had the advantage He likewise knew by sure intelligence that Valens was advancing with his army and that commander might reap the laurels of the war To prevent a circumstance so humiliating he resolved with more cou rage than judgment to redeem his glory With this intent he marched to a village called Castorum a distant about twelve miles from Cremona At that place in a wood that overhangs the road he station ed the flower of his auxiliaries in ambus cade His cavalry had orders to take an advanced post and after provoking an engagement to give ground at once and draw the enemy forward till an unex 220 THE HISTORY book pected sally could be made from the woods The stratagem was betrayed to the generals of Otho s army Paulinus took the command of the infantry while Celsus led on the cavalry Their men were ranged in order of battle In the left wing were placed the vexillaries of the thirteenth legion four auxiliary co horts and five hundred horse The high road was occupied by three praetorian co horts who formed the centre The left wing consisted of the first legion two auxiliary cohorts and five hundred horse Besides these a thousand of the cavalry selected from the praetorian and auxiliary bands were kept as a body of reserve to support the broken ranks or if the enemy gave way to rush on at once and complete the victory XXV Before the two armies came to action the Vitellians feigned a flight Aware of the stratagem Celsus checked the ardour of his men and in his turn pretended to give ground The adverse party as they lay in ambush thought they saw their opportunity and rushing forward OF TACITUS 221 inconsiderately fell into a snare The le gions flanked them from both wings the cohorts attacked in front and the caval ry wheeling round with rapidity charged in the rear Suetonius Paulinus still kept his infantry out of the engagement By his natural temper slow and deliberate he chose to take his measures with precau tion rather than hazard a sudden conflict and owe his success to the chance of war He ordered the hollows to be filled up the ground to be cleared and his ranks to be extended wisely judging that it would then be time to think of victory when he had taken care not to be conquered During this delay the Vitellians seized the opportunity to shift their ground They betook themselves to the adjacent vine yards thick with interwoven branches and by consequence difficult of access Having there and in a wood that lay conti guous found a safe retreat they recovered their courage and sallied out to attack the praetorian cavalry The best and bravest officers of that corps were cut to pieces Epiphanes a the eastern king who in support of Otho s cause faced 222 THE HISTORY book every danger was wounded in the engage ment XXVI At length the infantry under the command of Paulinus entered into the action The front line of the enemy gave way at once and the parties that came to support them were in like manner put to the rout Caecina had not the judgment to act with his whole strength at once He brought up his men in de tachments  and the consequence was that coming forward in succession and no where strong enough they soon gave way and fled with the ranks already broken During this confusion a violent tumult broke out in Caecina s camp The soldiers were enraged that the whole army was not drawn out They seized Julius Gratus the praefect of the camp and loaded him with irons on a suspicion that he held secret intelligence with his brother Julius Fronto at that time a tribune in Otho s army and under a similar accusa tion then confined in prison by the ad verse party Nothing now could equal me disorder and consternation that cover 2 OF TACITUS 223 ed the whole Vitellian army In the camp book in the field of battle in the flight and amongst the parties that came to support the fugitives the confusion was such that if Paulinus had not sounded a retreat it was the general opinion that Coecina with his whole army might have been cut to pieces In defence of his conduct Pau linus answered that seeing how much toil and labour still remained he was not willing to expose his men already spent with the fatigue of the day to fresh forces kept in reserve and ready to issue from the adverse camp An exhausted soldiery might in that case be overpowered and if once broken no post no station re mained behind With this reasoning the judicious few were satisfied but in the lower ranks of the army discontent and murmuring still prevailed XXVII The loss sustained in this en gagement had no other effect on the van quished Vitellians than to reduce their turbulent spirit to a sense of military duty Ceecina threw the whole blame of his de feat upon the ungovernable temper of the 224 THE HISTORY book army at all times more disposed to mit tiny than to face the enemy The men now saw their error and began to submit to authority Nor was this the case with regard to Caecina only  the same reforma tion showed itself in the camp of Fabius Valens who was now advanced as far as Ticinum a The soldiers under his com mand were taught by the late event no longer to despise the enemy To retrieve the honour of the army they now were willing to behave with due submission to their general They had been not long before guilty of a bold and dangerous tu mult of which at the exact point of time no notice could be taken without break ing the thread of the narrative and de parting too much from the transactions under Caecina It ma now be proper to give an ac count of that insurrection The reader will remember that in the war between Nero and Vindex the cohorts of the Ba tavian nation separated from the four 1 teenth legion then on its way to Britain and having heard in the city of the Lin OF TACITUS 225 gones of commotions in favour of Vitel lius went over to the standard of Fabius Valens Their arrogance from that time knew no bounds They paraded the camp in every quarter and in the tents of the legions making it their boast  that by  them the fourteenth legion had been  overawed by them Italy was wrested  out of the hands of Nero and upon  their swords the issue of the war de  pended The Roman soldiers heard these speeches with indignation  disputes and quarrels filled the camp and disci pline was at an end Valens saw his au thority lessened and knew too well that from clamour to actual mutiny the transi tion is short and sudden XXVIII In this posture of affairs Va lens received advice that the Tungrians and Treverians had met with a defeat and that Otho s fleet was hovering on the coast of Narbon Gaul He took that opportunity to order a detachment of the Batavians to march to the relief of the province intending at the same time vol v Q 226 THE HISTORY book by a stroke of policy to divide the muti nous troops whom in their collective body he found impatient of control This measure gave umbrage to the rest of his army The auxiliaries murmured and the legions complained aloud  that they  were now to lose the bravest troops in  the service The enemy was near at  hand and was that a time to withdraw  a body of gallant soldiers who had so  often fought with undaunted courage  and so often returned crowned with vic  tory  If a single province is of more â â moment than the city of Rome and the  empire is but a secondary consideration Ai why not march with the united strength  of the whole army  On the other hand  if Italy must be the theatre of war if â there and there only a decisive victory  â can be obtained why separate from  the army those gallant veterans like the  soundest limbs cut off from the body â XXIX To allay this ferment Valens went forth preceded by his lictors The men paid no regard to their general they OF TACITUS 227 pelted him with stones they forced him book to fly before them they pursued with opprobrious language accusing him of having embezzled to his own private use the spoils of Gaul the gold of Vienne a and the recompense due to the soldiers for all their toil and labour They rushed to his pavilion pillaged his camp equipage and in hopes of finding hidden treasure pierced the ground with their spears and javelins Valens in the mean time dis guised like a slave lay concealed in the tent of an officer of the cavalry Alphe nus Varus the prajfect of the camp saw the phrensy subsiding and in the ebb of their passions thought it best to let re pentance take possession of them by de grees With that intent he gave orders to the centurions neither to visit the night watch nor suffer the usual signals to be given by sound of trumpet A dead si lence followed The mutineers stood co vered with astonishment wondering that no one assumed the command they gazed at each other and trembled at being left to themselves By silence and resig nation they hoped to give a proof of re q 2 228 THE HISTORY book turning virtue In the end they burst into tears and with humble supplications implored forgiveness Valens ventured to appear As soon as the soldiers saw him beyond expectation safe unhurt in a sordid dress with tears starting from his eye a mingled tumult of joy and sorrow and affection swelled in every breast With the quick transition of passions com mon with the multitude they poured forth their congratulations and with shouts of applause placed their general amidst the eagles and standards on his tribunal Valens acted with well timed moderation No man was singled out for punishment Afraid however that by too much cool ness he might make them suspect some deep design he thought fit to reprimand a few by name and his resentment went no further In the distractions of a civil war he knew that the power of the general is never equal to the liberty claimed by his soldiers b XXX While Valens employed his army in throwing up entrenchments at Ticinum an account of Caecina s defeat OF TACITUS 3229 reached the camp The flame of sedition book was ready to break out a second time All agreed that by the treachery of Valens they were detained from the field of bat tle They resolved to linger no longer they scorned to wait the motions of an in active commander they inarched before the colours and ordering the standard bearers to push on with alacrity never halted till by a rapid march they joined Carina s army In that camp Valens was in no kind of credit The vanquished soldiers complained that with an inferior force they were left exposed to the enemy and by extolling the strength and valour of their new friends they hoped to conci liate esteem and throw from themselves the imputation of cowardice Valens was at the head of an army which exceeded that of Caecina by almost double the number and yet the latter was the favour ite of the men His liberal spirit gained him friends and his generosity was praised by all To the vigour of youth he united a graceful figure and he possessed those nameless qualities a which though of no solid value conciliate favour men know 230 THE HISTORY book not why Hence a spirit of emulation between the two commanders Caecina objected to his rival the sordid vices that disgraced his character and in return Valens laughed at a man elate with pride and vain ostentation And yet the two chiefs acted towards each other with dis guised hostility In their zeal for the common cause their mutual animosities were suppressed though not extinguished In their letters they treated Otho and his licentious practices in a style that showed they scorned all terms of future reconci liation The conduct of the officers in the opposite army was very different They spoke of Vitellius with reserve and though his manners afforded ample mate rials for invective they chose to contain themselves within the bounds of pru dence XXXI It may be here observed that whatever were the shades of vice in the opposite characters of the contending chiefs death in the end made the true distinction between them  Otho fell with glory and Vitellius with disgrace and in of Tacitus 231 famy During their lives men dreadecl greater mischief from the unbridled pas sions of Otho than from the sluggish de bauchery of Vitellius The murder of Galba made the former an object of de testation  while the latter was never charged with being the author of the war a Vitellius by his gluttony and sensual appetites was his own enemy  Otho by his profusion his cruelty and his daring spirit was the enemy of his country As soon as the forces under Carina and Valens had formed a junction the Vitellian party wished for nothing so much as a decisive action Otho was not determined which was most for his inte rest a speedy engagement or a lingering war In this state of irresolution he called a council when Suetonius Pauhnus an officer surpassed by no man of that age judged it consistent with his high military character to weigh all circumstances and upon the whole to give a decided opinion He contended that to bring the dispute to an immediate issue was the business of Vitellius and on the contrary to draw the War into length was the game that 232 THE HISTORY BOOK U A U C 822 A D 69 Otho ought to play He argued as fol lows  XXXII  The whole collected force of Vitellius is now in Italy the re sources which he has left behind him are inconsiderable From Gaul he has no thing to expect The spirit of that fierce and turbulent people is still in agitation and while Germany with hostile numbers is ever ready to invade the Roman provinces the banks of the Rhine cannot be left naked and de fenceless The legions in Britain have the natives on their hands and they are divided by the sea Spain cannot boast of resources The province of Narbon Gaul has been harassed by Otho s fleet and is still covered with consternation The part of Italy which lies beyond the Po is shut in by the Alps deprived of all relief by sea and the armies that passed that way have made the whole country a scene of de isolation There is no place from which Vitellius can hope to be supplied with grain and he who wants provisions in OF TACITUS 233 A U C 8W A D  a short time will want an army The book  Germans a brave and warlike people v IJ  constitute the strength and bulwark of  the Vitellian party protract the war  and will they be able to go through a  summer campaign The change of  soil and the heat of the climate will  relax their vigour The war that by  strenuous efforts may be pushed to a  prosperous issue grows languid when  drawn into length and in a state of te  dious suspense whole armies have moul  dered away  On the other hand Otho s party is in  no want of supplies their friends arc  firm and great resources are still in re  serve Pannonia Maesia Dalmatia and  the eastern provinces are able to send  numerous armies into the field All â Italy declares for Otho  Rome the ca  pital of the empire is still in his posses  sion and above all he has on his side  the senate and the Roman people illus  trious names and always of the first im  portance though their glory in some con  junctures has been eclipsed There is still 234  THE HISTORY book  in reserve a store of wealth both public  and private and riches at all times are the sinews of war in public dissensions more  powerful than the sword The soldiers  in the service of Otho arc in good con  dition inured to Italy or seasoned to  the heat in warmer climates In their  front the river Po is a barrier and there tf are fortified cities strongly garrisoned  all determined to hold out to the last  Of this the gallant defence of Placentia  is a sufficient proof Tor these reasons  a slow and lingering Avar is the best ex  pedient Pass but a few days and the  fourteenth legion famous for its bravery w will arrive with a strong reinforcement  of auxiliaries from Maesia A council of  war may then be called  and should it  he thought advisable to hazard a battle  Otho in that event may take the field  with a superior army XXXIII Marius Celsus concurred in this opinion Annius Gallus was not present He had been hurt by a fall from bis horse a few days before and was not yet recovered but being consulted by OP TACITUS 235 persons sent for the purpose he acceded book to the counsels of Paulinus Otho was for trying the issue of a battle brother Titiapus and Proculus the pra fect of the praetorian guards though neither of them had any military ex perience did what in them lay to incite a temper of itself rash and precipitate The gods they said and the tutelar genius of Otho were present in council and would not fail to guide and animate the battle Such was the lanouase of rlatterv They made their poison palatable and no man presumed to administer an antidote To offer battle was the result of the debate but whether the emperor should command in person or withdraw to a place of safety was a question still to be discussed Celsus and Paulinus gave no opinion To expose the prince to the dangers of the field was more than they chose to hazard That point was left to ihe authors of the pernicious counsel al ready given By their advice Otho re tired to Brixellum there to reserve him self for the good of the people and the 236 THE HISTORY book majesty of empire From this day the ruin of Otho may be dated He took with him a considerable detachment of the prae r torian cohorts the body guard and a strong party of horse After their depar ture the spirit of the army began to droop They suspected their officers The prince to whom the soldiers were faithfully aU tached and who in return confided in them and them only abandoned his cause without leaving a head to direct or a general to whose authority the men were willing to submit XXXIV During these transactions nothing of all that passed was a secret in the camp of Vitellius From the deserters who in civil wars are always numerous and also from the spies whose genius it is while they pry into the secrets of others to betray their own every thing transpired Caecina and Valens lay in wait for the mo tions of an enemy whom they saw con triving their own destruction To plan an enterprise was unnecessary where the best wisdom was to succeed by the folly of others In order however to give jealousy 1 OF TACITUS 237 to the gladiators a on the opposite bank book of the Po and at the same time to keep their own soldiers employed they began to throw a bridge over the river As a foundation for the work they ranged in proper order a number of boats made fast at equal distances by strong timbers with their prows turned against the current and by their anchors secured from driving from the spot The cables were of a length to play in the water in order when the stream increased that the vessels might be gently lifted up and down without danger or confusion In the boat at the further extremity of the bridge they caused a tower to be erected which served at once to close the passage and give the men a station where they might with their battering engines prevent the ap proach of the enemy  XXXV The Othonians also raised a tower on the opposite bank and thence were able to annoy the enemy with massy stones and flaming brands A small island stood in the middle of the river The gladiators attempted to pass over in boats 238 THE HISTORf book but the Germans expert in swimming dashed into the stream and took posses sion of the place In order to dislodge them Macer put off with a strong party of gladiators on board his galleys but the gladiators were not able to cope with re gular soldiers  and the motion of the ves sels not allowing them a firm footing they fought at a disadvantage with men who from the land were able to discharge their missive weapons with surer aim and more certain effect On board the vessels all Avas hurry and confusion The rowers and combatants obstructed each other The Germans plunged into the river and seizing hold of the boats boarded several and sunk others to the bottom The whole passed under the eye of both armies The Vitellians looked on with joy while the adverse party stung with indignation railed at Macer whom they called the author of their disgrace XXXVI The gladiators in such ves sels as they could save retreated from the island and by their flight put an end to the engagement Macer was devoted to OF TACITUS 239 destruction The soldiers clamoured for book his blood One of them darted his lance and actually wounded him while the rest rushed on sword in hand and would have killed him on the spot if the tribunes and centurions had not interposed to save him from their fury In a short time after Vestricius Spurinna having by order of Otho left a moderate garrison at Placen tia can e up to the main body with the cohorts under his command Macer was superseded and in his place Flavius Sa binus consul elect was appointed to the great joy of the common men who saw with pleasure every change of their officers The commanders in their turn saw the unruly spirit of the army and with reluctance accepted a service so often disturbed by tumult and sedition XXXVII I find it asserted as a fact and by authors of credit that the two ar mies dreading the calamities of war and at the same time detesting the two rival princes whose flagitious deeds grew every day more notorious were disposed to lay down their arms and either to name a 240 THE HISTORY book person worthy of the succession or to re fer that matter to the choice of the senate This we are told was the consideration that weighed with Otho s generals when they proposed to draw the war into length and in particular that Paulinus acted with that motive He was the first and most distinguished of the consular rank the highest in military reputation and his conduct in Britain a had given jwiperior lustre to his name But though it may be reasonable to admit that a few in that juncture had the public good at heart and wished to see two vile competitors the most abandoned of mankind post poned to a virtuous prince it is notwith standing highly improbable that Paulinus a man of experience and consummate un derstanding should in an age so corrupt and profligate amuse himself with hopes of finding one spark of virtue He knew the madness of the times and could he expect that the same infatuated mui titude whose wickedness had kindled the flame of war would on a sudden prefer the blessings of peace and consent for the repose of the world to sheath the de of Tacitus 241 structive sword  Can it be imagined that to ok the armies then in the field dissonant in language and in their manners still more discordant could ever be brought to coalesce in one opinion  Above all can it be supposed that the leading chiefs a set of men immersed in luxury over whelmed with debts and conscious of their crimes would submit to any master who was not like themselves plunged in vice and by gratitude for his elevation obliged to be the patron of the most per nicious citizens  XXXVIII The love of power and do mination seems to be an instinct of the human heart a implanted by the hand of nature Coeval with the foundation of Home it grew with the growth of the em pire and in the hour of pride and gran deur broke out with resistless violence Before that period while the republic was in its infancy the equality of conditions was easily preserved In process of time when the pride of foreign kings was hum bled and rival nations submitted to the Roman arms avarice began to accumulate vol v n 242 THE HISTORY book riches and contentions arose between the senate and the people Factious tribunes prevailed at one time and ambitious con suls at another In the heart of the city and even in the forum the sword of dis cord was drawn and those dissensions were a prelude to the rage of civil war Caius Marius a man sprung from the dregs Of the populace and Lucius Sylla fierce and cruel beyond the rest of the nobility overturned the constitution of their country and on the ruins of public liberty established a system of tyranny and lawless power Pompey came soon after with passions more disguised but no way better From that time the struggle has been for supreme dominion The legions that filled the plains of Pharsalia and afterwards met at Philippi though com posed of lloman citizens never once thought of laying down their arms And are we to believe that the armies of Otho and Vitellius were of a more pacific tem per  They had instigations equally power ful  the same wrath of the gods pursued them  the same popular phrensy kindled the flame of discord and the same vices OP TACITUS 243 conspired to urge them on to mutual book slaughter Their war it is true was ended by a single battle but for that speedy issue the world was indebted not to the virtue  of the armies but to the abject spirit of the contending princes But these reflections on the spirit of antient and modern times have betrayed me into a long digression I resume the thread of my narrative XXXIX From the time when Otho withdrew to Brixellum his brother Ti tianus assumed all the pride and pomp of commander in chief but the power and real authority remained in the hands of Proculus Celsus and Paulinus were no more than mere nominal generals No man sought their advice They were in fact superseded serving no purpose but that of screening the folly of others and bear ing the blame of blunders not their own The tribunes and centurions could render no effectual service while ignorance and insufficiency were preferred and real ta lents lay neglected The common men appeared with an air of alacrity but more r 3 244 THE HISTORY book disposed to cavil with their generals than to execute their orders A sudden resolu tion was taken to shift their ground and encamp within four miles of Bedriacum a They conducted their march and chose their station with such want of skill that though it was then the spring of the year and the country round abounded with rivers the army was distressed for want of water The expediency of hazarding a battle became again the subject of debate Otho by frequent dispatches insisted on the most vigorous measures the soldiers called for their emperor and with clamour demanded his presence on the day of battle Many were of opinion that the forces beyond the Po should be called in to reinforce the army History has not materials to decide what would have been the most prudent measure but it is cer tain that of all possible evils they chose the worst XL They resolved to march to the conflux of the Po a and the Addua at the distance of sixteen miles In this move ment the soldiers presented no appearance OF TACITUS 245 of an army going to offer battle They book marched as if going to open a campaign not to decide it The measure was in di rect opposition to the advice of Celsus and Paulinus Those officers represented the danger of exposing the soldiers fatigued by their inarch and bending under the weight of their baggage to the attack of an enemy unincumbered and fresh from a march of four miles only An army in that condition would seize their opportu nity and begin a general assault before Otho s men could form the line of battle perhaps they were dispersed in small par ties or employed at the entrenchments Titianus and Proculus were not to be convinced When oveicome by argument they resorted to their orders and the will of the prince was a decisive answer About the same time a Numidian horseman 6 posting at full speed arrived with letters from Otho in a style of sharp reproof condemning the tedious operations of the army and in a peremptory tone com manding his generals to bring on a decisive action To a mind like his the interval of suspense was dreadful Delay kept him 246 THE HISTORY book in restless anxiety and hope and fear dis tracted him XLI On the same day while Caecina was employed in throwing a bridge over the Po two praetorian tribunes arrived to demand an interview They were admit ted to an audience when a sudden alarm from the scouts announced the enemy at hand The business broke off abruptly and the intention of the tribunes was left in the dark What their design was whe ther to betray their own party to lay a snare for the Vitellians or to make a fair and honourable proposal cannot now be known Caecina dismissed the tribunes and made the best of his way to the camp He found that Valens had lost no time the signal for battle was already given and the men were drawn out under arms While the legions were eagerly employed in settling by lot the order in which they were to take their stations in the field the ca valry advanced to charge the enemy and contrary to all expectation were put to the rout by an inferior number The Otho nians pursued with vigour and would have OF TACITUS 247 forced them to fly for shelter to their en trenchments had not the Italic legion opposed the runaways and sword in hand compelled them to return to the charge Meanwhile the rest of the army without hurry or confusion drew up in order of battle unmolested by the enemy and in fact without being seen as a thick cop pice that stood between both parties in tercepted their view In Otho s army nothing was seen but tu mult and distraction the chiefs without courage or authority the men mistrust ing their officers the ground not cleared of the baggage and the followers of the camp mixing in the ranks The road which they occupied was rendered so nar row by a ditch on each side that even though no enemy were at hand a march over the causey would have been per formed with difficulty Their whole army was in confusion some crowding about their colours  others at a loss and running to and fro to find their proper post all in a confused clamour roaring for their com rades answering to their names and con 248 THE HISTORY book founding one another with noise and up roar Some still shifting their ground advanced to the front line others fell into the rear none remaining in one spot but shifting their ground as fear or courage happened to prompt them XLII The Othonians had scarce re covered from their surprise when a sud den incident diffused a general joyj but a joy that tended to lull them into security and relax their courage into languor and stupid amazement A report was spread that the forces of Vitellius had abandoned his cause but from what quarter it took its origin whether by design or chance a from the emissaries of the Vitellians or the adverse party has never been ex plained The effect on the minds of the Othonians was altogether extraordinary Laying aside all thoughts of coming to action they saluted the opposite army who stood astonished and returned a deep and hollow murmur Those in Otho s ranks who did not know the cause of the civility shown by their friends thought themselves betrayed In that moment the Vitellians OP TACITUS 249 began the attack Their army was in re book gular order and their numbers were su perior The Othonians still in disorder and fatigued by their march received the first impression with undaunted firmness The place where the action grew warm being thick with trees and interwoven vine branches the combat varied accord ing to the nature of the ground They fought man to man they engaged at a distance they discharged their darts and missive weapons they brought forward separate battalions or advanced in the form of a wedge On the high road the en gagement was close and obstinate Darts and lances were of no use They fought hand to hand foot to foot and buckler against buckler With their swords and axes they cut through helmets and breast plates They knew one another each in dividual was conspicuous to his friends and enemies his exploits were seen by all and every man fought as if the issue of the war depended upon his single arm XLIII Upon an open plain of con siderable extent that lay between the Po 2 250 THE HISTORY book and the high road two legions met in fierce encounter on the part of Vitellius the one and twentieth famed for its va lour and commonly known by the name of Rapax a on the side of Otho the first legion entitled Adjutrix which had never been in action and now panted for an opportunity to flesh their maiden swords Their first attack was not to be resisted They broke through the ranks of the one and twentieth and carried off their eagle Roused by this disgrace the Vitellians added rage to bravery and bore down all before them Orphidius Benig nus who commanded Otho s legion fell in the conflict His men were driven back with great slaughter and the loss of se veral standards In another part of the field the thirteenth legion was routed by the fifth and the fourteenth was hemmed in by superior numbers Otho s generals had long since fled the field while Caecina and Valens continued to exert themselves watching every turn of the battle and sup porting the ranks in every quarter Fresh forces came to their assistance The Ba tavians under Varus Alphenus having OF TACITUS 251 cut to pieces the gladiators attempting in book boats to cross the Po came into the field â vâ flushed with success and charged the 82s enemy in flank  XLIV The centre of Otho s army gave way and fled with precipitation towards Bedriacum A long space lay before them the road was obstructed with heaps of slain and the enemy hung upon their rear In civil wars no prisoners are re served for sale the slaughter for that rea son was the more dreadful Â Sueto nius Paulinus and Lieinius Proculus fled different ways both resolved not to return to the camp Vedius Aquila who com manded the thirteenth legion by his own indiscretion exposed himself to the fury of the soldiers  He entered the camp while it was yet broad day light and the very men who were the first to turn their backs on the enemy were now the foremost in sedition They crowded round their su perior officer with a torrent of abusive lan guage and offered violence to his person They charged him with treachery and de sertion in the true spirit of vulgar minds 252 THE HISTORY book transferring to others their own guilt and infamy Titianus and Celsus owed their safety to the darkness of the night They did not venture into the camp till the sentinels were stationed at their posts and the tumult was appeased by the entrea ties the advice and authority of Annius Gallus who had the address to make the men sensible of the folly and madness of adding to the havoc of the field by their own destructive fury Whether the war was at an end or to be once more renewed with vigour he represented in either case the necessity of union among themselves A face of sorow and dejection covered the camp All were hushed in silence all but the praetorians who still grumbled discontent asserting that they were de feated by treachery not by the valour of the enemy  The Vitellians they said  could not boast of a cheap victory  Their cavalry was routed and one of  their legions lost their eagle Otho still  survived and the troops beyond the Po  were ready to advance the legions from  Maesia were on their march and a con  siderable part of the army detained at OF TACITUS 253  Bedriacum had no share in the action book  These were still in reserve they were  not conquered  and if a total overthrow  was to be their lot they might fall with  glory in the field of battle With these and suchlike reflections the praetorians kept their minds in agitation by turns in flamed with anger or depressed with fear They saw their ruined condition  despair succeeded and from despair they derived courage and a spirit of revenge XLV The victorious army halted at the distance of five miles from Bedriacum The generals did not think it advisable on the same day to attempt the enemy s camp Expecting a voluntary surrender they were willing to give their men some time to repose To encamp was not in their power The soldiers took the field pre pared for battle unincumbered and of course without the means of throwing up entrenchments Their arms and their vic tory were their only fortification On the following day the Othonians showed a pa cific disposition and even those who the sight before breathed nothing but war and 254 THE HISTORY book vengeance with one consent agreed tÂ send a deputation to the enemy The Vi tellian leaders were willing to hearken to terms of accommodation The deputies not returning immediately the suspense occasioned an awful interval in Otho s camp Peace was at length announced and the entrenchments were thrown open A tender scene ensued The conquerors and the conquered embraced each other and with mingled joy and sorrow lamented the horrors of civil war In the same tents relations friends and brothers dressed each others wounds They now perceived that their hopes were a mere delusion and that slaughter sorrow and repentance were their certain lot Nor was there in the two armies a single person who had not the death of a friend or a relation to lament The body of Orphidius the commander of a legion after diligent search was found among the slain and burnt with the usual solemnities A few of the common men were buried by their friends the rest were left to welter on the bare earth XLYI Otho in the mean time having OF TACITUS 255 taken his resolution waited without fear book II or dejection of mind for an account of the event Vague and uncertain rumours reached his ear At length the fugitives who escaped from the field brought sure intelligence that all was lost The soldiers who stood near his person did not stay to hear the sentiments of the emperor but broke out with impatient ardour exhort ing him to summon up his best resolution There were forces still in reserve and in their prince s cause they were ready to brave every danger In this declaration there was no flattery they spoke from the heart In a fit of instinctive fury they de sired to be led against the enemy by their example the drooping spirit of their friends would be once more excited to deeds of valour The men who stood at a distance stretched forth their hands in token of their assent while such as gathered round the prince fell at his feet and clasped his knees Plotius Firmus distinguished him self by his zeal This officer commanded the praetorian guards He implored his master not to abandon an army devoted to his interest nor to renounce a brave and 7 256 THE HISTORY book generous soldiery who had undergone so much and were still ready to face every danger  The noble mind a he said  stands a siege against adversity while  the little spirit capitulates at once True  courage grapples with misfortune and  in the last distress still makes head  against every difficulty The mean  and abject sink down in despair and â yield without a struggle The soldiers fixed their eyes on the prince and with every symptom in his countenance their passions varied If he assented they thundered forth their applause if he seemed inflexible a groan expressed the anguish of their hearts Nor was the spirit confined to the praetorians who were pro perly the soldiers of Otho it extended to the detachment sent forward by the Mscsian legions Those men with one voice declared for Otho they assured him that the same zeal pervaded their comrades who were coming forward by rapid marches and even then had entered Aquileia Hence it is evident that great resources still remained and that a fierce and ob stinate war uncertain in the event and 0F fAOJTUS 257 big with danger to all parties might have book been renewed and carried on with vigour XLVII Otho had weighed all circum stances  ambition was at an end and he prepared to close the scene a He adj dressed the soldiers to the following effect  When I behold the ardour that glows in  every breast when I consider the virtue  that inspires so many gallant friends  I  cannot think of exposing you again to  the destructive sword nor do I value  my life at such a pricei The views  which you display to me were I dis  posed to live are bright and tempting  by renouncing them I fall with greater  glory I have made acquaintance with  fortune we have tried each other for  what length of time is not material but  the felicity which does not promise to  last cannot be enjoyed with modera  tion Vitellius began the war he  claimed the empire and by conse  quence I was obliged to have recourse â to arms That we fought once his am  bition was the cause to end the dis  pute by the event of one battle and stop vol v s 258 THE HISTORY the effusion of Roman blood shall

sovereign power longer than I have  done  with equal calmness no man has  resigned it Can I give to the edge of  the sword so many gallant soldiers  Can  I see the armies of Rome devoted to  mutual slaughter and for ever cut off  from their country  It is enough for me  that in my cause you are ready to shed  your blood Let that generous zeal  attend me to my grave I thank you  for it but you must still survive to serve  the commonwealth For this great end  let us agree to remove all obstacles I  will be no bar to your preservation nor  will you attempt to frustrate my reso  lution When

friends addressing each of them in gracious terms according to his rank his age or dignity and advising all to depart without loss of time and make their terms with the con queror He entreated the old men and with the young exerted his authority Calm and undisturbed serenity in his countenance and firmness in his voice he saw his friends weep and endeavoured to repress their tears He ordered boats or carriages for those who were willing to depart He selected all such papers and letters as happened to contain expressions of duty towards himself or ill will to Vi tellius and committed them to the flames He distributed money in presents but not with the profusion of a man quitting the world Observing that his brother s son Salvius Cocceianus a youth in the flower of his age was dissolved in tears he en deavoured to assuage his sorrows He s 2 260 TH HISTORY book commended the goodness of his heart but his fears he said were out of season  Could it be supposed that Vitellius find  ing his own family safe would refuse  with brutal inhumanity to return the  generosity shown to himself My death  will leave him without a rival and that  very act will be a demand upon his cle  mency especially since it is not an act  of despair but a voluntary resignation  made at a time when a brave and gene  rous army calls aloud for another battle  For the good of the commonwealth I am  a willing victim For myself I have  gained ample renown and I leave to my  family an illustrious name After the  Julian race a the Claudian and the  Servian I am the first who transferred  the sovereignty to a new family It be  comes you young man to act with  courage you must dare to live Re  member that Otho was your uncle but  remember it with modesty and without  resentment â â  â  XLIX Afte r this he desired his friends to withdraw Being left alone he OP TACITUS 261 composed himself to rest and in a short book time began to prepare for the last act of his life In that moment he was inter rupted by a sudden uproar The soldiers he was told threatened destruction to all who offered to depart and in particular to Verginius a whom they kept besieged in his house Otho went forth to appease the tumult Having reproved the authors of the disturbance he returned to his apartment and received the visits of all that came to bid the last farewell he con versed with them freely and cheerfully and saw them depart without let or moles tation Towards the close of day he called for a draught of cold water and having quenched his thirst ordered two poniards to be brought to him He tried the points of both and laid one under his pillow Being informed that his friends were safe On their way he passed the night in quiet We are assured that he even slept At the dawn of day he applied the weapon to his breast and fell upon the point His dying groans alarmed his freedmen and slaves They rushed into the chamber and with them Plotius Firmus the praetorian 262 THE HISTORY book praefect They found that with one wound he had dispatched himself His body was burnt without delay This had been his earnest request lest his head b should fall into the hands of his enemies and be made a public spectacle He was borne on the shoulders of the praetorian soldiers to the funeral pile The men during the procession paid all marks of respect to his remains They printed kisses on his hands and on the mortal wound and in a flood of tears poured forth their warmest praise At the funeral pile some of the soldiers put an end to their lives not from any consciousness of guilt nor yet im pelled by fear but to emulate the ex ample of their prince and to show them selves faithful to the last At Bedriacum Placentia and other camps numbers fol lowed the example A sepulchre c was raised to the memory of Otho but of an ordinary structure protected by its mean ness and therefore likely to last L Siich was the end of Otho in the thirty seventh year of his age He was born in the municipal city of Ferentum OF TACITUS 203 His father was of consular rank his grand father had discharged the office of prstor By the maternal line his descent was re spectable though not illustrious The features of his character as well in his earliest days a as in the progress of his youth have been already delineated By two actions of his life he stands distin guished  one atrocious and detestable the other great and magnanimous  the former has consigned his name to eternal infamy and the last will do honour to his memory History cannot descend to the frivolous task of collecting vague reports in order to amuse the reader with a fabu lous detail but there are traditions which have been handed down with an air of authenticity and these I shall not take upon me to suppress or to refute On the day when the battle was fought at Bedria cum a bird of unusual appearance was observed to perch in a grove near Regium Lepidum b and notwithstanding the great concourse of people and a numerous flight of other birds never to move from its place till Otho put an end to his life That event no sooner happened than it 264 THE HISTORY waved its wings and vanished out of sight The people of the village aver the fact and according to curious observers who made an exact computation of the time this extraordinary phenomenon tallied exactly with the beginning of the battle and the prince s death c LI The grief of the soldiers at the fu neral ceremony drove them in a fit of distraction to another mutiny No offi cer assumed the command no one inter fered to allay the ferment The men de manded a sight of Verginius one moment calling upon him to accept the sovereignty and the next with mingled prayers and menaces pressing him to undertake an embassy on their behalf to Valens and Caecina Verginius seeing them deter mined to enter his house by force made his escape at the back door The cohorts that lay encamped at Brixellum deputed Rubrius Gallus with terms of submission That officer obtained their pardon At the same time Flavius Sabinus made terms for himself and with the troops under his command submitted to the conqueror i TOF TACITUS 265 LII Though the war was now at an book end a great part of the senate who ac companied Otho from Home and by him were left at Mutina found themselves in volved in the utmost danger They re reived an account of the defeat at Bcdria cum but the soldiers treated it as a false alarm Suspecting the integrity of the fathers and fully persuaded that they were in secret enemies to Otho and his cause they watched their motions listened to their words and with their usual ma lignity gave to every thing that passed the worst construction They proceeded to reproach and every kind of insult hoping to find a pretence for an insurrec tion and a general massacre The senators saw another cloud gathering over their heads  they knew that the Vitellian party triumphed and if they were tardy with their congratulations the delay might be thought a spirit of disaffection In this dilemma they called a meeting of the whole order No man dared to act alone In the conduct of all each individual hoped to find his own personal safety At the same time an ill judged compliment from 2 266  THE HISTORY book the people of Mutina increased the appre hensions of the senators The magistrates of the city made a tender of arms and money for the public service and in the style of their address gave to a small party of senators the appellation of con script fathers a title always applied to the collective body LIII In the debate that followed in a thin meeting of the fathers a violent dis pute broke out between Licinius Caecina and Eprius Marcellus the former with warmth and vehemence charging it as a crime against Marcellus that he spoke in ambiguous terms and with studied ob scurity The case was by no means sin gular all were equally dark and myste rious  but the name of Marcellus who had conducted so many prosecutions a was universally detested and Caecina a new man lately admitted into the senate thought to rise by encountering powerful enmities The dispute was ended by the interposition of wiser men The senate adjourned to Bononia intending there to meet again when they hoped to have 7 OP TACITUS 267 more certain intelligence They stationed book messengers on all the public roads to in terrogate every man that passed One of Otho s freedmen came in their way Be ing asked why he had left his master he made answer  I have with me the dir  rections and last will of the prince who  is still alive but he renounces all the  joys of life his thoughts are fixed upon  posterity and he has now no other  care This account made an impres sion on every mind  all stood astonished and soon after without asking any further questions went over to Vitellius LIV Lucius Vitellius brother of the new emperor attended the meeting of the senate The fathers began to address him in a flattering strain and he was will ing to receive their incense His joy was soon interrupted One Caenus a freed man of Nero s by a bold and impudent falsehood threw the assembly into conster nation He affirmed it as a fact that the fourteenth legion with the forces from Brixellum attacked the victorious party and gained a complete victory The ino 268 THE HISTORY tive of this man for framing a story so false and groundless was because he saw Otho s orders for road horses a and car riages no longer in force and he wished to revive their former authority By this stratagem he gained a quick conveyance to Rome and in a few days was put to death by order of Vitellius In the mean time the Othonian soldiers gave credit to the fiction and even believed that the fa thers who had departed from Mutina to deliberate at Bononia were gone over to the enemy From this time the senate was convened no more Every man acted with his own private views till let ters arrived from Fabius Valens and put an end to all their fears Besides this the death of Otho was universally known The velocity of fame was equal to the glory of that heroic action LV Meanwhile at Rome a general calm prevailed The games sacred to Ceres o were celebrated according to annual custom In the midst of the public spectacle intelligence arrived that Otho was no more and that all the mili OF TACITUS 269 tary then in the city had at the requisi tion of Flavius Sabinus sworn fidelity to Vitellius  the people heard the news with transport and the theatre shook with applause The audience crowned with laurel wreaths and strewing the way with flowers went forth in procession and with the images of Galba displayed in a trium phant manner visited the several temples and afterwards with their chaplets raised a fancied tomb to his memory on the spot near the lake of Curtius where that emperor breathed his last The various honours which flattery at different times had lavished on former princes were de creed by the senate to the new sovereign They passed a vote of thanks to the Ger man armies and dispatched special mes sengers to congratulate Vitellius on his accession to the imperial dignity A let ter from Fabius Valens to the consuls was read in the senate and though there was nothing of arrogance in the style the re spectful modesty of Caecina who remain ed s ent gave greater satisfaction LVJ Peace was now established 270 THE HISTORY book throughout Italy but it was a peace more destructive than the calamities of war The Aritellian soldiers quartered in the colonies and municipal cities were still bent on spoil and rapine They com mitted the most horrible outrages de flouring the women and trampling on all laws human and divine Where they re frained from injury they received a bribe for their forbearance Nothing sacred or profane was spared Innocent men were marked out as soldiers of Otho s party and under that pretence murdered by their private enemies The soldiers who best knew the country fixed upon the opulent farmers as their devoted prey Where the lands were rich they laid waste and plundered without control All who resisted were put to the sword The ge neral officers had no power to check the mischief What they had done them selves they could not oppose in others Caecina had not the avarice of his col league  popularity was his passion Va lens on the contrary had made himself infamous by his rapacity and was there fore obliged to connive when he saw his OF TACITUS 271 own vices practised by others Italy was book long since exhausted and in that impo â vâ verished state obliged to maintain nume Â â A D rous armies and to bear the superadded  grievances of riot insult and devastation LVII Vitellius in the mean time advanced towards Italy with the remain der of the German armies ignorant of his victory and still conceiving that he was to meet the whole weight of the war A few of the veteran soldiers were left be hind in winter quarters and to recruit the legions which retained little more than their name hasty levies were made in Gaul On the frontiers bordering on the Rhine the command was given to Hordeo  nius Flaccus To his own army Vitellius added eidit thousand men from Britain Having marched a few days he received intelligence of the victory at Bedriacum and the conclusion of the war by the death of Otho He called an assembly of the soldiers and in a public harangue extolled the valour of the troops that con quered in his service He had with him a freedman of the name of Asiaticus a 272 THE HISTORY book The army wished to see him raised to the dignity of a Roman knight Vitellius knew that the request was a flight of adu lation and had the spirit to reject it but such was his natural levity that what he refused in public he granted in private over his bottle And thus a despicable slave who was goaded on by ambition and had nothing to recommend him but his vices was honoured with the eques trian ring LVIII About the same time Vitellius received advices that the two Mauri tanias a had acceded to his party This event was occasioned by the murder of Luceius Albinus the governor of that country The province which was called Caesariensis had been by Nero committed to Albinus and the other called Tingi tana was afterwards added by Galba In consequence of his extensive com mand the governor was master of a con siderable force not less than nineteen cohorts five squadrons of horse and a numerous body of Moors accustomed to live by depredation and by their hardy OF TACITUS 273 course of life prepared for the fatigues of book war Albinus on the death of Galba de clared in favour of Otho and not content with his power in Africa began to form an enterprise against Spain which was separated by a narrow channel b Clu vius Rufus presided in Spain Alarmed at the projects of the commander in Africa he ordered the tenth legion to march to the sea coast with a design as he gave out to cross the sea In the mean time he dispatched a few chosen centu rions to tamper with the Moors and draw them over to the interest of Vitellius This was not a difficult task The fame of the German armies resounded through all the provinces A report prevailed at the same time that Albinus disdaining the title of procurator had usurped the regal dia dem and the name of Juba LIX The currents of popular opi nion were by these circumstances entirely changed in Africa Asinius Pollio who commanded a squadron of horse in that country and professed himself devoted to Albinus was immediately murdered vol v T 274 THE HISTORY book Festus and Scipio each the praefect of a cohort shared the same fate Albinu himself after a short voyage from the pro vince of T ingitana to that of Caesariensis was put to death as soon as he landed His wife attempting to oppose the assas sins perished with her husband These transactions passed without the notice of Vitellius Nothing awakened his curio sity Even in matters of the highest im portance the attention of a moment was all that could be expected from a man who had neither talents nor application to business He ordered his army to pursue their march into Italy while he himself sailed down the Arar a not with the pomp and grandeur of a prince but still exposing to public view the distress and poverty l of his former condition At length Junius Blaesus at that time go vernor of the Lyonese Gaul a man of a large and liberal mind by his birth il lustrious and of a spirit equal to his vast possessions supplied Vitellius with a train suited to the imperial dignity and at tended in person to do honour to the new emperor Vitellius saw this display 4 OF TACITUS 275 of magnificence with an evil eye but book under specious and even servile caresses took care to hide his jealousy At Lyons the general officers of both parties as well the vanquished as the victorious attended to do homage to the prince Vitellius in a public speech pronounced the panegy ric of Valens and Caecina whom he placed on each side of his curule chair He then ordered out the whole army to receive his son then an infant of tender years The soldiers obeyed The father took the child in his arms and having adorned him with a purple robe and other marks of princely grandeur saluted him by the title of Ger manicus in this manner bestowing ex travagant honours even in the tide of pro sperity ill judged and out of season but perhaps in the reverse of fortune that happened afterwards some Source of con solation LX The centurions who had sig nalized themselves in Otho s service were by order of Vitellius put to death By this act of cruelty he lost the affections of the forces from Illyricum The rest of t 2 276 THE HISTORY book the legions caught the infection and being already on bad terms with the Ger man soldiery began to meditate a revolt Suetonius Paidinus and Licinius Proculus were kept for some time in a wretched state of suspense Being at length ad mitted to an audience they made a de fence which nothing but the necessity of the times could excuse They charged themselves with treachery to Otho and to their own sinister designs ascribed the march of the army on the day of battle the fatigue of the troops and the confu sion in the ranks occasioned by not re moving the baggage with many other in cidents from which though accidental they derived to themselves the merit of fraud and perfidy Vitellius gave them credit for their guilt and pardoned though they had been in arms against himself their attachment to his enemy Salvius Titianus was exempt from danger Natural affection made him join his bro theri and his despicable character shel tered him from resentment Marius Cel sus consul elect was suffered to succeed to hia honours though Cireilius Simplex 2 OF TACITUS 277 as was generally believed endeavoured by book bribery to supplant him His ambition aimed at the consulship and would fain have risen on the ruins of an Othonian officer The attempt was afterwards ob jected to him in open senate The empe ror however withstood his solicitations but in time raised hjm a to that high of fice without the guilt of bribery or murder Trachalus was attacked by his enemies but owed his safety to the protection of Galeria the wife of Vitellius I XI Amidst the dangers that invol ved the first men of the age it may be thought beneath the dignity of history to relate the wild adventure of one Mariccus a Boian by birth and sprung from the dregs of the people This man however mean his condition had the presumption to mix his name with men who fought for the empire of the world In a fit of en thusiasm pretending to have preterna tural lights he called himself the tutelar Deity of Gaul and in the character of a god dared to defy the Roman arms He played the impostor so well that he was 278 THE HISTORY able to muster eight thousand men At the head of that deluded multitude he made an attempt on the adjacent villages of the iEduans The people of that na tion were not to be deluded They armed the flower of their youth and with a rein forcement from the Roman cohorts at tacked the fanatics and put the whole body to the rout Mariccus was taken prisoner and soon after given to the wild beasts a The populace astonished to see that he was not immediately torn to pieces believed him to be sacred and in violable Vitellius ordered him to be ex ecuted under his own eye and that ca tastrophe cured the people of their bi gotry  LXII From this time the partisans of Otho were no longer persecuted Their persons and their effects remained invio lable The last wills of such as fell in that unfortunate cause were allowed to be valid and where no will was made the law in cases of intestacy took its course In fact it was the luxury of Vitellius that oppressed mankind from his avarice there OF TACITUS 379 â was nothing to fear His gluttony a knew no bounds To administer to his appetite Rome and Italy were ransacked for rarities The roads from both the seas rung with a din of carriages loaded with whatever was exquisite to the palate To entertain him on his march the principal men of every city were obliged to lavish all their wealth and the country was ex hausted The soldiers degenerating into a band of epicures lost all regard for mi litary duty They despised their prince yet followed his example Vitellius by an edict sent forward to Rome signified his pleasure to postpone for the present the title of Augustus and for that of Caesar he declined it altogether The prerogative of the prince was sufficient for his ambition He ordered the mathe maticians to be banished out of Italy and under heavy penalties restrained the Roman knights from disgracing themselves by fighting prizes like common gladiators and by exhibiting their persons on the public stage That infamous practice was introduced by former princes who did not scruple to allure men to the theatre by 280 THE HISTORY book donations of money and when bribery failed to drive them to it by force and violence The contagion reached the municipal towns and colonies where it became the general practice to lie in wait for the young and profligate in order by the temptation of money to invite them to disgrace and infamy LXIII The character of Vitellius soon after the arrival of his brother a and other courtiers from Rome came forth in the blackest colours That pernicious crew began to teach their maxims of de spotism and the prince displayed his cruel ty and his arrogance He gave orders for the execution of Dolabella who as al ready stated on the first breaking out of the war was banished by Otho to the co lony of Aquine Being there informed of that emperor s death he ventured to re turn to Rome That step was objected to him as a crime by his intimate friend Plancius Varus a man of praetorian rank He preferred his accusation in form be fore Flavius Sabinus the praefect of the city The specific charges were that Do OF TACITUS 281 labella broke from his place of confine book ment to offer himself as a leader to the vanquished party and with that view had endeavoured to seduce to his interest the cohort stationed at Ostia In the course of the trial Dolabella heard the whole of the evidence with undaunted firmness never showing the smallest sym ptom of anxiety  but sentence of con demnation was pronounced and he then found it too late to sue for mercy The business however seemed to Flavius Sa binus of such importance that he began to hesitate till Triaria the wife of Lucius Vitellius a woman fierce and cruel beyond her sex advised him not to seek the fame of clemency by sacrificing the interest of the prince Sabinus did not want humanity but when danger threatened himself his resolution failed With a sudden change of mind he began to temporise and in order to secure his own personal safety lent his aid to precipitate the fall of a man whom he did not dare to protect LXIV By this business Vitellius was alarmed for himself and he had motives 282 THE HISTORY of inveterate hatred Petronia his former wifc Â was no sooner divorced than Do labella married her Hence that unhappy man was an object of the emperor s fixed resentment By letters dispatched to Rome he invited him to his presence ad vising him at the same time to shun the Flaminian road and come more private ly by the way of Interamnium At that place he ordered him to be put to death The assassin thought he should lose too much time Impatient to do his work he attacked Dolabella at an inn on the road and having stretched him on the ground cut his throat Such was the beoinninar of the new reign a prelude to scenes of blood that were still to follow The fu rious spirit of Triaria who took so active a part in this affair was the more detested as it stood in contrast to the mild character of Galeria the emperor s wife and also to that of Sextilia b his mother a woman of virtue and benevolence formed on the model of antient manners On receipt of the first letters from the emperor wherein he assumed the title of Germanicus she is said to have declared that she had no OF TACITUS 283 son of that name but was the mother book h of Vitellius c She persevered with the same equal temper never elated by the 822 splendour of her family nor deceived by 69 the voice of flattery In the prosperity of her sons she took no part in their di stress she grieved for their misfortunes LXV Vitellius set out from Lyons but had not proceeded far when he was met by Marcus Cluvius Rufus who came from his government in Spain to congra tulate the emperor on his accession That officer appeared with joy in his counte nance and anxiety in his heart He knew that an accusation had been pre pared against him by Hilarius one of the emperor s freedmen importing that du ring the war between Otho and Vitellius Rufus intended to set up for himself and convert both the Spains into an indepen dent state and that with this view he had issued various edicts without insert ing the name of any prince whatever and also made public harangues to blacken the character of Vitellius and recommend himself to popular favour The interest 284 THE HISTORY  book of Rufus was too powerful He triumphed over his adversary and the freedraan was condemned to punishment Rufus from that time ranked among the emperor s intimate friends He continued in favour at court and at the same time retained his government of Spain  during his ab sence carrying on the administration of the province by his deputies according to the precedent left by Lucius Ammtius a whom Tiberius from suspicion and the jea lousy of his nature never suffered to de part from Rome Trebellius Maximus 6 had not the good fortune to meet with equal favour He had been the governor of Britain but by a mutiny among the soldiers was obliged to escape out of the island Vectius Bolanus c then a fol lower of the court succeeded to the com mand LXVI Vitellius heard with deep anxiety that the vanquished legions still retained a fierce and unconquered spirit Dispersed through Italy and in every quarter intermixed with the victorious troops they talked in a style of disaffeo op taCiTi s 285 tion breathing vengeance and new com motions The fourteenth legion took the lead denying with ferocity that they were ever conquered It was true they said that at Bedriacum a vexillary detachment from their body was defeated but the le gion had no share in the action To re move such turbulent spirits it was judged proper to order them back into Britain where they had been stationed till re called by Nero The Batavian cohorts were ordered to march at the same time and as an old animosity subsisted between them and the soldiers of the fourteenth le gion orders were given that they should all be quietly quartered together Between men inflamed with mutual hatred a quar rel soon broke out It happened at the capital of the Turinians Â that a Bata vian soldier had words with a tradesman whom he charged with fraud and im position A man belonging to the le gion took the part of his landlord A dispute ensued their comrades joined them from abusive language they pro ceeded to blows and if two praetorian cohorts had not overawed the Batavians a bloody conflict must have been the con 286 The history book sequence Vitellius satisfied with the fidelity of the Batavians incorporated them with his army The legion had or ders to proceed over the Graian Alps  and by no means to approach the city of Vienne where the inhabitants were sus pected of disaffection The legion march ed in the night and left their fires burning The consequence was a conflagration by which a great part of the Turinian city was destroyed The loss sustained by the inhabitants like many other calamities of Avar was soon obliterated by the ruin of other cities The soldiers had scarce de scended from the Alps when they ordered the standard bearers to march towards the colony of Vienne The attempt however was prevented by the good sense of such as were observers of discipline and the whole legion passed over into Britain LXVII The praetorian cohorts gave no less disquietude to Vitellius To break their force he separated them first into small parties and soon after discharged them from the service professing how ever in order to soften resentment that they were by their length of service en OP TACITUS 287 titled to an honourable dismission They delivered up their arms to the tribunes but being informed that Vespasian was in motion they assembled again and proved the best support of the Flavian cause The first legion of marines was ordered into Spain that in repose and in dolence their spirit might evaporate The seventh and eleventh returned to their old winter quarters For the thirteenth em ployment was found in the building of two amphitheatres one at Cremona and the other at Bononia In the former Caecina was preparing to exhibit a spectacle of gladiators and Valens in the latter both wishing to gratify the taste of their master whom in the midst of arduous affairs no thing could wean from his habitual plea sures LXVIII Br these measures the van quished party was sufficiently weakened  but the spirit of the conquerors could not long endure a state of tranquillity A quarrel broke out in its origin slight and ridiculous but attended with conse quences that kindled the flame of war 28S THE HISTORY book with redoubled fury a The occasion was as follows Vitellius gave a banquet at Ticinum and Verginius was of the party The manners of the chiefs are ever sure to set the fashion for the tribunes and cen turions From the example of the officers vice or virtue descends to the soldiers In the army of Vitellius all was disorder and confusion  a scene of drunken jollity re sembling a bacchanalian rout rather than a camp or a disciplined army It hap pened that two soldiers one belonging to the fifth legion the other a native of Gaul serving among the auxiliaries of that nation challenged each other to a trial of skill in wrestling The Roman was thrown his antagonist exulted with an air of triumph and the spectators who had gathered round them were soon divided into parties The legions provoked by the insolence of the Gaul attacked the auxiliaries sw6rd in hand Two cohorts were cut to pieces The sudden danger of another tumult put an end to the fray A cloud of dust was seen at a distance and at intervals the OF fAGITUS 289 glittering of arms A report was instantly book spread that the fourteenth legion was re turning to offer battle but the mistake was soon discovered It was found that the men who brought up the rear of the army were approaching That circumstance being known the tumult subsided till one of the slaves of Verginius was observed by the soldiers They seized the man and in their fury charged him with a design to assassinate Vitellius With this notion in their heads they rushed directly to the banqueting room and with rage and cla mour demanded the immediate execution of Verginius The emperor though by nature addicted to suspicion entertained no doubt of Verginius He interposed to save his life and with difficulty restrained the men who thirsted for the blood of a consular commander at one time their own general It had ever been the fate of Verginius more than of any other offi cer to encounter the seditious spirit of the army His character notwithstand ing was held in great esteem his bril liant talents extorted admiration even from his enemies but the moderation vol v u â 290 THE HISTORY book with which he rejected the imperial dig vâ â Â nity was considered as an affront The 822 soldiers thought themselves despised and Â from that moment resented the injury LXIX On the following day the de puties from the senate who according to order attended at Ticinum were admitted to an audience That business over Vitel lius visited the camp and in a public harangue expressed a lively sense of the zeal which the soldiers had exerted in his service This proceeding roused the jea lousy of the auxiliaries They saw the insolence of the legionary soldiers and the impunity with which they commit ted the most outrageous

war The allies from Gaul were also dismissed to their re spective states a vast unwieldy multi tude drawn together in the beginning of the revolt not for actual service but chiefly UK vain parade and to swell the pomp of OF TACITUS 291 a numerous army The imperial revenues book being well nigh exhausted there was rea son to apprehend a want of funds to an swer the largesses of the prince To pre vent that distress Vitellius ordered the complement of the legions and auxiliaries to be reduced and no new levies to be made Dismissions from the service were granted indiscriminately to all who ap plied The policy was of the worst con sequence to the commonwealth and at the same time a grievance to the soldiers who felt themselves oppressed by returns of military duty too frequent for the scanty numbers that remained Their fa tigue increased while their manners were debauched and their vigour wasted by the vices of a luxurious life so different from the institutions of the old republic when money was despised and virtue was the energy of the state LXX Vitellius proceeded to Cre mona Having there attended a spectacle of gladiators exhibited by Caecina he was led by curiosity to the field of Bedriacum in order to see on the spot the vestiges of u2 292 THE HISTORY book his recent victory The fields around â Â presented a mournful spectacle Forty 822 days a had elapsed and the

the earth trampled under toot the whole a dreary waste the desolation of nature The view  of the high road was no less shocking to humanity The people of Cremona amidst the horrors that covered the face of the country had strewed the way with roses and laurels and had even raised altars where victims were slain as if a nation of slaves1 had been employed to adorn the triuntph of a despotic prince But these servile acts with which an abject people rejoiced over human misery in a short time afterv brought on their own destruc tion Valens and Caecina attended the emperor to the field They

more outrageous Players of in A U C 822  terludes and a band of eunuchs mixed with A IX 69 the soldiers and revived all the vices of Nero s court Vitellius admired the man ners of that shameful period and where ever Nero went to display his voice and minstrelsy he was sure to be one of his followers not by compulsion as was the case with men of integrity but of his own motion a willing sycophant allured by his palate and bribed by gluttony In order to open the way for Valens and Cas cina to the honours of the consulship the time of those in office a was abridged Martius Macer b who had been a general in Otho s party was passed over in silence and Valerius Marinus who had been put in nomination by Galba was also set aside not for any charge alleged against him but because being a man of a passive temper he was willing to acquiesce under every injury without a murmur Pedanius Costa shared the same fate He had taken an active part against Nero and even en deavoured to excite the ambition of Ver ginius He was in fact rejected for that OF TACITUS 295 offence though other reasons were pre book tended For this proceeding Vitellius re v v ceived public thanks to acts of oppres 822  sion the servility of the times gave the 69 name of wisdom LXXIL About this time a daring fraud was attempted at first with rapid success but in a short time totally defeated A man of low condition thought he might emerge from obscurity by taking upon him the name of Scribonianus Came rinus a His story was that during the reign of Nero to elude the fury of the times he had lain concealed in Istria where the followers of the antient Crassi still occupied the lands of their former masters and retained their veneration for that illustrious house To carry on this ridiculous farce the impostor engaged the vile and profligate in his interest The vul gar with their usual credulity and the soldiers either led into an error or excited by their love of innovation joined in the plot Their leader was seized and brought into the presence of Vitellius Being in terrogated who and what he was he was 296 THE HISTORY book found to be a fugitive slave of the name of vâ vâ Geta recognized as soon as seen by his A U C 822  master He was condemned to suffer the A D 69 death of a slave b in the manner in flicted by the law LXXIII Advice was at length re ceived from Syria and Judaea that the East submitted to the new emperor The pride with which Vitellius was bloated upon this occasion is scarcely credible Intelligence from that part of the world had been hitherto vague and uncertain but Vespasian was in the mouths of men and the rumour of the day filled the world with reports that sometimes roused Vitel lius from his lethargy He started at the name of Vespasian At length the cloud was blown over and a rival was no longer dreaded The emperor and his army plunged into every excess of cruelty lust and rapine as if a foreign tyranny and foreign manners had overturned the empire LXXIV Meanwhile Vespasian took a view of his own situation and weighed OF TACITDS 297 with care all possible events He consi book dered the importance of the war and made an estimate of his strength the resources in his power and the forces at a distance as well as those that lay near at hand The legions were devoted to his interest inso much that when he showed himself the first to swear fidelity to Vitellius and offer up vows for the prosperity of his reign the soldiers marked their displeasure by a sul len silence Mucianus was the friend of Titus and by no means averse from the father The praefect of iEgypt whose name was Alexander was ready to pro mote the enterprise The third legion which had been removed from Syria to Maesia Vespasian considered as his own and had besides good reason to hope that the forces in lllyricum would enter into the confederacy In fact the armies wherever stationed were every day more and more incensed against the soldiers that came amongst them from the Vitellian party  a set of men rough and horrid in their appearance savage in their man ners and in their brutal discourse affect ing to treat the legions of the East with 298 THE HISTORY book contempt and derision But in an enter prise of such importance it was natural to doubt and hesitate Vespasian re mained for some time in a state of sus pense now elate with hope and soon de pressed with fear  What an awful day  must that be when he should unsheath  the sword and commit himself at the  age of sixty with his two sons a in the  prime season of life to the danger of a  civil war  In undertakings of a private  nature men may advance or retreat as  they see occasion but when the contest  is for sovereign power there is no middle  course You must conquer or perish  in the attempt LXXV An officer of his experience was no stranger to the strength and valour of the German armies  The legions under  his command had not been tried in a war ft against their fellow citizens while on  the other hand the Vitellians added to  their experience all the pride of victory  The vanquished would undoubtedly  be dissatisfied but to murmur discon  tent was all that fortune left in their of TAcrrus 299  power In the rage of civil war the com book  mon soldier renounces every honest prin ciple treachery becomes habitual and  every man who sets no value on his own  life holds the chief in his power Cohorts  of foot and squadrons of horse make  a vain parade if one intrepid villain  for the reward promised by the adverse  party may strike a sudden blow and  by a murder terminate the war Such  was the fate of Scribonianus a in the  reign of Claudius he was murdered  by Volaginius a common soldier and  the highest posts in the service Avere  the wages of that desperate assassin  An army may be drawn up in order of  battle and to animate them to deeds of  valour is not a difficult task  but the  private ruffian is not easily avoided LXXVI Such were the reflections that presented themselves to the mind of Ves pasian His friends and the principal of ficers endeavoured to fix his resolution Mucianus lent his aid and not content with private conferences took a public opportunity to declare his sentiments in 300 THE HISTORY book effect as follows  V In all great and ardu Â ii  Â  ous undertakings the questions of iin  portance are Is the enterprise for the  good of the commonwealth  Will it do  honour to the man who conducted it   And are the difficulties such as wisdom  and valour may surmount  Nor is this  all the character of the man who  advises the measure should be duly  weighed Is he willing to second the  counsel which he gives at the hazard 41 of his life  What are his views  And  who is to reap the reward of victory  It  is Mucianus who now calls upon Ves  pasian Mucianus invites you to im  perial dignity for the good of the com  monwealth he invites you for your own glory he exhorts you to undertake the  enterprise The gods are with you  and under them the rest depends upon  yourself The advice which I give is  honest there is no flattery in it For  let me ask can it be flattery to prefer you to Vitellius  To be elected after such an emperor is rather a disgrace  With whom are we to conteud  Not with  the active mind of Augustus nor with OF TACITtJS 301  the craft of the politic Tiberius Not is it  against Caligula Claudius or Nero that  we propose to rise in arms They had  a kind of hereditary right their families  were in possession of the sovereignty  Even Galba could boast of an illustri  ous line of ancestors and for that reason  you were willing to acknowledge his  title But in the present juncture to 4 remain inactive and leave the common  wealth a prey to vice and infamy were  a desertion of the public which nothing can excuse Do you imagine that in a  state of servitude you can find your own  personal safety  Even in that case sub  mission would be attended with disgrace  and infamy But ambition is not now im  puted to you for the first time  you have  been long suspected and nothing re  mains but vigorous enterprise The so  vereign power is your only refuge Have  we forgot the fate of Corbulo Â It may  be said that the nobility of his birth su  perior it must be confessed to you as  well as myself exposed him to danger It may be so  but let it be remembered 302 THE HISTORY  that Nero towered above Vitellius  and  remember besides that in the eyes of the person who lives in fear the man who  makes himself dreaded is illustrious  Do we doubt whether the armies can  create an emperor  Vitellius furnishes  the proof a man without military fame  who never served a campaign but owes  his elevation not to his own merit but  to Galba s want of popularity His vic  tory was not obtained by the ability of  his generals or the valour of his troops  Otho was conquered by his own hand  That precipitate action made Vitellius  master of the Roman world and in re â turn the infamy of Vitellius gives a lustre  to the name of Otho insomuch that men  regret that unfortunate prince  At present what is the conduct of our  new emperor  He disbands the legions  he disarms the cohorts and every day  furnishes arms against himself The fe  rocity of his soldiers whatever it may  have been has long since evaporated in  victualling houses and drunken revelry â After the example of their master the 2 OP TACITUS 303  soldiers are dissolved in sloth and luxury  On the other hand you have in Syria  Judaea and iEgypt no less than nine  legions all high in spirit unimpaired by  war and not yet taught by sedition to  renounce all regard for discipline You  have an army enured to the operations  of war and crowned with victory over  the enemies of their country You have  a body of cavalry auxiliary cohorts a  naval armament and powerful kings  all devoted to your cause Above all M you have your own talents and your re  nown in arms LXXVII  To myself I arrogate no  thing yet let me not be thought inferior w to Valens or Caecina If Mucianus does  not aspire to be your rival you will not  therefore think meanly of him Willing  to yield to Vespasian I claim precedence  of Vitellius Your house has been di  stinguished by triumphal honours a  you have two sons and one of them 6  is already equal to the weight of empire  The German armies saw him give an  earnest of his future character Were I 304 THE HISTORY book  this very moment possessed of the sove  reign power I should call Titus my son by adoption with propriety therefore I yield to his father The enterprise to  which I exhort you will not in its con  sequences be the same to us both If  we succeed the honours which I may  receive must flow from you  in toil and  danger I am willing to be your rival or  if you will and it is the best expedient  remain here to issue your orders and  leave me to conduct the war  The troops that lately conquered are  by no means formidable In the van  quished party there is more order and  better discipline The latter stung with  shame and indignation are burning for  revenge All motives conspire to inflame  their ardour The Vitellians on the con  trary intoxicated with success ajid elate  with pride disdain all rules of subordi  nation They are undone by luxury  Their wounds as yet scarcely closed  will open in a new war and bleed afresh  My dependence it is true must be upon  your vigilance your ceconomy your wis op Tacitus Â 305  dom but I expect no less advantage book  from the ignorance the stupidity and  cruel disposition of Vitcllius In a word  war must be our choice to us it is safer  than peace for we have already deli  berated and he who deliberates has  rebelled LXXVIII By this animating speech all who assisted at the council were inspired with new confidence They pressed round Vespasian exhorting him to undertake the enterprise they recalled to his memory the responses of oracles a and the pre dictions of men skilled in judicial astro logy Nor was Vespasian untincturcd with that superstition Even afterwards when possessed of the supreme authority he retained a mathematician named Seleu cus to assist his councils with his insight into future events A number of progno stics that occurred to him in his youth came fresh in his mind He recollected a cypress tree of prodigious size on his own estate that fell suddenly to the ground and on the following day rose on the same spot and flourished in new strength VQL V X 306 THE IIISTORV and verdure This was considered by the interpreters of prodigies as an early pre lude to future grandeur At length hav ing obtained triumphal honours together with the consular rank when he had con ducted the war against the Jews with such rapid success the prediction seemed to be verified and thus encouraged he looked from that eminence to higher elevation and even to the imperial dignity Between Syria and Judvea stands a mountain known by the name of Mount Carmel b on the top of which a god is worshipped under no other title than that of the place and according to antient usao e without a tem pie or even a statue An altar is erected in the open air and there adoration is paid to the presiding deity On this spot Ves pasian offered a sacrifice In the midst of the ceremony while his mind expanded with vast ideas Basilides the officiating priest examined the entrails of the victims and in his prophetic manner addressing himself to Vespasian  Whatever he said  are your designs whether to build  a mansion to enlarge your estate Or in  crease the number of your slaves the OP TACITUS 307  fates prepare for you a vast and magni book  ficent seat with an immense territory  and a prodigious multitude of men This prediction though involved in my sterious language was spread abroad at the time and now received a favourable in terpretation The story gathered strength among the populace and in conversation with Vespasian was the favourite topic of his friends who thought they could not enlarge too much on the subject while the passions of the hearer stood ready to receive their advice LXXIX Mucianus and Vespasian settled their plan and took leave of each other the former went to Antioch the capital of Syria and the latter to Caesarea the metropolis of Judaea The first public step towards creating Vespasian emperor of Rome was taken at Alexandria in iEgypt Tiberius Alexander the praefect of the province eager to show his zeal ad ministered the oath to the legions under his command The ceremony was performed on the calends of July and that day was Â ver after celebrated as the first of

from Syria with dispatches from Mucianus but the impatience of the men could not brook the delay of waiting for the em peror s son The whole transaction origi nated with the soldiers and was hurried on with such violent impetuosity that the business was finished without any public harangue and even without a previous as sembly of the legions LXXX For this great revolution no arrangement was made no time no place was fixed nor was it known who was to be the author of the measure In this state of uncertainty while every bosom panted with hope and fear and the motives to the revolt with all the dangers that might en sue kept the army in agitation a small number of soldiers who mounted guard near the apartment of the general no sooner saw him coming forth from his chamber than with one voice they saluted him by the title of emperor The whole OF TACITUS 309 body followed their example They press ed forward in crowds calling him by the name of Caesar styling him Augustus and conferring every other title of imperial grandeur Vespasian balanced no longer His fears subsided and he now resolved to pursue the road of ambition Even in this tide of his affairs he still preserved the equal tenour of his mind free from arrogance and such in his manners as he had always been The new man never appeared The change as was natural dazzled his imagination but he took time to allay the hurry of his spirits and then calmly ad dressed the men in the language of a sol dier He was heard with shouts of ap plause Mucianus waited for this event On the first intelligence he declared for Vespasian and the soldiers with alacrity took the oath of fidelity to the new empe ror That business over Mucianus went to the theatre of Antioch where the inha bitants were used to hold their public de bates He found a crowded meeting and was received with acclamations He harangued the multitude and his 310 THE HISTORY â book speech though in Greek was eloquent In that language he had acquired suf ficient facility and he possessed besides the happy art a of giving grace and dig nity to whatever he uttered He inflamed the passions not only of the army but also of the province by asserting roundly  that it was a fixed point with Vitellius  to quarter the German troops in the de  lightful region of Syria that in a rich w and plentiful province they might grow  wanton in ease and luxury while in ex  change the legions of Syria were to be  removed to cold encampments in Ger  many there to endure the inclemency  of the weather and the rigours of the  service The natives of the province had lived in habits of friendship with the legions and by intermarriages had form ed family connections The soldiers on their part were naturalized in the country and the stations to which they were accus tomed were by long residence grown as dear to them as their native home LXXXI Before the ides of July the whole province of Syria acceded to Ves OF TACITUS 311 pasian His party was further strengthened book by Sohemus Â â who joined the league vâ vâ with the whole weight of his kingdom and sÂ s also by Antiochus who inherited immense Â Â treasures from his ancestors and was of all the kings who submitted to the autho rity of Rome the most rich and powerful Agrippa who was then at Rome received private expresses from the East request ing his presence in his own country He departed before Vitellius had any intelli gence and by a quick navigation passed over into Asia Queen Berenice at that time flourishing in the bloom of youth and no less distinguished by the graces of her person espoused the interest of Vespasian to whom notwithstanding his advanced age she had made herself agreeable by magnficent presents The several mari time provinces with Asia and Achaia and the whole inland country between Pontus and the two Armenias entered into the general confederacy but from the go vernors of those provinces no forces could be expected as they were not at that time strengthened by the legions stationed in Cappadocia To settle the plan of ope 312 THE HISTORY book ration a grand council was held at Bery tus b Mucianus attended He was ac companied by a train of officers tribunes and centurions and a considerable body of soldiers selected to swell the pomp and grandeur of the scene From Judaea the most distinguished officers went to the  meeting with the flower of their troops An assembly consisting of such a nume rous train of horse and foot and of eastern kings AvIio vied with each other in splen dour and magnificence presented a spec tacle worthy of the imperial dignity LXXXII The first and most important object was to raise recruits and recall the veterans to the service In all the strong and fortified cities workmen were ap pointed for the forging of arms and a mint for gold and silver coin was esta blished at A ntioch The Avhole was carried on with diligence under the direction of proper inspectors Vespasian visited every quarter by his presence giving spirit and animation to the cause He encouraged the industrious by the warmth of his com mendations  he roused the inactive by his OF TACITUS 313 example and succeeded more by gentle book methods than by the rigour of authority To the failings of his friends he was often blind but never to their virtues He ad vanced some to the administration of pro vinces and others to the rank of senators all men of distinguished character who rose afterwards to eminence in the state There were others who owed their success more to their good fortune than to their merit Mucianus in his first harangue made incidental mention of a donative but in guarded terms nor did Vespasian though engaged in a civil Avar grant at any time a larger bounty than had been usual in times of profound peace He chose that his soldiers should act on principles of honour not from motives of bribery and corruption To that firmness he owed the good order and regular discipline of his i_ army Ambassadors were sent to the courts of Parthia and Armenia in order to settle a mutual good understanding that when the legions marched forward to open the campaign the back settlements should not be exposed to sudden incursions of the enemy Titus was to remain in Judaea a 314 THE HISTORY book to complete the conquest of that country while Vespasian made himself master of the passes into iEgypt To make head against Vitellius part of the army waa deemed sufficient under the conduct of such a general as Mucianus with the ad ditional terror of Vespasian s name and the fates on his side superior to every dif ficulty Letters were dispatched to the se veral armies and the officers in command with instructions to conciliate the prae torian soldiers who had been disbanded by Vitellius and by a promise that all should be restored to their rank to invite them once more into the service LXXXIII Mucianus with the ap pearance rather of an associate in the so vereign power than of a general officer advanced at the head of a light armed de tachment never lingering in the course of his progress that delay might not be thought a symptom of irresolution and on the other hand not proceeding by rapid marches that fame might fly before him and spread the terror of his approach He knew the weakness of his numbers and OP TACITUS 315 that danger at a distance is always magni fied He was followed by the sixth legion and thirteen thousand veterans forming together a considerable army The fleet at Pontus had orders to assemble at By zantium That station was thought con venient as Mucianus had not yet deter mined whether he should not avoid the territory of Msesia and proceed in force to Dyrrhachium while his naval arma ment commanded the seas of Italy and by consequence protected the coasts of Achaia and Asia against the attempts of Vitellius who in that case would not only see Brundisium and Tarentum in danger but also the whole coast of Calabria and Lucania kept in a constant alarm LXXXIV Throughout the pro vinces nothing was heard but the din and bustle of warlike preparations Soldiers were assembling ships were preparing for sea and the clink of armourers re sounded in every quarter How to raise supplies of money was the chief difficulty Pecuniary funds Mucianus used to say were the sinews of war For this pur 8 316 THE HISTORY pose in all questions touching the sum demanded he regarded neither the truth nor the justice of the case To be rich was to be liable to taxation and money was to be raised in all events Informa tions followed without number and con fiscations without mercy Oppressive as these proceedings were the necessity of the times gave a colourable e xcuse but the misfortune was the practice did not cease with the war but continued in the season of profound peace to harass and oppress mankind Vespasian in the be ginning of his reign showed no disposi tion to enrich his coffers by acts of injus tice  but being corrupted afterwards by the smiles of fortune and listening to pernicious counsels he learned the arts of rapacity and dared to practise them a Mucianus from his own funds contri  buted to the exigencies of the Avar gene rous from Ins private purse that he might afterwards indemnify himself at the ex pense of the public The rest of the officers following his example advanced sums of money but were not in like manner repaid with usury OF TACITUS 317 LXXXV Vespasian in the mean book time saw his affairs assume a promising aspect The army in Illyrieum went over to his interest In Maesia the third legion revolted and drew after them the eighth and also the seventh called the Claudian  both devoted to Otho though not en gaged in the action at Bedriacum Before the battle they had advanced as far as Aquileia  and being at that place in formed of a total overthrow they as saulted the messengers who brought the news broke to shivers the standards that displayed the name of Vitellius plun dered the military chests and having divided the spoil proceeded to every act of outrage and sedition Conscious of that offence and dreading the punishment that might follow they consulted toge ther and clearly saw that what thejr had done required a pardon from Vitellius but with Vespasian stood in the light of real merit To strengthen their cause they sent dispatches to the army in Pan nonia inviting them to join the league  determined if they did not comply to compel them by force of arms In this 318 THE HISTORY book juncture Aponius Saturninus a gover nor of Maesia conceived the design of perpetrating a barbarous murder Under colour of public zeal but with malice festering at his heart he dispatched a centurion to murder Tertius Julianus who commanded the seventh legion That officer had timely notice He provided himself with guides who knew the course of the country and escaped through de vious tracks as far as Mount Haemus From that time he took no part in the civil war He affected often to be on the point of setting out to join Vespasian but delayed his journey at times seeming eager to depart then doubting hesita ting waiting for intelligence and du ring the whole war resolving without decision LXXXVI In Pannonia the thir teenth legion and the seventh called the Galbian embraced the interest of Ves pasian They still remembered with in dignation their defeat at Bedriacum and the influence of Antonius Primus proved a powerful instigation That officer con W Tacitus 319 victed of forgery a in the reign of Nero book remained obnoxious to the laws till among the evils that spring from civil dissension he rose from infamy to his senatorian rank He was advanced by Galba to the command of the seventh legion and according to report offered himself to Otho desiring by letters the rank of general against his benefactor Otho paid no attention to the proposal and by consequence Antonius remained inactive In the present juncture seeing a storm ready to burst upon Vitellius he veered round to Vespasian and became the grand support of the party To his vices he united great and useful qualities brave and valiant he possessed uncom mon eloquence an artful and insidious enemv he had the art of involving others in danger in popular insurrections a bold and turbulent leader at once a plunderer and a prodigal what he gained by rapine he squandered in corruption  during the calm season of peace a per nicious citizen in war an officer not to be neglected 320 THE HisToar The armies of Maesia and Pannonia formed a junction and drew the forces of Dalmatia into the revolt The con sular governors of those provinces were neutral on the occasion they took no share in the business nor did the soldiers wait for their direction Titus Ampius Flavianus ruled in Pannonia and Pop paeus Silvanus in Dalmatia both rich and advanced in years Cornelius Fuscus descended from illustrious ancestor and then in the vigour of life was at the same time imperial procurator In his youth he had resigned his senatorian rank to seek in solitude a retreat from public business Joining afterwards with Galba he drew forth in support of that emperor the strength of his own colony and for his services obtained the post of procu rator In the present commotions he declared for Vespasian and by his ardent spirit gave life and vigour to the cause Self interest did not mix with the motives that determined his conduct His pride was in the field of action He gloried in facing danger and despised OF TACITUS 321 the reward of merit War was his pas sion  and though possessed of an ample fortune he preferred a life of enterprise to indolence and his own personal safety He acted in concert with Antonius Pri mus and both exerted themselves to kindle the flame of war in every quarter Where they saw a discontented spirit they were sure to increase it by infusions of their own venom They sent dispatches to the fourteenth legion in Britain and to the first in Spain knowing that both had favoured the cause of Otho against Vitellius Their letters were spread all over Gaul and by their joint efforts the Roman world was roused to arms The forces in Illyricum declared for Vespasian and in other parts as soon as the first blow was struck the troops stood ready to take the field LXXXVII While Vespasian and the leaders of his party were thus employed in concerting measures throughout the provinces Vitellius sunk in sloth and growing every day more contemptible advanced by slow marches towards the vol v Y 522 THE HISTORY book city of Rome In all the villas and mu nicipal towns through which he passed carousing festivals were sufficient to retard a man abandoned to his pleasures He was followed by an unwieldy multitude not less than sixty thousand men in arms all corrupted by a life of debauchery The number of retainers and followers of the army was still greater all disposed to riot and insolence even beyond the na tural bent of the vilest slaves To these must be added a train of officers and servile courtiers too haughty to be re strained within due bounds even though the chief had practised the strictest dis cipline The crowd was still increased by a conflux of senators and Roman knights who came from Rome to greet the prince on his way  some impelled by fear others to pay their court and numbers not to be thought sullen or disaffected yA went with the current The populace rushed forth in crowds accompanied by an infamous band of pimps of players buffoons and charioteers by their utility in vicious pleasures all well known and dear to Vitellius Such were the dis OP TACITUS 323 graceful connections of the emperor and book he enjoyed them without a blush To supply so vast a body with provisions the colonies and municipal cities were exhausted the fruits of the earth then ripe and fit for use were carried off the husbandman was plundered and his land as if it were an enemy s country was laid waste and ruined LXXXVIII The fierce animosity that broke out at Ticinum between the legions and the auxiliaries was not yet extin guished Frequent quarrels occurred and ended always in mutual slaughter Against the peasants and farmers they were sure to be unanimous but agreed in nothing else The most dreadful carnage happened within seven miles of Rome At that place Vitellius ordered victuals read dressed to be distributed among the soldiers as if he had prepared a feast to pamper a band of gladiators The common people who had come in crowds from Rome were dispersed through the camp To divert themselves with what they thought an arch and pleasant trick y 2 324 THE HISTORY book they cut away the belts of the soldiers and with an air of humour asked Whether they were properly accoutred The sol diers had no taste for raillery They re taliated with their weapons and fell with fury on the defenceless multitude Among the slain was the father of one of the sol diers killed as he stood engaged in con versation with his son The unhappy victim was soon known and by that in cident the further effusion of blood was prevented Rome in the mean time was thrown into consternation A number of soldiers entered the city in a tumultuous manner and rushed forward to the forum impatient to see the spot where Galba perished Covered with the skins of savage beasts and wielding large and massy spears the spectacle which they exhibited to the Roman citizens was fierce and hideous Unused to crowded streets they had not the skill to con duct themselves amidst a vast concourse of people but with rude force pushed against the passengers  and sometime slipping down or as might happen thrown by the pressure of the throng they â i â OF TACITUfr  325 rose hastily to resent what was no more boo than an accident and from abusive lan guage proceeded sword in hand to the most violent outrages The tribunes and centurions at the head of their troops of cavalry paraded the streets in a war like manner and spread a general panic through the city LXXXIX Vitellius himself in his military apparel mounted on a superb horse advanced from the Milvian bridge while the senate and the people pressed on before him to make way for their new master His friends however remon strated against his making a public entry in a military style like a conqueror march ing into a city taken by storm He con formed to their advice and having put on his senatorian robe made his entry in a pacific manner His troops followed in regular order The eagles of four legions led the way with an equal number of standards on each side The colours of twelve squadrons of horse were displayed with great pomp The infantry followed and after them the cavalry The pro 326 THE HISTORY book cession was closed by four and thirty cohorts distinguished by the arms and habits of their respective nations The prefects of the camp the tribunes and principal centurions arrayed in white preceded their several eagles The rest of the officers marched at the head of their companies The blaze of arms and rich apparel added splendour to the scene The burnished collars of the common men and the trappings of the horses glit tered to the eye while the whole presented a magnificent spectacle worthy of a bet ter emperor In this manner Vitellius proceeded to the capitol and there em bracing his mother o saluted her by the name of Augusta 3 XC On the following day Vitellius delivered a public harangue and spoke of himself in magnificent terms as if he had for his audience the senate and people of â a foreign city He assumed the virtues of industry and temperance never con sidering that he was in the hearing of men who had seen his vices and that every part of Italy through which he had OF TACITUS 327 1L a u c a n passed had known and felt his aban book doncd profligacy The populace as usual knowing neither truth nor falsehood and  indifferent about both paid their tribute 09 of flattery with noise and uproar They pressed him to accept the title of Au gustus he declined it for some time but the voice of the rabble prevailed He yielded to their importunity  but his com pliance was useless and the honour was of short duration XCI In a city where superstition in terpreted every thing the first act of Yi tellius in the character of sovereign pontiff was considered as an omen that portended mischief He issued an edict concerning the rights and ceremonies of religion dated the fifteenth before the calends of August a day rendered inaus picious by two victories formerly obtained over the armies of Rome  one at Creme ra a and the other at Allia But Vitellius was unacquainted with the antiquities of his country He knew nothing of laws either human or divine The same stu pidity possessed his friends and his band 328 THE HISTORY of freedmen The whole court seemed to be in a state of intoxication In the as semblies held for the election of con suls b Vitellius assumed nothing above the rights of a citizen He behaved to the candidates on a footing of equality He attended in the theatre giving his ap plause as a common spectator and in the circus mixing with the factions of the populace By those arts he tried to gain the suffrages of the electors arts it must be acknowledged often practised and when subservient to honest purposes not to be condemned But in a man like Vitellius whose former life was too well known c the artifice served only to sink him into contempt He went frequently to the senate even on frivolous occasions when the subject of debate was altogether uninteresting In that assembly Helvidius Priscus d praetor elect happened to differ from the opinion of the emperor Vitellius took fire in the moment but checking himself in time called upon the tribunes of the people to support his authority His friends apprehending the consequences OF TACITUS 329 of a deep and smothered resentment in book terposed with their good offices to soften prejudice His answer was  Nothing  new has happened two senators have differed in opinion and is not that a  common occurrence  I have myself  often opposed the sentiments of Thra  sea e The allusion to a character so truly eminent provoked a smile of contempt Some however were glad to find that instead of the men who glit tered in the sunshine of a court he chose Thrasea for the model of true greatness XCII Publius Sabinus the praefect of a cohort and Julius Priscus a centu rion were advanced from those inferior stations to the command of the praetorian guards The former owed his elevation to the friendship of Valens and the latter to that of Caecina By those two mi nisters though always at variance with each other the whole power of the state was usurped and exercised The autho rity of the emperor was merely nominal Valens and Caecina transacted every thing Their mutual animosity which had been suppressed during the war but not ex 330 THE HISTORY tinguished broke out at Rome with re doubled violence Their friends with of ficious care envenomed the minds of the rival statesmen and the various factions that for ever distract the city of Rome furnished every day new materials to in flame their jealousy They vied with each other for pre eminence and by intrigue by cabal by their train of followers and their crowded levees endeavoured to mani fest their superiority while Vitellius wavered between both and as his inclina tions shifted the balance changed alter nately from one to the other Their au thority exceeded all bounds and was therefore like all ill gotten power un certain and precarious They saw the caprice that marked the character of Vi tellius one moment inflamed with anger and the next lavish of his favours Nei ther of the ministers could be sure of fixing the affections of his master and both despised and feared him Nothing however could satisfy their rapacity  they seized houses gardens and the whole wealth of the empire while a number of illustrious men whom Galba OP TACITUS 331 had recalled from banishment were left book to languish in distress and poverty Their situation awakened no compassion in the breast of the emperor He restored them it is true to their rights over their freed men and by that act of justice not only gratified the senators and other grandees of the city but also gained the applause of the populace But even this show of benignity was rendered useless by the low cunning that marks the genius of slavery To evade the claims of their patrons the freedmen concealed their wealth in ob scure places or else deposited it in the custody of the great Some of them con trived to insinuate themselves into the im perial family and there growing into favour looked down with pride and in solence on their disappointed masters XCIII The multitude of soldiers was so enormous that the camp overflowed and poured the redundant numbers into the city a wild disorderly band who fixed their station in the public porticos and even in the temples The men wandered about the streets of Rome so utterly care 1 333 THE HISTORY book less that they forgot where they were quartered Having no regular place of rendezvous and performing no kind of duty they gave themselves up to the dis solute manners of the city and the prac tice of vices too foul to be named In this course of life their bodily strength decayed the vigour of their minds was sunk in sloth and their health entirely neglected They chose for their abode the most vile and infamous places in the neighbourhood of the Vatican a where they contracted diseases till an epidemic distemper began to rage amongst them A dreadful mortality followed The Gauls and Germans suffered most by their own imprudence Infected with disor ders inflamed with fevers and being na turally impatient of heat they plunged into the Tiber which unluckily was near at hand and took delight in cooling their limbs which proved a remedy as bad as the disease The confusion introduced by another circumstance proved the bane of the army It was thought advisable to raise sixteen cohorts b for the praetorian camp and four for the city each to con OF TACITUS 533 sist of a thousand men This measure by book cabals among the soldiers and the jea lousy subsisting between the two com manding officers was the ruin of all discipline Valens arrogated to himself the chief direction of the business He had relieved Caecina and his army and on that account claimed pre eminence The Vitellian party had certainly gained no advantage over the enemy till the arrival of Valens gave life and vigour to the cause If the slowness of his march was at first liable to censure the victory that followed made ample atonement and re deemed the character of the general The soldiers from the Lower Germany were to a man devoted to his interest It was upon this occasion according to the ge neral opinion that Cuecina first began to meditate the treachery which he after wards carried into execution XCIV The indulgence shown by Vi tellius to his principal officers was ex ceeded by nothing but the licentiousness of the common soldiers Each man en rolled himself in what company he thought 334 THE HISTORY a A U C  8SS A D book proper and chose his own station in the service Some preferred the city co horts and without considering merit or Â fitness for that employment their wish was gratified Others who ought to have been selected were suffered at their own will and pleasure to continue in the le gions or the cavalry This was the choice of numbers who had impaired their con stitutions and were therefore willing to remove from the sultry heats of Italy to a more temperate climate By these ar rangements the main strength of the legions and the cavalry was drafted away A motley body of twenty thousand men Avas formed out of the whole army with out choice or judgment The conse quence was that the camp retained nei ther the strength nor the beauty of mili tary system Vitellius thought fit to harangue the soldiers In the midst of his speech a clamour broke out demanding the ex Â ecution of Asiaticus and of Flavius and llufinus who bad been commanders in Caul and listed on the side of Vindex  OF TACITUS 335 Nor did Vitellius endeavour to appease book the tumult From his sluggish temper nothing like firmness or authority could be expected He knew that the time for dis charging the promised donative was draw ing near and having no funds to answer the expectation of the soldiers he thought it his best policy to atone by mean com pliances for that deficiency In order however to raise supplies a tax was im posed on all the freedmen of former em perors to be collected in proportion to the number of their slaves To squander with wild profusion was the only use of money known to Vitellius He built a set of stables for the charioteers and kept in the circus a constant spectacle of gladiators and wild beasts in this man ner dissipating with prodigality as if his treasury overflowed with riches XCV CjECisfA and Valens resolved to celebrate the birthday a of their mas ter with all demonstrations of joy They gave a show of gladiators in every quarter of the city with a display of pomp av d magnificence beyond all

gave disgust to all who had any principle or a spark of remaining virtue Victims were slain fires were kindled and the torch was carried by the Augustan priests ah order dedicated by Tiberius to the Julian family in imitation of that conse crated by Romulus to Tatius b the Sabine king From the victory at Bedriacum four months had not elapsed and yet in that short time Asiaticus the manumitted slave of the emperor had already accu mulated riches nothing short of the Poly cleti the Patrobii and others of the ser vile race whose names have been given up to the execration of mankind The court of Vitellius was not the scene of honest emulation No man endeavoured to rise by his virtue or his talents The road to preferment was open to vice and luxury He who entertained the prince in the gayest manner and with S mptuous banquets glutted that craving appetite was sure to be in favour To OF TACITUS 337 enjoy the present hour and seize with book avidity the pleasures near at hand was vâ â the whole occupation of Vitellius Future 822 events and distant consequences gave him eÂ no solicitude He is said to have dis sipated in a few months no less than nine millions of sesterces Such was the sad condition of Home a great yet mise rable city obliged in the space of one 3 ear to groan under the yoke of an Otho and a Vitellius and still worse to suffer the depredations of Vinius Valens Icelus and Asiaticus till the people were at length transferred like a herd of slaves to Mucianus and Marcellus c New men succeeded but the measures were still the same XCVI The first intelligence of a re volt that reached the ear of Vitellius was that of the third legion in lllyricum The account was sent by Aponius Satur ninus before that officer had formed his resolution to join Vespasian His di spatches made up in the first tumult of surprise did not state the whole of the mischief The creatures of the court to vol v z N 338 THE HISTORY book sooth their master endeavoured to palliate every circumstance They called it the seditious spirit of one legion only while every other army preserved unshaken fide lity and there was therefore no danger to be apprehended Vitellius addressed the soldiers to the same effect He added that the praetorians lately disbanded were the authors of false reports fabri cated with a seditious intent to disturb the public peace but still there was no reason to fear a civil war He made no mention of Vespasian and to suppress all talk among the populace a band of soldiers had orders to parade the streets The policy however did not answer the end Silence was commanded and the people talked with greater freedom XCVII Dispatches were notwith standing sent to Germany to Spain and Britain for a supply of men but as Vi tellius wished to conceal the urgency of his affairs his orders were not decisive and by consequence the governors of the provinces were in no haste to obey Hor deonius Flaccus Â who commanded on 3 OF TACITUS 339 the banks of the Rhine having reason to book fear the designs of the Batavians expected â vâ to have a war upon his hands b and 822 therefore thought it prudent not to dhni 69 nish his force In Britain Vectius Bo lanus was kept in a constant alarm by the reestless gnius of the natives At the same time those two officers began to balance between Vitellius and Vespasian Spain showed no alacrity That country left without a governor of proconsular autho rity was under the direction of three com manders of legions all equal in rank and all willing as long as Vitellius flourished in prosperity to hold their employments under him but in the day of distress ready to abandon his cause Affairs in Africa wore a better aspect The legion and the cohorts which had been raised in that country by Clodius Macer and dis banded by Galba were again embodied by order of Vitellius and the young men of the nation went in crowds to be enrolled in the service The fact was Vitellius and Vespasian had been proconsuls in Africa  the former governed with modera tion and was remembered with gratitude  7 2 340 the HistonY book the latter incurred the hatred of the peo pie c From past transactions the pro vince and the allies in the neighbourhood formed their idea of what they had to ex pect under the reign of either of them but the event convinced them of their error XCVIII The exertions in Africa were at first carried on with vigour Valerius Festus the governor of the province co operated with the zeal of the people but in a short time began to waver between the contending parties In his letters and public edicts he stood firm for Vitellius his secret correspondence favoured Vespa sian  and by this duplicity he hoped in the end to make terms for himself with the conqueror In Rhajtia and the adja cent parts of Gaul certain emissaries em ployed by Vespasian s friends were seized with letters and proclamations in their possession They were sent to Vitellius and by his order put to death Others by their own address or the protection of their friends escaped detection The con sequence was that the measures adopted 4 OP TACITUS 341 by Vitellius were known to the opposite book party while those of Vespasian remained â Iâ Â an impenetrable secret The stupidity of 822  Vitellius gave the enemy this advantage Â in the outset Afterwards when the passes over the Pannonian Alps a were secured by a chain of posts all intelligence by land was entirely cut off and by sea the Etesian winds that favoured the naviga tion to the east were adverse to the home ward voyage XCIX Vitellius finding that the advanced parties of the enemy had made an irruption into Italy and news big with danger arriving from every quarter gave orders to his generals to take the field without delay Caecina undertook the command while Valens who was just risen from a sick bed remained at Rome for the recovery of his health The Ger man forces marching out of the city ex hibited an appearance very different frorrl the ferocity of their first approach Their strength wasted their vigour of mind depressed their numbers thinned their horses slow and lifeless their arms an in 342 THE HISTORY book cumbrance and the men drooping under the heat of the season overpowered by the dust and unable to endure the wea ther presented to all who beheld their march a languid spiritless and dejected army averse from labour and for that reason ready to revolt The character of Caecina must be taken into the account Ambition was his ruling passion sloth and indolence the effect of success and luxury were vices newly con tracted  or perhaps meditating even then a stroke of perfidy it was part of his plan to countenance whatever tended to im pair the vigour of the army The revolt of this commander has been ascribed by various writers to Flavius Sabinus who had the address by the means of Rubrius Callus his intermediate agent to seduce Caecina to the interest of his brother un der positive assurances that the terms sti mulated between them would be ratified by Vespasian The jealousy subsisting between Caecina and Valens had its effect on the mind of an aspiring chief who saw his rival in the highest credit with Vitel OF TACITUS 343 lius and was therefore easily persuaded book to merit the protection of a new prince C Cecina took leave of Vitellius and received at parting the highest marks of distinction He sent forward a de tachment of the cavalry to take possession of Cremona The veterans of the four teenth a and sixteenth legions followed and after them the fifth and twenty second The rear was closed by the twenty first distinguished by the name of Rapax and the first legion called the Italic with the vexillaries of three British legions and the flower of the auxiliary forces Caecina was no sooner set out on his expedition than Valens sent directions to the army which he had conducted into Italy to wait for his arrival according to the plan which he said was settled between him self and Caecina But the latter being on the spot and by consequence having greater weight and influence assured the men that upon mature deliberation that whole plan had been altered to the end that they might meet the first impression of the enemy with the united vigour of 344 THE HISTORY book the army â Having thus secured in his own hands the whole command he or dered the legions to proceed by rapid marches to Cremona while a large de tachment went forward to Hostilia  He himself turned off towards Ravenna under a pretence of conferring with the officers of the fleet but in fact with a design to make the best of his way to the city of Pavia judging that place the fittest for a treasonable convention He there met Lucilius Bassus c a man who from a squadron of horse had been raised by Vitellius to the command of two fleets one at Ravenna and the other at Mise num Not content with that sudden rise he thought himself entitled to be made praefect of the praetorian guards That disappointment he considered as an in jury and therefore resolved to gratify his unjust resentment by a stroke of perfi dy For this purpose he joined Caecina Which seduced the other cannot now be known Two evil minds might form the same black design and having formed it they would find in congenial qualities a secret impulse to each other OF TACITUS 345 CI In the memoirs of various authors book who composed their work during the reign of the Flavian family a we are told that Caecina acted on the most upright princi ples with a view to the public tranquil lity and the good of his country But this seems to be the language of flattery to the reigning prince The conduct of Caecina may be fairly traced to other mo tives The natural inconstancy of the man and after his treachery to Galba the confirmed habit of betraying without a blush would be sufficient to remove all doubt if we had not to add to the ac count his disappointed ambition and the corrosions of envy with which he saw himself eclipsed by the superior genius of his rival Rather than be supplanted by others in the esteem of Vitellius the ruin of that emperor was his remedy Having settled his plan of operations with Bassus Caecina once more put him self at the head of the legions and by va rious artifices began to undermine the in terest of Vitellius and wean the centurions and soldiers from all affection for his per 346  THE HISTORY OF

battle of Actium it is properly the history of the emperors c Tacitus was probably raised to the office of quse stor by Vespasian and perhaps to the senatorian rank Under Titus he advanced in the regular gradation of the magistracy to the functions either of tribune or sedile and in the time of Domitian he was one of the quinde cimviral college as well as prsetor See Annals xi ft 11 d It is

the gth of the kalends of April which answers to the 24th of March See Suetonius Life of Otho s 8 NOTES ON THE SECOND BOOK OF THE HISTORY Section I a THACITUS says that fortune was then laying the foundation of a new imperial house which proved to be beneficial and disastrous to the people and also to the very family that was raised to that pre emi nence This is perfectly clear when we consider that Rome was happy under Vespasian and Titus but groaned under Domhian till the tyrant was destroyed and the Flavian line was extinguished b Titus at this time was in his twenty eighth year By the favour of Narcissus to whom Vespasian paid his court Titus was educated in the palace with Britannicus the son of Claudius The prince then destined by his father to succeed to the empire was cut off by the vil lany of Nero and Titus whose elevation was not then foreseen lived to be the delight of the Roman people c Suetonius tells us that Narcissus the favourite freedman consulted a fortune teller about the destiny of Britannicus  the answer was unfavourable fo the young prince but assured Titus that he was born to the impe rial dignity Suetonius in Tito s 2 SECOND BOOK OF THE HISTORY 369 Section II a Berenice was sister to Agrippa II and wife of Herod king of Chalcis in Syria For more of her and her connexion with Titus see Appendix to Hist v s 21 b When Titus no longer sails along the coast but puts off to sea Tacitus calls it a bolder voyage audentio ribus spatiis an expression which in the present state of navigation may provoke the smile of a mariner The compass was not invented and men did not like to lose sight of the shore c At the town of Paphos which stood on the western sideof the isle of Cyprus a temple was dedicated to Venus thence called the Paphian Venus The account of the rites and ceremonies which Tacitus gives us has been condemned by some critics as an idle digression but when it is considered that the history of superstition was not uninteresting to the Romans this passage will not be thought improper The great historian has been charged with irreligion but the attention shown on this occasion and many others to the various modes of worship may serve to vindicate his character Section III a Aerias has been mentioned in another place as the founder of the Paphian temple Annals iii s 63 Tacitus adds that the name of Aerias was applied by many to the goddess herself and accordingly Pausa nias lib i cap 14 calls her Ovgavlav b Cinyras is said by Apollodorus to have been one of the kings of Assyria c Thamiras introduced the science of augury which was founded altogether in deceit and fraud Accor dingly we find that care was taken to keep it in the VOL V 2 B 370 NOTES ON THE hands of two families that the secret of the

Venus as the parent of the whole animal creation was of antient date and known for ages to the Assyrians The rude state of sculpture may perhaps account for the representation of the goddess as described by Tacitus Clemens of Alexan dria makes that observation The statuary he says had not the skill to give the elegance of symmetry and proportion he therefore left the form and delicacy of Venus to the imagination As Ovid says si qua latent meliora putat Section IV a The rapid success of Vespasian had well nigh ended the Jewish war Jerusalem was the only place that held out See the

accuracy See quarto edition vol iii p 408 A compendious view of what he has said on the subject will perhaps be ac ceptable  as it will show the whole strength of the em pire in the important crisis now before us The names of the several legions were as follow 1 Legio Prima the first legion 2 Legio Prima Italica the first Italic legion raised by Nero as appears in Dio lib lv 3 Legio Prima Adjutrix an additional legion according to Dio raised by Nero from the marines and for that reason called Legio Prima Adjutrix Classi corum 4 Legio Secunda the second legion 5 Legio Secunda Adjutrix

Varus and also the last formed out of the ma rines by Vitellius and heard of no more it will appear that in the beginning of the ensuing wars the military establishment exclusive of the forces in Italy consisted of Thirty Legions Their stations were as follows  In Britain  The second ninth twentieth In Spain tit8  The first Adjutrix the sixth the tenth In Gaul The first Italic yFN y in i ower

so small a number of legions should be able not only to conquer but to keep in subjection the wide extent of the Roman world might be matter of wonder if we did not know the wisdom with which the legions were established and the military discipline that was for a number of ages strictly maintained throughout the Roman armies Brotier observes that Marshal Saxe whose extraordinary genius and
