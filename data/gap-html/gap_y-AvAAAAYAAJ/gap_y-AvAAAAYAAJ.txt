interval of Fourteen Years From ike Death of Alexander and Arhtobulus to the Banishment of Archelaus CHAP I flow intipater was hated by alt the nation of the 5 wr for the slaughter of his brethren  and how for that reason he got into peculiar favour with his friends at Rome by giving them many presents  as he did also with Saturninus the pre sident of Syria and the governors who were under him y and concerning Herod s wives and children Si VTT HEN Antipater had thus taken off his brethren and Â  had brought his father into the highest degree of impiety till he was haunted with furies for what he had done his hopes did not succeed to his mind as to the rest of his life  for although he was delivered from the fear of his brethren be HI A ing 2 ANTIQJJITIES OF THE JEWS Book XVII ing his rivals as to the government yet did he find it a very hard thing and almost impracticable to come at the kingdom be cause the hatred of the nation against him on that account was become very great  and besides this very disagreeable cir cumstance the affair of the soldiery grieved him still more who were alienated from him from which yet these kings derived all the safety which they had whenever they found the nation desirous of innovation  and all this danger was drawn upon him by his destruction of his brethren How ever he governed the nation jointly with his father being in deed no other than a king already  and he was for that very reason trusted and the more firmly depended on for the which he ought himself to have been put to death as appear ing to have betrayed his brethren out of his concern for the preservation of Herod and not rather out of his ill will to them and before them to his father himself and this was the accursed state he was in Now all Antipater s contri vances tended to make his way to take off Herod that he might have nobody to accuse him in the vile practices he was devising  and that Herod might have no refuge nor any to afford him their assistance since they must thereby have An tipater for their open enemy  insomuch that the very plots he had laid against his brethren were occasioned by the hatred he bore his father But at this time he was more than ever set upon the execution of his attempts against Herod because if he were once dead the government would now be firmly se cured to him  but if he were suffered to live any longer he should be in danger upon a discovery of that wickedness of which he had been the contriver and his father would of ne cessity then become his enemy And on this account it was that he became very bountiful to his father s friends and be stowed great sums on several of them in order to surprise men with his good deeds and take off their hatred against him And he sent great presents to his friends at Rome parti cularly to gain their good will and above all to Saturninus the president of Syria He also hoped to gain the favour of Saturninus s brother with the large presents he bestowed on him  as also he used the same art to Salome the king s sis ter who had married one of Herod s chief friends Arid when he counterfeited friendship to those with whom he con versed he was very subtle in gaining their belief and very  cunning to hide his hatred against any that he really did hate But he could not impose upon his aunt who understood him of a long time and was a woman not easily to be deluded especially while she bad already used all possible caution iii preventing Chap I THE ANTIQJJITIES Of THE JEWS   S preventing his pernicious designs Although Antipafer s uncle by the mother s side were married to her daughter and this by his own connivance and management while she had before been married to Aristobulus and while Salome s other daughter by that husband were married to the son of Calleas  yet that marriage was no obstacle to her who knew how wicked he was in her discovering his designs as her former kindred to him could not prevent her hatred of him Now Herod had compelled Salome while she was in love with Syl leus the Arabian and had taken a fondness for him to marry Alexas which match was by her submitted to at the instance of Julia who persuaded Salome not to refuse it lest she should herself be their open enemy since Herod had sworn that he would never be friends with Salome if she would not accept of Alexas for her husband  so she submitted to Julia as being Caesar s wife and besides that she advised her to nothing but what was very much for her own advantage At this time also it was that Herod sent back King Archelaus s daughter who had been Alexander s wife to her father re turning tiie portion he had with her out of his own estate that there might be no dispute between them about it Now Herod brought up his son s children with great care  for Alexander had two sons by Glaphyra  and Aristobulus had three sons by Bernice Salome s daughter and two daugh ters  and as his friends were one with him he presented the children before them  and deploring the hard fortune of his own sons he prayed that no such ill fortune would befal these who were their children but that they might improve in vir tue and obtain what they justly deserved and might make him amends for his care of their education He also caused them to be betrothed against they should come to the proper age of marriage  the elder of Alexander s sons to Pheroras s daughter and Antipater s daughter to Aristobulus s eldest son He also allotted one of Aristobulus s daughters to An tipater s son and Aristobulus s other daughter to Herod a son of his own who was born to him by the high priest s daughter  for it is the ancient practice among us to have many wives at the same time Now the king made these espousals for the children out of commiseration of them now they were fatherless as endeavouring to render Antipater kind to them by these intermarriages But Antipater did not fail to bear the same temper of mind to his brothers children which he had borne to his brothers themselves  and his fa ther s concern about them provoked his indignation against â them upon this supposal that they would become greater than A 2  ever 4 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XVII ever his brothers had been  while Archelaus a king would support his daughter s sons and Pheroras a tetrarch would accept of on of the daughters as a wife to his son What provoked him also was this that all the multitude would so commiserate these fatherless children and so hate him for making them fatherless that all would come out since they Were no strangers to his vile disposition towards his brethren He contrived therefore to overturn his father s settlements as thinking it a terrible thing that they should be so related to him and be so powerful withal So Herod yielded to him and changed his resolution at his intreaty  and the determina tion now was that Antipater himself should marry Aristobu lus s daughter and ntipater s son should marry Pheroras s daughter So the espousals for the marriages were changed after this manner even without the king s real approbation Now Herod the king had at this time nine wives one of them Antipater s mother and another the high priest s daugh ter by whom he had a son of his own name He had also one who was his brother s daughter and another his sister s daughter  which two had no children One of his wives also was of the Samaritan nation whose sons were Antipas and Archelaus and whose daughter was Olympias  which daugh ter was afterward married to Joseph the king s brother s son but Archelaus and Antipas were brought up with a certain private man at Rome Herod had also to wife Cleopatra of Jerusalem and by her he had his sons Herod and Philip  which last was also brought up at Rome Pallas also was one of his wives which bare him his son Phasaelus And besides these he had for his wives Phedra and Elpis by whom he had his daughters Roxana and Salome As for his elder daughters by the same mother with Alexander and Aristobu lus and whom Pheroras neglected to marry he gave the one in marriage to Antipater the king s sister s son and the ether to Phasaelus his brother s son And this was the posterity of Herod CHAP  Those who

II Concerning Zamaris the Babylonian Jew Concerning the plots laid by Antipater against bis father  and somewhat about the Pharisees Â 1 A ND now it was that Herod being desirous of secu f t ring himself on the side of the Trachonites resolved fo build a village as large as a city for the Jews in the middle of that country which might make his own country difficult to be assaulted and whence he might be at hand to make sallies upon them and do them a mischief Accordingly when he understood that there was a maa that was a Jew coine out of Babylon with five hundred horsemen all of whom could shoot their arrows as they rode on horseback and with an hundred of his relations had passed over Euphrates and now abode at Antioch by Daphne of Syria where Saturni nus who was then president had given them a place for ha bitation called Valatha he sent for this man with the mul titude that followed him and promised to give him land in the toparchy called Batanca which country is bounded with Trachonites as desirous to make that his habitation a guard to himself He also engaged to let h m hold the country free from tribute and that they should dwell entirely without pay ing such customs as used to be paid and gave it him tax cfree 2 The Babylonian was induced by theae offers to come hi ther  so he took possession of the land and built in it for tresses and a village and named it Bathyra Whereby this tnan became a safeguard to the inhabitants against the Tra chonites and preserved those Jews who came out of Babylon to offer their sacrifices at Jerusalem from being hurt by the Trachonite robberies  so that a great number came to him from all those parts where the ancient Jewish laws were ob served and the country became full of people by reason of their universal freedom from taxes This continued during the life of Herod  but when Philip who was tetrarch after him took the government he made them pay some small taxes and that for a little while only  and Agrippa the Great and his son of the same name although they harassed them greatly yet would they not take their liberty away From whom when the Romans have now taken the government into their own hands they still gave them the privilege of their freedom but oppress them entirely with the imposition 1 â of Hi ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XVII cf taxes Of which matter I shall treat more accurately in the progress of this history  3 At length Zamaris the Babylonian to whom Herod had given that country for a possession died  having lived vir tuously and left children of a good character behind him one of whom was Jacim who was famous for his valour and taught his Babylonians how to ride their horses  and a troop  of them were guards to the fore mentioned kings And when Jzicim was dead in his old age he left a son whose name was Philip one of great strength in his hands and in other re spects also more eminent for his valour than any of his con temporaries  on which account there was a confidence and firm friendship between him and King Agrippa He had also an army which he maintained as great as that of a king  which he exercised and led wheresoever he had occasion to inarch 4 When the affairs of Herod were in the condition I have described all the public affairs depended upon Antipater  and his power was such that he could do good turns to as many as he pleased and this by his father s concession in hopes of his good will and fidelity to him and this till he ventured to use his power still farther because his wicked designs were concealed from his father and he made him believe every thing he said He was also formidable to all not so much jpn account of the power and authority he had as for the shrewdness of his vile attempts before hand but he who principally cultivated a friendship with him was Pheroras who received the like marks of his friendship  while Anti pater had cunningly encompassed him about by a company of women whom he placed as guards about him  for Pheroras was greatly enflaved to his wife and to her mother and to her sister  and this notwithstanding the hatred he bare them ior the indignities they had offered to his virgin daughters Yet did he bear them and nothing was to be done without the women who had got this man into their circle and con tinued still to assist each other in all things insomuch that Antipater was entirely addicted to them both by himself and by his mother  for these four women f said all one and the same thing  but the opinions of Pheroras and Antipater were different in some points of no consequence But the king s sister Salome was their antagonist who for a good while had looked about all their affairs and was apprifed that this their friendship was made in order to do Herod some mischief and Â This is now wanting t Pheroras s wife and her mother and sister and Doris Antipater Â nm then Chap II ANTIOJJITIIS OF THE JEWS 1 and was disposed to inform the king of it And since these people knew that their friendship was very disagreeable to Herod as tending to do him a mischief they contrived that their meetings should not be discovered  so they pretended to hate one another and to abuse one another when time ser ved and especially when Herod was present or when any one was there that would tell him  but still their intimacy was firmer than ever when they were private And this was the course they took  but they could not conceal from Salome neither their first contrivance when they set about these their intentions nor when they had made some progress in them  but she searched out every thing  and aggravating the rela tions to her brother declared to him  As well their secret  assemblies and compotations as their counsels taken in a  clandestine manner which if they were not in order to  destroy him they might well enough have been open and  public But to appearance they are at variance and  speak about one another as if they intended one another a  mischief but agree so well together when they are out of  the sight of the multitude  for when they are alone by  themselves they act in concert and profess that they will  never leave off their friendship but will fight against those  from whom they conceal their designs And thus did she search out these things and get a perfect knowledge of them and then told her brother of them who understood also of himself a great deal of what she said but still durst not depend upon it because of the suspicions he had of his sister s calumnies For there was a certain sect of men that were Jews who valued themselves highly upon the exact skill they had in the law of their fathers and made men be lieve they were highly favoured by God by whom this set of women were inveigled These are those that are called the sect of the Pharisees who were in a capacity of greatly opposing kings A cunning sect they were ami soon eleva ted to a pitch of open fighting and doing mischief Accord ingly when all the people of the Jews gave assurance of their good will to Caesar and to the king s government these very men did not swear being above six thousand  and when the king imposed a fine upon them Pheroras s wife paid their fine for them In order to requite which kindness of her s since they were believed to have the foreknowledge of things to come by divine inspiration they foretold how God had de creed that Herod s government should cease and his posterity should be deprived of it but that the kingdom should come lo her and Pheroras and to their childcen These predictions were 9 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XVIL were not concealed from Salome but were told the king  as also how hey I id perverted some persons about the palace itself so the kmg slew such of the Pharisees as were princi pally a  ised and Bagoas the eunuch and one Cams who exceede i all trie 1 of that time in comeliness and one that was his catai nte He slew also all those of his own family who had consente 1 to what the Pharisees foretold and for Bagoas he had been puffed up by them as though he should be na med the father and the benefactor of him who by the pre diction was foretold to be their appointed king  for that this king would have all things in his power and would en ablt Bagoas to marry and to have children of his own body begotten CHAP III 4 Concerning the enmity lctwcei Herod and PJjeroras  bow Herod sent Antipater to desar  and of the death of Pheroras  1 VI HEN Herod had punished those Pharisees who had been convicted of the foregoing crimes he gather ed an assembly together of his friends and accused Pheroras s wife  and ascribing the abuses of the virgins to the impu dence of that woman brought an accusation against her for the dishonour she had brought upon them  That  she had  studiously introduced a quarrel between him and his bro  ther and by her ill temper had brought them into a state  of war both by her words and actions  that the fines which  he had laid had not been paid and the offenders had  escaped punishment by her means  and that nothing which  had of late been done had been done without her  for which Â Â reason Pheroras would do well if he would of his own Â accord and by his own command and not at my intreaty  or as following my opinion put this his wife away as one  that will still be the occasion of war between thee and me  And now Pheroras if thou valuest thy relation to me put  this wife of thine away  for by this means thou wilt con  tinue to be a brother to me and wilt abide in thy love to  me Then said Pheroras although he were pressed hard by the former words that tl as he would not do so un  just a thing as to renounce his brotherly relation to him so Â would he not leave off his affection for his wife  that he  would rather chuse to die than to live and be deprived of Â a wife that was so dear unto him Hereupon Herod put off Chap III 9 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS off his anger against Pheroras on these accounts although he himself thereby underwent a very uneasy punishment How ever he forbade Antipater and his mother to have any con versation with Pheroras and bid them to take care to avoid the assemblies of the women  which they promised to do  but still got together when occasion served and both Pheroras and Antipater had their own merry meetings The report went also that Antipater had criminal conversation with Phe roras s wife  and that they were brought together by Antipater s mother 2 But Antipater had now a suspicion of his father and was afraid that the effects of his hatred to him might increase  so he wrote to his friends at Rome and bid them to send to Herod that he would immediately send Antipater to Caesar  which when it was done Herod sent Antipater thither and sent most noble presents along with him  as also his testament wherein Antipater was appointed to be his successor  and that if Antipa ter should die first his Herod Philip son by the high priest s daughter should succeed And together with Antipater there went to Rome Sylleus the Arabian although ha had done no thing of all that Caesar had enjoined him Antipater also accu sed him of the same crimes of which he had been formerly accu sed by Herod Sylleus was also accused by Aretas that without his consent he had slain many of the chief of the Arabians at Petra and particularly Soemus a man that deserved to be ho noured by all men and that he had slain Fabatus a servant of Caesar s These were the things of which Sylleus was accused and that on the occasion following There was one CorintHus belonging to Herod of the guards of the king s body and one who was greatly trusted by him Sylleus had persuaded this man with the offer of a great sum of money to kill Herod  and he had promised to do it When Fabatus had been acquainted with this for Sylleus had himself told him of it he informed the king of it  who caught Corinthus and put him to the tor ture and thereby got out of him the whole conspiracy He also caught two other Arabians who were discovered by Corinthus  the one the head of a tribe and the other a friend to Sylleus who both were by the king brought to the torture and confess ed that they were come to encourage Corinthus not to fail of doing what he had undertaken to do  and to assist him with their own hands in the murder if need should require their as sistance So Saturniuus upon Herod s discovering the whole to him sent them to Rome 3 At this time Herod commanded Pheroras that since he was so obstinate in his affection for his wife he should retire in  to his own tetrarchy  which he did very willingly and sware Vol III B   many â ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XVII many oaths that he would not come again till he heard that Herod was dead And indeed when upon a sickness of the king s he was desired to come to him before he died that he might intrust him with some of his injunctions he had such a regard to his oath that he would not come to him  yet did not Herod so retain his hatred to Pheroras but remitted of his pur pose not to see him which he before had and that for such great causes as have been already mentioned but as soon as he began to be ill he came to him and this without being sent for  and when he was dead he took care of his funeral and had his body brought to Jerusalem and buried there and appointed a solemn mourning for him This death of Pheroras became the origin of Antipater s misfortunes although he were already sailed for Rome God now being about to punish him for the murder of his brethren I will explain the history of this mat ter very distinctly that it may be for a warning to mankind that they take care of conducting their whole lives by the rules of virtue CHAP IV Pberoras s wife is accused by bis freed men as guilty of poison ing him  and how Herod upon examining of the matter by tor ture found the poison  but so that it had been prepared for him self by his son Antipater  and upon an enquiry by torture he Discovered the dangerous designs of jintipater 1 A S soon as Pheroras was dead and his funeral was over â â two of Pheroras s freed men who were much esteemed by him came to Herod and intreated him not to leave the mur der of his brother without avenging it but to examine into such an unreasonable and unhappy death When he was moved with these words for they seemed to him to be true they said That  Pheroras supped with his wife the day before he fell sick and  that a certain potion was brought him in such a sort of food  as he was not used to eat but that when he had eaten he died Â of it that this potion was brought out of Arabia by a wo  man under pretence indeed as a love potion for that was its  name but in reality to kill Pheroras  for that the Arabian  women are skilful in making such poisons  and the woman to  whom they ascribe this was confessedly a most intimate friend  of one of Sylleus s mistresses  and that both the mother and  the sister of Pheroras s wife had been at the places where she lived and had persuaded her to sell them this potion and had  come Chap IV ANTIQJJITIES OF THE JEWS 11 Â come back and brought it with them the day before that his  supper Hereupon the king was provoked and put the wo men slaves to the torture and some that were free with them  and as the fact did not yet appear because none of them would confess it at length one of them under the utmost agonies said no more but this That  she prayed that God would send the Â like agonies upon Antipater s mother who had been the oc  casion of these miseries to all of them This prayer induced Herod to increase the women s tortures till thereby all was dis covered   Their merry meetings their secret assemblies and Â the disclosing of what he had said to his son alone unto Phe  roras s  women Now what Herod had charged Antipa ter to conceal was the gift of an hundred talents to him not to have any conversation with Pheroras  And what hatred he  bore to his father  and that he complained to his mother how  very long his father lived  and that he was himself almost an  old man insomuch that if the kingdom should come to him it  would not afford him any great pleasure and that there were a  great many of his brothers or brother s children bringing up  that might have hopes of the kingdom as well as himself all  which made his own hopes of it uncertain  for that even  now if he should himself not live Herod had ordained that the  government should be conferred not on his son but rather on  a brother He also had accused the king of great barbarity  and of the slaughter of his sons  and that it was out of the  fear he was under lest he should do the like to him that  made him contrive this his journey to Rome and Pheroras  contrive to go to his own tetrarchy 2 These confessions agreed with what his sister had told him and tended greatly to corroborate her testimony and to free her from the suspicion of her unfaithfulness to him So the king having satisfied himself of the spite which Doris Antipa ter s mother as well as himself bore to him took away from her all her fine ornaments which were worth many talents and then sent her away and entered into friendship with Pheroras s women But he who most of all irritated the king against his son was one Antipater the procurator of Antipater the king s B 2 son â His wife her mother and sister It seems to me by this whole story put together that Pheroras was not himself poisoned as is commonly supposed for Antipater had persuaded him to poison Herod ch v j i which would fall to the ground if he were himself poisoned nor could the poisoning of Pheroras serve any design that appears now going forward it was only the supposal of two of his freed men that this love potion or poison which they knew was brought to Pheroras s wife was made use of for poisoning him  whereas it appears to have been brought for her husband to poi son Herod withal as the future examinations demonstrate  it ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XVII son who when he was tortured among other things said That Antipaterhad prepared a deadly potion and given it to Pheroras with his desire that he would give it to his father during his ab sence and when he was too remote to have the least suspicion cast upon him thereto relating  that Antiphilus one of Antipater s friends brought that potion out of Egypt and that it was sent to Pheroras by Theudion the brother of the mother of Antipa ter the king s son and by that means came to Pheroras s wife her husband having given it her to keep And when the king asked her about it she confessed it and as she was running to fetch it she threw herself down from the house top  yet did she not kill herself because she fell upon her feet by which means when the king had comforted her and had promised her and her domestics pardon upon condition of theirconcealingnothingof the truth from him but had threatened her with the utmost miseries if she proved ungrateful and concealed any thing  so she pro mised and swore that she would speak out every thing and tell after what manner every thing was done  and said what many took to be entirely true that  the potion was brought out of  Egypt by Antiphilus and that his brother who was a pby  sician had procured it and that when Theudion brought it  us she kept it upon Pheroras s committing it to her  and that  it was prepared by Antipater for thee When therefore  Pheroras was fallen sick and thou cafnedst to him and tookedst  care of him and when he saw the kindness thou hadst for him  his mind was overborne thereby So he called me to him and said to me  O woman Antipater hath circumvented me  in this affair of his father and my brother by persuading me  to have a murderous intention to him and procuring a potion  to be subservient thereto  do thou therefore go and fetch my  potion since my brother appears to have still the same vir  tuous disposition towards me which he had formerly and I do f not expect to live long myself and that I may not defile my  forefathers by the murder of a brother and burn it before my  face  that accordingly she immediately brought it and did as  her husband bade her  and that she burnt the greatest part  of the potion  but that a little of it was left that if the king  after Pheroras s death should treat her ill she might poison  herself and thereby get clear of her miseries Upon her say ing thus she brought out the potion and the box in which it was before them all Nay there was another brother of Antiphilus s and his mother also who by the extreme of pain and torture confessed the same things and owned the box to be that which bad been brought out of Egypt The high priest s daughter als6 who was the king s wife was accused to have been con scious Chap V 13 THE ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS scious of all this and had resolved to conceal it for which rea son Herod divorced her and blotted her son out of his teftament wherein he had been mentionecVas one that was to reign after him  and he took the high priesthood away from his father in law Simeon the son of Boethus and appointed Matthias the son of Theophilus who was born at Jerusalem to be high priest in his room 3 While this was doing Bathyllus also Antipater s freed man came from Rome and upon the torture was found to have brought another potion to give it into the hands of Antipater s mother and of Pheroras that if the former potion did not ope rate upon the king this at least might carry him off There came also letters from Herod s friends at Rome by the approbation and at the suggestion of Antipater to accuse Archelaus and Phi lip as if they calumniated their father on account of the slaugh ter of Alexander and Aristobulus and as if they commiserated their deaths and as if because they were sent for home for their father had already recalled them they concluded they were themselves also to be destroyed These letters had been procu red by great rewards by Antipater s friends  but Antipater himself wrote to his father about them and laid the heaviest things to their charge  yet did he entirely excuse them of any guilt and said they were but young men and so imputed their words to their youth But he said that he had himself been very busy in the affair relating to Sylleus and in getting interest among the great men  and on that account had bought splendid ornaments to present them withal which cost him two hundred talents Now one may wonder how it came about that while so many accusations were laid against him in Judea during seven months before this time he was not made acquainted with any of them The causes of which were that the roads were ex actly guarded and that men hated Antipater for there were no body who would run any hazard himself to gain him any advantages CHAP V Antipater s navigation from Rome to his father  and how he was accused by Nicolaus of Damascus and condemned to die by his father and by Â hiintilius Varus who was then president of Sy ria  and how he was then bound till Ceesar should be informed of his cause  iÂ VTOW Herod upon Antipater s writing to him that ha â  ving done all that he was to de and this in the man ner he was to do it he would suddenly come to him concealed his 14 ANTIQJJITIES OF THE iews Book XVIL his anger against him and wrote back to him and bid him not delay his journey lest any harm should befal himself in his ab sence At the same time also he made some little complaint about his mother but promised that he would lay those com plaints aside when he should return He withal expressed his entire affection for him as fearing lest he should have some sus picion of him and defer his journey to him  and lest while he lived at Rome he should lay plots for the kingdom and more over do somewhat against himself This letter Antipater met with in Cilicia  but had received an account of Pherofas s death before at Tarentum This last news affected him deeply  not out of any affection for Pheroras but because he was dead with out having murdered his father which he had promised him to do And when he was at Celenderis in Cilicia he began to de liberate with himself about his sailing home as being much grie ved with the ejection of his mother Now some of his friends advised him that he should tarry a while somewhere in expec tation of farther information But others advised him to sail home without delay  for that if he were once come thither he would soon put an end to all accusations and that nothing af forded any weight to his accusers at present but his absence He was persuaded by these last and sailed on and landed at the ha ven called Sebastus which Herod had built at vast expences in honour of Caesar and called Sebastus And now was Antipater evidently in a miserable condition whjle no body came to him nor saluted him as they did at his going away with good wishes or joyful acclamations  nor was there now any thing to hinder them from entertaining him on the contrary with bitter curses while they supposed he was come to receive his punishment for the murder of his brethren 2 Now Quintilius Varus was at this time at Jerusalem be ing sent to succeed Saturninus as president of Syria and was come as an assessor to Herod who had desired his advice in his present affairs  and as they were sitting together Antipater came upon them without knowing any thing of the matter  so he came into the palace clothed in purple The porters indeed received him in but excluded his friends And now he was in great disorder and presently understood the condition he was in while upon his going to salute his father he was repulsed by him who called him a murderer of his brethren and a plotter of destruction against himself and told him that Varus should be his auditor and his judge the very next day so he found that what misfortune he now heard of was already upon him with the greatness of which he went away in confusion upon which his mother and his wife met him which wife was the daugh ter of Antigonus who was king of the Jews before Herod from whom Chap V ANTIOJJITIES OF THE JEWS 15 whom he learned all circumstances which concerned him and then prepared himself for his trial 3 On the next day Varus and the king sat together in judge ment and both their friends were also called in as also the king s relations with his sister Salome and as many as could discover any thing and such as had been tortured  and besides these some slaves of Antipater s mother who were taken up a Â little before Antipater s coming and brought with them a writ ten letter the sum of which was this that  he should not come  back because all was come to his father s knowledge and  that Caesar was the only refuge he had left to prevent both  his and her delivery into his father s hands Then did An tipater fall down at his father s feet and besought him  not to  prejudge his cause but that he might be first heard by his fa  ther and that his father would keep him still unprejudised So Herod ordered him to be brought into the midst and then  lamented himself about his children from whom he had suf  fered such great misfortunes  and because Antipater fell up  on him in his old age He also reckoned up what mainte  nance and what education he had given them  and what sea  sonable supplies of wealth he had afforded them according to  their own desires none of which favours had hindered them  from contriving against him and from bringing his very life  into danger in order to gain his kingdom after an impiousman  ner by taking away his life before the course of nature their  father s wishes or justice required that that kingdom should  come to them  and that he wondered what hopes could ele  vate Antipatcr to such a pass as to be hardy enough to at  tempt such things  that he had by his testament in writing  declared him his successor in the government and while he  was alive he was in no respect inferior to him either in his  illustrious dignity or in power and authority he having no  less than fifty talents for his yearly income and had received  for his journey to Rome no fewer than thirty talents He  also objected to him the case of his brethren whom he had ac  cused and if they were guilty he had imitated their exam  pie  and if not he had brought him groundless accusations  against his near relations  for that he had been acquainted  with all those things by him and by no body else and had  done what was done by his approbation and whom he now  absolved from all that was criminal by becoming the inheri  tor of the guilt of such their parricide 4 When Herod had thus spoken he fell a weeping and was not able to say any more but at his desire Nicolaus of Damas cus being the king s friend and always conversant with him and 36 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XVII and acquainted with whatsoever he did and with the circum stances of his affairs proceeded to what remained and explained all that concerned the demonstrations and evidences of the facts Upon which Antipater in order to make his legal defence turn td himself to his father and  enlarged upon the many indie a  tions he had given of his good will to him and instanced  in the honours that had been done him which yet had not  been done had he not deserved them by his virtuous con cern about him  for that he had made provision for every  thing that was fit to be foreseen beforehand as to giving him  his wisest advice  and whenever there was occasion for the la bour of his own hands he had not grudged any such pains for him And that it was almost impossible that he who had delivered his father from so many treacherous contrivances  laid against him should be himself in a plot against him and  so lose all the reputation he had gained for his virtue by his  wickedness which succeeded it and this while he had nothing  to prohibit him who had already appointed his successor to en  joy the royal honour with his father also at present and that  therewasno likelihood that a person who had the one half of that  authority without any danger and with a good character should  hunt after the whole with infamy and danger and this when  it was doubtful whether he could obtain it or not and when  he sawthe sadexample of his brethren before him and was both  the informer and the accuser against them at a time when they  might not otherwise have been discovered  nay was the au  thor of the punishment inflicted upon them when it appeared Â evidently that they were guilty of a wicked attempt against  their father  and that even the contentions there were in the  king s family were indications that he had ever managed affairs  out of the srncerest affection to his father And as to what he  had done at Rome Caesar was a witness thereto  who yet was  no more to be imposed upon than God himself of whose opi  nions his letters sent hither are sufficient evidence and that it  was not reasonable to prefer the calumnies of such as proposed  to raise disturbances before those letters  the greatest part of  which calumnies had been raised during his absence which  gave scope to his enemies to forge them which they had not  been able to do if he had been there Moreover he shewed the weakness of the evidence obtained by torture which was com monly false because the distress men are in under such tortures naturally obliges them to say many things in order to please those that govern them He also offered himself to the torture 5 Hereupon there was a change observed in the assembly while they greatly pitied Antipater who by weeping and put ting Chap V ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 17 ting on a countenance suitable to his sad case made them cotn tniserate the same  insomuch that his very enemies were mc ved to compassion  and it appeared plainly that Herod himself was affected in his own mind although he was not willing it should be taken notice of Then did Nicolaus begin to prose cute what the king had begun and that with great bitterness  and summed up all the evidence which arose from the tortures or from the testimonies  He principally and largely cried up  the king s virtues which he had exhibited in the maintenance  and education of his sons  while he never could gain any ad  vantage thereby but still fell from one misfortune to another  Although he owned that he was not so much surprised with  that thoughtless behaviour of his former sons who were but  young and were besides corrupted by wicked counsellors  who were the occasion of their wiping out of their minds the  righteous dictates of nature and this out of a desire of coming  to the government sooner than they ought to do  yet that he  could not but justly stand amazed at the horrid wickedness of  Antipater who although he had not only had great benefits  bestowed on him by his father enough to tame his reason yet  could not be more tamed than the most envenomed serpents   whereas even those creatures admit of some mitigation and  will not bite their benefactors while Antipater hath not let  the misfortunes of his brethren be any hindrance to him but  he hath gone on to imitate their barbarity notwithstanding  Yet wast thou O Antipater  as thou hast thyself confessed  the informer as to what wicked actions they had done and the  searcher out of the evidence against them and the author of  the punishment they underwent upon their detection Nor  do we say this as accusing thee for being so zealous in thy an  ger against them but are astonished at thy endeavours to imi  tate their profligate behaviour  and we discover thereby that  thou didst not act thus for the safety of thy father but for the  destructioa of thy brethren that by such outside hatred of their  impiety thou mightest be believed a lover of thy father and  mightest thereby get thee power enough to do mischief with  the greatest impunity  which design thy actions indeed demon  strate It is true thou tookest thy brethren off because thou  didst convict them of their wicked designs  but thou didst not yield up to justice those who were their partners  and there  by didst make it evident to all men that thou madest a cove  nant with them against thy father when thou chosest to be  the accuser of thy brethren as desirous to gain to thyself alone  this advantage of laying plots to kill thy father and so to en   c  1Â ANTIQJJITIES OF THE JEWS Book XVII  joy double pleasure which is truly worthy of thy evil disposi  tion which thou hast openly shewed against thy brethren  on 1 which account thou didst rejoice as having done a most famous  exploit nor was that behaviour unworthy of thee But if  thy intention were otherwise thou art worse than they  while  thou didst contrive to hide thy treachery against thy father  thou didst hate themr not as plotters against thy father for in  that case thou hadst not thyself fallen upon the like crime  but as successors of his dominions and more worthy of that  succession than thyself Thou wouldst kill thy father after  thy brethren lest thy lies raised against them might be detect Â ed  and lest thou shouldst suffer what punishment thou hadst  deserved thou hadst a mind to exact that punishment of thy  unhappy father and didst devise such a sort of uncommon par  ricide as the world never yet saw For thou who art his son  did not only lay a treacherous design against thy father and c didst it while he loved thee and had been thy benefactor had M made thee in reality his partner in the kingdom and had open  ly declared thee his successor while thou wast not forbidden  to taste the sweetness of authority already and hadst the firm  hope of what was future by thy father s determination and  the security of a written testament But for certain thou  didst not measure these things according to thy father s va  rious disposition but according to thy own thoughts and incli  nations  and wast desirous to take the part that remained  away from thy too indulgent father and soughtest to destroy Â him with thy deeds whom thou in words pretendedst to pre M serve Nor wast thou content to be wicked thyself but thou  filledst thy mother s head with thy devices and raised distur  bances among thy brethren and hadst the boldness to call thy  father a wild beast while thou hadst thyself a mind more cruel  than any serpent whence thou sendest out that poison among thy  nearest kindred and greatest benefactors and invitedst them to  assist thee and guard thee and didst hedge thyself in on all  sides by the artifices of both men and women against an old  man  as tho that mind of thine was not sufficient of itself to  support so great an hatred as thou baredst to him And here  thou appearest after the tortures of free men of domestics of  men and women which have been examined on thy account  and after the informations of thy fellow conspirators as ma Â king haste to contradict the truth  and hast thought on ways  not only how to take thy father out of the world but to dis  annal that written law which is against thee and the virtue  of Varus and the nature of justice  nay such is that impu  dence of thine on which thou confidest that thou desirest to be  put Chap V ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 19 4 put to the torture thyself while thou alledgest that the tor  tures of those already examined thereby have made them tell  lies  that those that have been the deliverers of thy father may Â not be allowed to have spoken the truth  but that thy tortures  may be esteemed the discoverers of truth Wilt not thou O Va  rus  deliver the king from the injuries of his kindred  Wilt not  thou destroy this wicked wild beast which hath pretended kind  ness to his father in order to destroy his brethren  while yet he  is himself alone ready to carry off the kingdom immediately  and appears to be the most bloody butcher to him of them all   For thou art sensible that parricide is a general injury both to  nature and to common life  and that the intention of parricide  is not inferior to its preparation  and Tie who does not punish  it is injurious to nature itself 6 Nicolaus added farther what belonged to Antipater s mo ther and whatsoever she had prattled like a woman  as also a hout the predictions and the sacrifices relating to the king  and whatsoever Antipater had done lasciviously in his cups and his amours among Pheroras s women  the examination upon tor ture  and whatsoever concerned the testimonies of the witnes ses which were many and of various kinds  some prepared beforehand and others were sudden answers which farther de clared and confirmed the foregoing evidence For those men who were not acquainted with Antipater s practices but had concealed them out of fear when they saw that he was exposed to the accusations of the former witnesses and that his great good fortune which had supported him hitherto had now evi dently betrayed him into the hands of his enemies who were now insatiable in their hatred to him told all they knew of him And his ruin was now hastened not so much by the enmity of those that were his accusers as by his gross and impudent and wicked contrivances and by his ill will to his father and his brethren  while he had filled their house with disturbance and caused them to murder one another  and was neither fair in his hatred nor kind in his friendship but just so far as served his own turn Now there were a great number who for a long time beforehand had seen all this and especially such as were naturally disposed to judge of matters by the rules of vir tue because they were used to determine about affairs without passion but had been restrained from making any open complaints before  these upon the leave now given them produced all that they knew before the public The demonstrations also of these wicked facts could no way be disproved  because the ma ny witnesses there were did neither speak out of favour to He rod nor were they obliged to keep what they had to say silent C 2  out 20 x ANTIQJIITIES OF THE JEWS Book XVII out of suspicion of any danger they were in  but they spake what they knew because they thought such actions very wick ed and that Antipater deserved the greatest punishment and indeed not so much for Herod s safety as on account of the man s own wickedness Many things were also said that those by a great number of persons who were no way obliged to say them insomuch that Antipater who used generally to be very shrewd in his lies and impudence was not able to say one word to the contrary When Nicolaus had left off speaking and had produced the evidence Varus bid Antipater to betake himself to tlie making his defence if he had prepared any thing whereby it might appear that he was not guilty of the crimes he was accused of for that as he was himself desirous so did he know that his father was in like manner desirous also to have him found entirely innocent But Antipater fell down on his face and appealed to God and to all men for testimonials of his innocency desiring that God would declare by some evident signals that he had not laid any plot against his father This being the usual method of all men destitute of virtue that when they set about any wicked undertakings they fall to work according to their own inclinations as if they believed that God was unconcerred in human affairs  but when once they are found out and are in danger of undergoing the punishment due to their crimes they endeavour to overthrow all the evidence against them by appealing to God  which was the very thing which Antipater now did  for whereas he had done every thing as if there were no God in the world when he was on all sides dis tressed by justice and when he had no other advantage to ex pect from any legal proofs by which he might disprove the ac cusations laid against him be impudently abused the majesty of God and ascribed it to his power that he had been preserved hitherto  and produced before them all what difficulties he had ever undergone in his bold acting for his father s preservation 7 So when Varus upon Asking Antipater what he had to say for himself found that he had nothing to say besides his ap peal to God and saw that there was no end of that he bid them bring the potion before the court that he might see what vir tue still remained in it and when it was brought and one that was condemned to die had drunk it by Varus s command he died presently Then Varus got up and departed out of the court and went away the day following to Antioch where his u iual residence was because that was the palace of the Syrians  u on which Herod laid his son in bonds But what were Va  r as s discourses to Herod was not known to the generality and upon what ivords it was that he went away  though it was also Chap V THE ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS  21 also generally supposed that whatsoever Herod did afterward about his son was done with his approbation But when He rod had bound his son he sent letters to Rome to Caesar about him and such messengers withal as should by word of mouth inform Caesar of Antipater s wickedness Now at this very time there was seized a letter of Antiphilus written to Anti pater out of Egypt for he lived there  and when it was ppened by the king it was fsund to contain what follows  I Â have sent thee Acme s letter and hazarded my own life  for fÂ thou knowest that I am in danger from two families if I be  discovered I wish thee good success in thy affair These were the contents of this letter but the king made inquiry about the other letter also for it did not appear and Antiplnlusjs slave who brought that letter which had been read denied that he had received the other But while the king was in doubt about it one of Herod s friends seeing a seam upon the inner coat of the slave and a doubling of the cloth for he had two coats on he guessed that the letter might be within that doub ling  which accordingly proved to be true So they took out the letter and its contents were these  Acme to Antipater  I have written such a letter to thy father as thou desirest me f I have also taken a copy and sent it as if it came from Sa  lome to my lady Livia  which when thou readest I know  that Herod will punish Salome as plotting against him Now this pretended letter of Salome s to her lady was composed by Antipater in the name of Salome as to its real meaning but in the words of Acme The letter was this   Acme to king He  rod I have done my endeavour that nothing that is done  against thee should be concealed from thee So upon my find  ing a letter of Salome written to my lady against thee I have  written out a copy and sent it to thee  with hazard to myself f but for thy advantage The reason why she wrote it was this  that she had a mind to be married to SyIleus Do thou there  fore tear this letter in pieces that I may not come into dan  ger of my life Now Acme had written to Antipatsr him self and informed him that in compliance with his command she had both herself written to Herod as if Salome had laid a sudden plot entirely against him and had herself sent a copy of an epistle as coming from Salome to her lady Now Acme was a Jew by birth and a servant to Julia Caasar s wife  and did this out of her friendship for Antipater as having been cor rupted by him with a large present of money to assist in his pernicious designs against his father and his aunt 8 Hereupon Herod was so amazed at the prodigious wicked ness of Antipater that he was ready to have ordered him to be slain 22 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XVII slain immediately as a turbulent person in the most important concerns and as one that had laid a plot not only against him self but against his sister also and even corrupted Caesar s own domestics Salome also provoked him to it beating her breast and bidding him kill her if he could produce any credible testi mony that she had acted in that manner Herod also sent for his son and asked him about this matter and bid him contradict it if he could and not suppress any thing he had to say for him self  and when he had not one word to say he asked him since he was every way caught in his villainy that he would make no farther delay but discover his associates in these his wicked designs So he laid all upon Antiphilus but discovered no body else Hereupon Herod was in such great grief that he was ready to send his son to Rome to Caesar there to give an ac count of these his wicked contrivances But he soon became afraid lest he might there by the assistance of his friends es cape the danger he was in  so he kept him bound as before and sent more ambassadors and letters to Rome to accuse his son and an account of what assistance Acme had given him in his wicked designs with copies of the epistles before mentioned CHAP VL Concerning the disease that Herod fell into and the sedition which the Jews raised thereupon  with the punishment of the seditious Â i TVTOW Herod s ambassadors made haste to Rome  but   went as instructed beforehand what answers they were to make to the questions put to them They also carried the epistles with them But Herod now fell into a distemper and made his will and bequeathed his kingdom to Antipas his youngest son  and this out of that hatred to Archelaus and Phi lip which the calumnies of Antipater had raised against them He also bequeathed a thousand talents to Caesar and five hun dred to Julia Caesar s wife to Caesar s children and friends and freed men He also distributed among his sons and their sons his money his revenues and his lands He also made Salome his sister very rich because she had continued faithful to him in all his circumstances and was never so rash as to do him any harm  and as he despaired of recovering for he was about the seventieth year of his age he grew fierce and indulged the bit terest anger upon all occasions  the cause whereof was this that he thought himself despised and that the nation was pleased with his misfortunes besides which he resented a sedition which some of Chap VI ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 23 of the lower sort of men excited against him the occasion of which was as follows 2 There was one Judas the son of Saripheus and Matthias the son of Margalothus two of the most eloquent men among the Jews and the most celebrated interpreters of the Jewish laws and men well beloved by the people because of their edu cation of their youth  for all those that were studious of virtue frequented their lectures every day These men when they found that the king s distemper was incurable excited the young men that they would pull down all those works which the king had erected contrary to the law of their fathers and thereby ob tain the rewards which the law will confer on them for such actions of piety  for that it was truly on account of Herod s rashness in making such things as the law had forbidden that his other misfortunes and this distemper also which was so un usual among mankind and with which he was now afflicted came upon him  for Herod had caused such things to be made which were contrary to the law of which he was accused by Judas and Matthias  for the king had erected over the great gate of the temple a large golden eagle of great value and had dedicated it to the temple Now the law forbids those that propose to live according to it to erect images  or representations of any living creature So these wise men persuaded their scholars to pull down the golden eagle  alledging that  although they should  incur any danger which might bring them to their deaths  the virtue of the action now proposed to them would appear  much more advantageous to them than the pleasures of life u since they would die for the preservation and observation of  the law of their fathers  since they would also acquire an ever w lasting fame and commendation  since they would be both  commended by the present generation and leave an example  of life that would never be forgotten to posterity  since that  common calamity of dying cannot be avoided by our living so  as to escape any such dangers  that therefore it is a right thing  for those who are in love with a virtuous conduct to wait for  that fatal hour by such a behaviour as may carry them out of  the world with praise and honour  and that this will alleviate  death to a great degree thus to come at it by the perform  ance of brave actions which bring us into danger of it and  at the same time to leave that reputation behind them to their  children and to all their relations whether they be men or  women which will be of great advantage to them afterward j And with such discourses as this did these men excite the young  That the making of images without an intention to worship them was not unlawful to the Jews see the note on Antiq B V Ul ch vii  5 Â 4 AKTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XVlf young men to this action  and a report being come to them that the king was dead this was an addition to the wise men s per suasions  so in the very middle of the day they got upon the place they pulled down the eagle and cut it into pieces with axes while a great number of the people were iu the temple And now the king s captain upon hearing what the undertaking was and supposing it was a thing of a higher nature than it proved to be came up thither having a great band of soldiers with him such as was sufficient to put a stop to the multitude of those who pulled down what was dedicated to God  so he fell upon them unexpectedly and as they were upon this bold attempt in a foolish presumption rather than a cautious circumspection as is usual with the multitude and while they were in disorder and incautious of what was for their advantage so he caught no fewer than forty of the young men who had the courage to stay behind when the rest ran away together with the authors of this bold attempt Judas and Matthias who thought it an ignomi nious thing to retire upon his approach and led them to the king And when they were come to the king and he had asked them if they had been so bold as to pull down what he had dedi cated to God   Yes said they what was contrived we con  trived and what had been performed we performed it and  that with such a virtuous courage as becomes men  for we  have given our assistance to those things which were dedicated  to the majesty of God and we have provided for what we  have learned by hearing the law  and it ought not to be won  dered at if we esteem those laws which Moses had suggested Â to him and were taught him by God and which he wrote  and left behind him more worthy of observation than thy Â commands Accordingly we will undergo death and all sorts  of punishment which thou canst inflict upon us with pleasure  since we are conscious to ourselves that we shall die not for Â any unrighteous actions but for our love to religion And thus they all said and their courage was still equal to their pro fession and equal to that with which they readily set about this undertaking And when the king had ordered them to be bound he sent them to Jericho and called together the principal men among the Jews  and when they were come he made them as semble in the theatre and because he could not himself stand he lay upon a couch and  enumerated the many labours that he  had long endured on their account and his building of the Â temple and what a vast charge that was to him  while the  Asamoneans during the hundred and twenty five years of their  orovernment had not been able to perform any so great a work  for the honour of God as that was  that he had also adorned Â Â it Chap VI ASTIQJJIT1ES OF THE JEWS 25  it with very valuable donations  on which account he hoped  that he had left himself a memorial and procured himself a  reputation after his death He then cried out that these men  had not abstained from affronting him even in his life time  but that in the very day time and in the sight of the multi  tude they had abused him to that degree as to fall upon what  he had dedicated and in that way of abuse had pulled it down  to the ground They pretended indeed that they did it to  affront him  but if any one considering the thing truly they  will find that they were guilty of sacrilege against God  therein 4 But the people on account of Herod s barbarous temper and for fear he should be so cruel as to inflict punishment on them said  What was done was done without their approba  tion and that it seemed to them that the actors might well be  punished for what they had done But as for Herod he dealt more mildly with others of the assembly  but he deprived Matthias of the high priesthood as in part an occasion of this action and made Joazar who was Matthias s wife s brother high priest in his stead Now it happened that during the time of the high priesthood of this Matthias there was another per son made high priest for a single day that very day which the Jews observed as a fast The occasion was this  This Matthias the high priest on the night before that day when the fast was to be celebrated seemed in a dream  to have conversation with his wife  and because he could not officiate himself on that account Joseph the son of Ellemus his kinsman assisted him in that sacred office But Herod deprived this Matthias of the high priesthood and burnt the other Matthias who had raised the sedition with his companions alive And that very night tbere was an eclipse of the moon f VOL III D 5 But  This fact that one Joseph was made high priest for a single day on occa sion of the action here specified that befel Matthias the real high priest in his sleep the night before the great day of expiation is attested tobo h in the Mish na and Talmud as Dr Hudson here informs us And indeed from this fact thus fully attested we may confute that pretended rule in the Talmud here men tioned and endeavoured to be excused by Reland that the high priest was not suffered to ileep the night before that great day of expiation which watching would surely rather unfit him for the many important duties he was to perform on that solemn day than dispose him duly to perform them Nor do such Tal tnudical rules when unsupported by better evidence much less when contradict ed thereby seem to me of weight enough to deserve that so great a man as Re land should spend his time in endeavours at their vindication t This eclipse of the moon which is iheonly eclipse of either of the luminarie mentioned by our Josephus in any of his writings isof the greatest consequence for the determination of the time for the death of Herod and Antipater and for the birth and entire chronology of Jesus Christ It happened March I3th in the 26 Book XVII ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 5 But now Herod s distemper greatly Increased upon him after a severe manner and this by God s judgement upon him for his sins for a fire glowed in him slowly which did not so much appear to the touch outwardly as it augmented his pains in wardly  for it brought upon him a vehement appetite to eating which he could not avoid to supply with one sort of food or other His entrails were also exulcerated and the chief vio lence of his pain lay on his colon  an aqueous and transparent liquor also had settled itself about his feet and a like matter af flicted him at the bottom of his belly Nay farther his privy member was putriiied and produced worms  and when he sat upright he had a difficulty of breathing which was very loath some on account of the stench of his breath and the quickness of its returns he had also convulsions in all parts of his body which increased his strength to an unsufierable degree It was said by those who pretended to divine and who were endued with wisdom to foretel such things that God inflicted this pu nishment on the king on account of his great impiety  yet was he still in hopes of recovering though his afflictions seemed greater than any one could bear He also sent for physicians and did not refuse to follow what they prescribed for his assist ance and went beyond the river Jordan and bathed himself in the warm baths that were at Callirrhoe which besides their other general virtues were also fit to drink  which water runs into the lake called Asphaltitis And when the physicians once thought fit to have him bathed in a vessel full of oil it was sup posed that he was just dying  but upon the lamentable cries of his domestics he revived  and having no longer the least hopes of recovering he gave order that every soldier should be paid fifty drachmae  and he also gave a great deal to their command ers and to his friends and came again to Jericho where he grew so choleric that it brought him to do all things like a madman  and though he were near his death he contrived the following wicked designs He commanded that all the principal men of the entire Jewish nation wheresoever they lived should be call ed to him Accordingly they were a great number that came because the whole nation was called and all men heard of this call and death was the penalty of such as should despise the epistles that were sent to call them And now the king was in a wild rage against them all the innocent as well as those that had afforded ground for accusations and when they were come he year of the Julian period 4710 and the 4th year before the Christian aera See its calculation by the rules of astronomy at the end of the Astronological Lec rares edit Lat p 451 451 Chap VI ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS  Z1 he ordered them to be all shut up in the hippodrome  and sent for his sister Salome and her husband Alexis and spake thus to them   I shall die in a little time so great are my pains  which  death ought to be chearfully borne and to be welcomed by  all men but what principally troubles me is this that I shall  die without being lamented and without such mourning as Â men usually expect at a king s death For that he was not  unacquainted with the temper of the Jews that his death  would be a thing very desirable and exceedingly acceptable  to them  because during his lifetime they were ready to re  volt from him and to abuse the donations he had dedicated to  God  that it therefore was their business to resolve to afford  him some alleviation of his great sorrows on this occasion   for that if they do not refuse him their consent in what he desires he shall have a great mourning at his funeral and  such as never any king had before him  for then the whole  nation would mourn from their very soul which otherwise  would be done in sport and mockery only He desired there  fore that as soon as they see he hath given up the ghost they  shall place soldiers round the hippodrome while they do not  know that he is dead and that they shall not declare his  death to the multitude till this is done but that they shall  give orders to have those that are in custody shot with their â darts and that this slaughter of them all will cause that he  shall not miss to rejoice on a double account that as he  is dying they will make him secure that his will shall be exe  cuted in what he charges them to do  and that he shall have  the honour of a memorable mourning at his funeral So he  deplored his condition with tears in his eyes and obtested  them by the kindness due from them as of his kindred and  by the faith they otved to God and begged of them that they would not hinder him of this honourable mourning tit his fu  neral So they promised him not to transgress his com mands 6 Now any one may easily discover the temper of this man s mind which not only took pleasure in doing what he had done formerly against his relations out of the love of life but by those commands of his which savoured of no humanity  since he took care when he was departing out of this life that the whole nation should be put into mourning and indeed made desolate of their dearest kindred when he gave order that one out of every family should be slain although they had done nothing rfiat was unjust or that was against him nor were they accused of any other crimes while it is usual for those who have any D 2

VII Herod has thoughts of killing himself with his own hand  and a little afterwards he orders Antipater to be slain Â 1 A S he was giving these commands to his relations there  came letters from his ambassadors who had been sent to Rome unto Caesar which when they were read their pur port was this That  Acme was slain by Caesar out of his in  dignation at what hand she had in Antipater s wicked prac  tices and that as to Antipater himself Coesar left it to He  rod to act as became a father and a king and either to banish  him or take away his life which he pleased When He rod heard this he was somewhat better out of the pleasure he had from the contents of the letters and was elevated at the death of Acme and at the power that was given him over his son  but as his pains were become very great he was now ready to faint for want of somewhat to eat so he called for an apple and a knife  for it was his custom formerly to pare the apple himself and soon afterwards to cut it and eat it When he had got the knife he looked about and had a mind to stab himself with it and he had done it had not his first cousin Achiabus prevented him and held his hand and cried out loud ly Whereupon a woful lamentation echoed through the pa lace and a great tumult was made as if the king were dead Upon which Antipater who verily believed his father was de ceased grew bold in his discourse as hoping to be immediately and entirely released from his bonds and to take the kingdom into his hands without any more ado so he discoursed with the jailor about letting him go and in that case promised him great things both now and hereafter as if that were the only thing now in question But the jailor did not only refuse to do what Antipater would have him but informed the king of his intentions and how many solicitations he had had from him of that nature Hereupon Herod who had formerly no affection nor good will towards his son to restrain him when he heard what the jailor said he cried out and beat his head although he was at death s door and raised himself upon his elbow and sent for some of his guards and commanded them to kill Anti pater without any farther delay and to do it presently and to bury him in an ignoble manner at Hyrcania CHAP Chap VIII ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 2Â  CHAP VIII Concerning Herod s death and testament and burial  I A ND now Herod altered his testament upon the altera  tion of his mind 5 for he appointed Antipas to whom he had before left the kingdom to be tetrarch of Galilee and Perea and granted the kingdom to Archelaus He also gave Gaulonitis and Trachonitis and Paneas to Philip who was his son but own brother  to Archelaus by the name of tetrarchy  and bequeathed Jamnia and Ashdod and Phasaelis to Salome his sister with five hundred thousand drachmae of silver that was coined He also made provision for all the rest of his kind red by giving them sums of money and annual revenues and so left them all in a wealthy condition He bequeathed also to Cae sar ten millions of drachmae of coined money besides both ves sels of gold and silver and garments exceeding costly to Julia Caesar s wife  and to certain others five millions When he had done these things he died the fifth day after he had caused Antipater to be slain having reigned since he had procured An tigonus f to be slain thirty four years  but since he had been declared king by the Romans thirty seven A man he was of great barbarity towards all men equally and a slave to his pas sion  but above the consideration of what was right yet was he favoured by fortune as much as any man ever was for from a private man he became a king  and though he were encom passed with ten thousand dangers he got clear of them all and continued his life till a very old age But then as to the affairs of his family and children in which indeed according to his own opinion he was also very fortunate because he was able to conquer his enemies yet in my opinion he was herein very unfortunate 2 But then Salome and Alaxis before the king s death was made known dismissed those that were shut up in the hippo drome  When it is here said that Philip the tetrarch and Archelaus the king or fthnarch were Ktfm yntui or genuine brothers if those words mean own brothers or born ot the same father and mother there must be here some mis take because they had indeed the same father Herod but different mothers the former Cleopatra and Archelaus Malthace They were indeed brought sp altogether at Some like own brothers and Philip was Archelaus s deputy when he went to

ANTIQJJITIES OF THE JEWS Book XVII drome and told them that the king ordered them to go away to their own lands and take care of their own affairs which was ssteemed by the nation a great benefit And now the king s death was made public when Salome and Alexis gathered the soldiery together in the amphitheatre at Jericho  and the first thing they did was they read Herod s letter written to the sol diery thanking them for their fidelity and good will to him and exhorting them to afford his son Archelaus whom he had ap pointed for their king like fidelity and good will After which Ptolemy who had the king s seal entrusted to him read the king s testament which was to be of force no otherwife than as it should stand when Caesar had inspected it fo there was pre sently an acclamation made to Archelaus as king and the sol diers came by bands and their commanders with them and pro mised the same good will to him and readiness to serve him which they had exhibited to Herod  and they prayed God to be assistant to him 3 After this was over they prepared for his funeral it being Archelaus s care that the procession to his father s sepulchre should be very sumptuous Accordingly he brought out all his ornaments to adorn the pomp of the funeral The body was carried upon a golden bier embroidered with very precious stones of great variety and it was covered over with purple as well as the body itself he had a diadem upon his head and above it a crown of gold  he also had a sceptre in his right hand About the bier were his sons and his numerous relations  next to these was the soldiery distinguished according to their seve ral countries and denominations  and they were put into the following order  First of all went his guards  then the band of Thracians  and after them the Germans and next the band of Galatians every one in their habuiliments of war  and behind these marched the whole army in the same manner as they used to go out to war and as they used to be put in array by their muster masters and centurions  thefe were followed by five hun dred of his domestics carrying spices So they went eight fur longs to Herodium  for there by his own command he was to he buried And thus did Herod end his life 4 Now Archelaus paid him so much respect as to continue his mourning till the seventh day  for so many days are ap pointed for it by the law of our fathers And when he had given a treat to the multitude and left off his mourning he went  At eiglit stadia or furlongs a day as here Herod s funeral conducted to Herodium which lay at the distance from Jericho where he died of 100 stadia or furlongs Of the War B I ch xxxiii J p must have taken up no less than twenty five days  Chap VIII ANTIQJJITIES OF THE JEWS 51 went up into the temple he had also acclamations and praises given him which way foever he went every one striving with the rest who should appear to use the loudest acclamations So he ascended an high elevation made for him and took his seat in a throne made of gold and spake kindly to the multitude and declared  with what joy he received their acclamations and  the marks of the good will they shewed to him  and returned  them thanks that they did not remember the injuries his fa  ther had done them to his disadvantage  and promised them  he would endeavour not to be behindhand with them in re  warding their alacrity in his service after a suitable manner   but that he should abstain at present from the name of king  and that he should have the honour of that dignity if Caesar  should confirm and settle that testament which his father had  made  and that it was on this account that when the army  would have put the diadem on him at Jericho he would not Â accept of that honour which is usually so much desired be  cause it was not yet evident that he who was to be principally  concerned in bestowing it would give it him  although by  his acceptance of the government he should not want the abi  lity of rewarding their kindness to him  and that it should be  his endeavour as to all things wherein they were concerned  to prove in every respect better than his father Where upon the multitude as it is usual with them supposed that the first days of those that enter upon such governments declare the intentions of those that accept them  and so by how much Ar chelaus spake the more gently and civilly to them by so much did they more highly commend him and made application to him for the grant of what they desired Some made a clamour that he would ease them of some of their annual payments  but others desired him to release those that were put into prison by Herod who were many and had been put there at several times others of them required that he would take away those taxes which had been severely laid upon what was publicly sold and bought So Archelaus contradicted them in nothing since he pretended to do all things so as to get the good will of the multitude to him as looking upon that good will to be a grctt Step towards his preservation of the government Hereupon he went and offered sacrifice to God and then betook hiniielf to Â east with his friends C H A P 32 ANTIQJJITIES OF THE JEWS Book XVII CHAP IX How the people raised a sedition against jArcielaus and l ow Jje sailed to Home J I AT this time also it was that some of the Jews got to  gather out of a desire of innovation They lamented Matthias and those that were slain with him by Herod who had not any respect paid them by a funeral mourning out of the fear men were in of that man  they were those who had been con demned for pulling down the golden eagle The people made a great clamour and lamentation hereupon and cast but some re proaches against the king also as if that tended to alleviate the miseries of the deceased The people assembled together and desired of Archelaus that iu way of revenge on their account he would inflict punishment on those who had been honoured by Herod  and that in the first and principal place he would de prive that high priest whom Herod had made and would choose one more agreeable to the law and of greater purity to officiate as high priest This was granted by Archelaus although he was mightily offended at their importunity because he proposed to himself to go to Rome immediately to look after Caesar s determination about him However he sent the general of his forces to use persuasions and to tell them that the death which was inflicted on their friends was according to the law  and to represent to them that their petitions about these things were carried to a great height of injury to him  that the time was not now proper for such petitions but required their unanimity until such time as he should be established in the government by the consent of Caesar antf should then be come back to them  for that he would then consult with them in common concern ing the purport of their petitions but that they ought at pre sent to be quiet lest they should seem seditious persons 2 So when the king had suggested these things and instruct ed his general in what he was to say he sent him away to the people  but they made a clamour and would not give him leave to speak and put him in danger of his life and as many more as were desirous to venture upon saying openly any thing which might reduce them to a sober mind and prevent their going on in their present courses  because they had more concern to have all their own wills performed than to yield obedience to their governors  thinking it to be a thing insufferable that while Hercd was alive they should lose those that were the most dear to them and that when he was dead they could not get the ac tors to be punished So they went on with their designs after a violent Chap IX ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS S3 violent manner and thought all to be lawful and right which tended to please them and being unskilful in foreseeing what dangers they incurred  and when they had suspicion of such a thing yet did the present pleasure they took in the punilhment of those they deemed their enemies overweigh all such consi derations  and although Archelaus sent many to speak to them yet they treated them not as meflengers sent by him but as persons that came of their own accord to mitigate their anger and would not let one of them speak The sedition also was made by such as were in a great passion  and it was evident that they were proceeding farther in seditious practices by the multitude s running so fast upon them 3 Now upon the approach of that feast of unleavened bread which the law of their fathers had appointed for the Jews at this time which feast is called the Passover  and is a memorial of their deliverance out of Egypt when they offer sacrifices with great alacrity  and when they are required to slay more sacrifi ces in number than at any other festival and when an innu merable multitude came thither out of the country nay from beyond its limits also in order to worfliip God  the seditious lamented Judas and Matthias those teachers of the laws and kept together in the temple and had plenty of food because these seditious persons were not ashamed to beg it And as Archelaus was afraid lest some terrible thing should spring up by means of these men s madness he sent a regiment of armed men and with them a captain of a thousand to suppress the vio lent efforts of the seditious before the whole multitude should be infected with the like madness  and gave them this charge that if they found any much more openly seditious than others and more busy in tumultuous practices they should bring them to him But those that were seditious on account of those teachers of the law irritated the people by the noise and cla mours they used to encourage the people in their designs so they made an assault upon the soldiers and came up to them and stoned the greatest part of them although some of them ran away wounded and their captain among them and when they had thus done they returned to the sacrifices which were already in their hands Now Archelaus thought there was no way to preserve the entire government but by cutting off those who made this attempt upon it so he sent out the whole army upon â them and sent the horsemen to prevent those that had their tents without the temple from assisting those that were within VOL III  â E  the     i â  â   This pissover when the sedition here mentioned was moved against Ar helaus was not one but thirteen months after the eclipse of the moon already mentioned  4 AtfTIQUITlES OF THE JEWS Book XVIf the temple and to kill such as run away from the footmen when they thought themselves out of danger which horsemen slew three thousand men while the rest went to the neighbour ing mountains Then did Archelaus order proclamation to be made to them all that they should retire to their own homes  so they went away and left the festival out of fear of some what worse which would follow although they had been so bold by reason of their want of instruction So Archelaus went down to the sea with his mother and took with him Nicolaus and Ptolemy and many others of his friends and left Philip his brother as governor of all things belonging both to his own fa mily and to the public There went out also with him Saldme Herod s sister who took with her her children and many of her kindred were with her  which kindred of hers went as they pretended to assist Archelaus in gaining the kingdom but in reality to oppose him and chiefly to make loud complaints of what he had done in the temple But Sabinus Caesar s steward for Syrian affairs as he was making haste into Judea to pre serve Herod s efle s met with Archelaus at Caesarea  but Va rus president of Syria came at that time and restrained him from meddling witji them for he was there as sent for by Av chelaus by the means of Ptolemy And Sabinus out of re gard to Varus did neither seize upon any of the castles that were among the Jews nor did he seal up the treasures in them but permitted Archelaus to have them until Caesar should de clare his resolution about them  so that upon this his promise he tarried still at Caesarea But after Archelaus was sailed for Rome and Varus was removed to Antioch Sabinus went to Jerusalem and seized on the king s palace He also sent for the keepers of the garrisons and for all those that had the charge of Herod s effects and declared publicly that he should require them to give an account of what they had and he disposed of the castles jn the manner he pleased  but those who kept them did not neglect what Archelaus had given them in command but continued to keep all things in the manner they had been enjoined them  and their pretence was that they kept them all for Caesar  4 At the same time also did Antipas another of Herod s sons sail to Rome in order to gain the government being buoyed up by Salome with promises that he should take that govern ment  and that he was a much honester and fitter man than Ar chelaus for that authority  since Herod had in his former tesr tament deemed him the worthiest to be made king which ought to be esteemed more valid than his latter testament Antipas also brought with him his mother and Ptolemy the brother of Nicolaus Chap IX ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS  35 Nicolaus one that had been Herod s most honoured friend and was now zealous for Antipas  but it was Ireneus the orator and one who on account of his reputation for sagacity was en trusted with the affairs of the kingdom who most of all encou raged him to attempt to gain the kingdom by whose means it was that when some advised him to yield to Archelaus as to his elder brother and who had been declared king by their fa ther s last will he would not submit so to do And when he was come to Rome all his relations revolted to him  not out of their good will to him but out of their hatred to Archelaus though indeed they were most of all desirous of gaining their liberty and to be put under a Roman governor  but if there were too great an opposition made to that they thought Antipas preferable to Archelaus and so joined with him in order to procure the kingdom for him Sabinus also by letters accused Archelaus to Caesar 5 Now when Archelaus had sent in his papers to Caesar wherein he pleaded his right to the kingdom and his father s testament with the accounts of Herod s money and with Pto lemy who brought Herod s seal he so expected the event but when Caesar had read these papers and Varus s and Sabinus s letters with the accounts of the money and what were the an nual incomes of the kingdom and understood that Antipas had also sent letters to lay claim to the kingdom he summoned his friends together to know their opinions and with them Caius the son of Agrippa and of Julia his daughter xvhom he had adopted and took him and made him sit first of all and desired such as pleased to speak their minds about the affairs now be fore them Now Antipater Salome s son a very subtle orator and a bitter enemy to Archelaus spake first to this purpose  That  it was ridiculous in Archelaus to plead now to have the  kingdom given him since he had in reality taken already a the power over it to himself before Caesar had granted it to  him  and appealed to those bold actions of his in destroying  so many at the Jewish festival and if the men had acted un  justly it was but fit the punishing of them should have been  reserved to those that were out of the country but had the  power to punish them and not been executed by a man that  if he pretended to be a king he did an injury to Caesar by  usurping that authority before it was determined for him by  Caesar  but if he owned himself to be a private person his  case was much worse since he who was putting in for the  kingdom could by no means expect to have that power  granted him of which he had akeady deprived Ctesar by  taking it to himself He also touched sharply upon him E 2  and 36 ANTIOJUTIES OF THE JEWS Book XVII  and appealed to his changing the commanders in the army  and his sitting in the royal throne before hand and his deter  minatiou of law salts  all done as if he were no other than a  king He appealed also to his concessions to those that peti  tioned him on a public account and indeed doing such tilings  than which he could devise no greater if he had been already  settled in the kingdom by Caesar He also ascribed to him Â the releasing of the prisoners that were ia the Hippodrome  and many other things that either had been certainly done  by him or were believed to be done and easily might be be  lieved to have been done because they were of such a nature Â as to be usually done by young men and by such as out of  a desire of ruling seize upon the government too soon He  also charged him with his neglect of the funeral mourning for  his father and with having merry meetings the very night  in which he died  and that it was thence the multitude took Â the handle of raising a tumult and if Archelaus could thus  requite his dead father who had btstowed such benefits upon  him and bequeathed such great things to him by pretending  to shed tears for him in the day time like an actor on the  stage but every night making mirth for having gotten the  government he would appear to be the same Archelaus with  regard to Caesar if he granted him the kingdom which he  hath been to his father  since he had then dancing and sing  ing as though an enemy of his were fallen and not as though Â a man were carried to his funeral that was so nearly related  and had been so great a benefactor to him But he said that  the greatest crime of all was this that he came now before  Caesar to obtain the government by his grant while he had be Â Â fore acted in all things as he could have acted if Caesar him Â self who ruled all had fixed him firmly in the government  And what be most aggravated in his pleading was the slaugh  ter of those about the temple and the impiety of it as done  at the festival and how they were slain like sacrifices them  selves some of whom were foreigners and others of their Â o wn country till the temple was full of dead bodies  and all  this was done not by an alien but by one who pretended to  the lawful title of a king that he might complete the wicked  tyranny which his nature prompted him to and which is  hated by all men On which account his father never so  much as dreamed of making him his successor in the king  dom when he was of a sound mind because he knew his dis  position  and in his former and more authentic testament he  appointed his antagonist Antipas to succeed  but that Arche â laus was called by his father to that dignity when he was in Chap IX ANTIQJJITIES OF THE JEWS 37  a dying condition both of body and mind while Aniipas was  called when he was ripest in his judgment and of such strength  of body as made him capable of managing his own affairs  and if his father had the like notion of him formerly that lie Â hath now shewed yet hath he given a sufficient specimen what  a king he is likely to be when he hath in effect deprived  Caesar of that power of disposing of the kingdom which he  justly hath and hath not abstained from making a terrible Â slaughter of his fellow citizens in the temple while he was  but a private person   C So when Antipater had made this speech and had confirm ed what he had said by producing many witnesses from among Archelaus s own relations he made an end of his pleading Up on which Nicolaus arose up to plead for Archelaus and said  That what had been done at the temple was rather to be at  tributed to the mind of those that had been killed than to the  authority of Archelaus  for that those who were the authors  of such things are not only wicked in the injuries they do of  themselves but in forcing sober persons to avenge themselves  upon them Now it is evident that what these did in way  of opposition was done under pretence indeed against Arche  laus but in reality agninst Caesar himself for they after an in  jurious manner attacked and slew those who were sent by Ar  chelaus and who came only to put a stop to their doings  They had no regard either to God or to the festival whom  Antipater yet is not ashamed to patronize whether it be out  of his indulgence of an enmity to Archelaus or out of his  hatred of virtue and justice For as to those who begin such  tumults and first set about such unrighteous actions they are  the men who force those that punish them to betake them  selves to arms even against their will So that Antipater in  effect ascribes the rest of what was done to ail those who were  of counsel to the accusers for nothing which is here accused  of injustice has been done but what was derived from them  as its authors  nor are those things evil in themselves but so  represented only in order to do harm to Archelaus Such  is these men s inclinations to do an injury to a man that is of  their kindred their father s benefactor and familiarly ac  quainted with them and that hath ever lived in friendship  with them  for that as to this testament it was made by the  king when he was of a sound mind and so ought to be of more  authority than his former testament and that for this reason  because Caesar is therein left to be the judge and disposer of  all therein contained  and for Caesar he will not to be sure f at all imitate the unjust proceedings of those men who du  ring 38  ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XVII  ring Herod s whole life had on all occasions been joint parta Â kers of power with him and yet do zealously endeavour to  injure his determination while they have not themselves had  the same regard to their kinsman which Archelaus had  Casar will not therefore disannul the testament of a man  whom he had entirely supported of his friend and confede  rate and that which is committed to him in trust to ratify   nor will Caesar s virtuous and upright disposition which are  known and uncontested through all the habitable world imi  tate the wickedness of these men in condemning a king as a  madman and as having lost his reason while he hath bequeath Â ed the succession to a good son of his and to one who flies  to Ccesar s upright determination for refuge Nor can He  rod at any time have been mistaken in his judgment about a  successor while he shewed so much prudence as to submit all  to Caesar s determination 7 Now when Nicolaus had laid these things before Caesar he ended his plea whereupon Caesar was so obliging to Arche laus that he raised him up when he had cast himself down at his feet and said that  he well deserved the kingdom  and he soon let them know that he was so far moved in his favour that he would not act otherwise than his father s testament directed and than was for the advantage of Archelaus However while he gave this encouragement to Archelaus to depend on him secure ly he made no full determination about him  and when the as sembly was broken up he considered by himself whether he should confirm the kingdom to Archelaus or whether he should part it among all Herod s posterity  and this because they all stood in need of much assistance to support them CHAP X A edition of the Jews against Sabinus  and how Varus brought the authors of it to punishment   J I DUT before these things could be brought to a settlement  Malthace Archelaus s mother fell into a distemper and died of it and letters came from Varus the president of Syria which informed Caesar of the revolt of the Jews for af ter Archelaus was sailed the whole nation was in a tumult So Varus since he was there himself brought the authors of the disturbance to punishment and when he had restrained them for the most part from this sedition which was a great one he took his journey to Antioch leaving one legion of his army at Jeru salem to keep the Jews quiet who were now very fond of inno vation Yet did not this at all avail to put an end to that their sedition  Ctap X ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 3Â sedition  for after Varns was gone away Sabinus Caesar s pro curator staid behind and greatly distressed the Jews relying on the forces that were left there that they would by their multi tude protect him  for he made use of them and armed them as his guards thereby so oppressing the Jews and giving them so great disturbance that at length they rebelled  for he used force in seizing the citadels and zealously pressed on the search af ter the king s money in order to seize upon it by force on account of his love of gain and his extraordinary covetousness 2 But the approach of Pentecost which is a festival of ours so called from the days of our forefathers a great many ten thou sands of men got together  nor did they come only to celebrate the festival but out of their indignation at the madness of Sabi nns and at the injuries he offered them A great number there was of Galileans and Idumeans and many men from Jericho and others who had passed over the river Jordan and inhabited those parts This whole multitude joined themselves to all the rest and were more zealous than the others in making an assault on Sabinus in order to be avenged on him  so they parted them selves into three bands and encamped themselves in the places following  some of them seized on the Hippodrome and of the other two bands one pitched themselves from the northern part of the temple to the southern on the east quarter but the third band held the western part of the city where the king s palace was Their work tended entirely to besiege the Romans and to inclose them on all sides Now Sabinus was afraid of these mens number and of their resolution who had little regard to their lives but were very desirous not to be overcome while they thopght it a point of puissance to overcome their enemies  so he sent immediately a letter to Varus and as he used to do was very pressing with him and entreated him to come quickly to his assistance  because the forces he had left were in imminent danger and would probably in no long time be seized upon and cut to pieces  while he did himself get up to the highest tower of the fortress Fhasaelus which had been built in honour of Pha saelus king Herod s brother and called so when the  Parthians had brought him to his death So Sabinus gave thence a signal to the Romans to fall upon the Jews although he ihd not him self venture so much as to come down to his friends and thought he might expect that the others should expose themselves first to die on account of his avarice However the Romans ventured to make a sally out of the place and a terrible battle ensued  wherein though it is true the Romans beat their adversaries yet  See Anti j B XIV ch xiii J 10 and Of the War B H ch xii Â 9 40 ANTIOJttTES OF THE JEWS Book XVIf yet were not the Jews daunted in their resolutions even when they had the sight of that terrible slaughter that was made of them  but they went round about and got upon those cloisters which encompassed the outer court of the temple where a great fight was still continued and they cast stones at the Romans partly with their hands and partly with slings as being much used to those exercises All the archers also in array did the Romans a great deal of mischief because they used their hands dextrously from a place superior to the others and because the others were at an utter loss what to do for when they tried to shoot their arrows against the Jews upwards these arrows could not reach them insomuch that the Jews were easily too hard for their enemies And this sort of fight lasted a great while till at last the Romans who were greatly distressed by what was done set fire to the cloisters so privately that those who were gotten upon them did not perceive it This fire  being fed by a great deal of combustible matter caught hold imme diately on the roof of the cloisters  so the wood which was full of pitch and wax and whose gold was laid on it with wax yielded to the flame presently and those vast works which were of the highest value and esteem were destroyed utterly while those that were on the roof unexpectedly perished at the same time  for as the roof tumbled down some of these men tumbled down with it and others of them were killed by their enemies who encom passed them There was a great number more who out of de spair of saving their lives and out of astonishment at the mise ry that surrounded them did either cast themselves into the fire or threw themselves upon their own swords and so got out of their misery But as to those that retired behind the same way by which they ascended and thereby escaped they were all kill ed by the Romans as being unarmed men and their courage failing them  their wild fury being now not able to help them because they were destitute of armour insomuch that of those that wen t up to the top of the roof not one escaped The Ro mans also rushed through the fire where it gave them room so to do and seized on that treasure where the sacred money was reposited  a great part of which was stolen by the soldiers and Sabinus got openly four hundred talents 3 But this calamity of the Jews friends who fell in this battle grieved them as did also this plundering of the money dedicated to God  These great devastations made about the temple here and of the War B II ch Hi J 3 seem uot to have been fully re edified in the days of Nero nil whose time there were 18 000 workmen continually employed in rebuilding and repairing that temple as Josephus informs us Antig B XX ch ix j 7 SeÂ Â

set fire to it and kill all that were in it Yet still they commanded them to go out presently and promi sed that if they would do so they would not hurt them nor Sa binus neither  at which time the greatest part of the king s troops deserted to them while Rufus and Gratus who had three thousand of the most warlike of Herod s army with them who were men of active bodies went over to the Romans There was also a band of horsemen under the command of Rufus which itself went over to the Romans also However the Jews went on with the siege and dug mines under the palace walls and besought those that were gone over to the other side not to be their hindrance now they had such a proper opportunity for the recovery of their country s ancient liberty  and for Sabinus truly he was desirous of going away with his soldiers but was not able to trust himself with the enemy on account of what mischief he had already done them  and he took this great pre tended lenity of theirs for an argument why he should not com ply with them  and so because he expected that Varus was co ming he still bore the siege 4 Now at this time there were ten thousand other disorders in Judea which were like tumults because a great number put themselves into a warlike posture either out of hopes of gain to themselves or out of enmity to the Jews In particular two thousand of Herod s old soldiers who had been already disband ed got together in Judea itself and fought against the king s troops  although Achiabus Herod s first cousin opposed them  but as he was driven out of the plains into the mountainous parts by the military skill of those men he kept himself in the fast nesses that were there and saved what he could 5 There was also Judas  the son of that Ezekias who had been head of the

and rending those that came near him  and all this in order to raise himself and out of art  ambitious desire of the royal dignity  and he hoped to obtain that as the reward not of his virtuous skill in war but of his extravagance in doing injuries 6 There was also Simon who had been a slave of Herod the king but in other respects a comely person of a tall and robust body  he was one that was much superior to others of his order and had had great things committed to his care This man was elevated at the disorderly state of things and was so bold as to put a diadem on his head while a certain number of the people stood by him and by them he was declared to be a king and thought himself more worthy of that dignity than any one else He burnt down the royal palace at Jericho and plundered what was left in it He also set fire to many other of the king s hou ses in several places of the country and utterly destroyed them and permitted those that were with him to take what was left in them for a prey and he would have done greater things unless care had been taken to repress him immediately  for Gratus when he had joined himself to some Roman soldiers took the forces he had with him and met Simon and after a great and a long fight no small part of those that came from Perea who were a disordered body of men and fought rather in a bold than in a skilful manner were destroyed and although Simon had saved himself by flying away through a certain valley yet Gra tus overtook him and cut off his head The royal palace also at Amathus by the river Jordan was burnt down by a party of men that were got together as were those belonging to Simon And thus did a great and wild fury spread itself over the na tion because they had no king to keep the multitude in good order and because those foreigners who came to reduce the se ditious to sobriety did on the contrary set them more in a flame because of the injuries thay offered them and the avari cious management of their affairs 7 But because Athronges a person neither eminent by the dignity of his progenitors nor for any great wealth he was pos sessed of but one that had in all respects been a shepherd only and was not known by any body  yet because he was a tall man and excelled others in the strength of his hands he was so bold as to set up for king Tin s man thought it So sweet a thing to Chap X 43 ANTIQU iTIES OF THE JEWS do more then ordinary injuries to others that although he should be killed he did not much care if he lost his life in so great a de sign He had also four brethren who were tall men themselves and were believed to be superior toothers in the strength of their hands and thereby were encouraged to aim at great things and thought that strength of theirs would support them in retaining the kingdom Each of these ruled over a band of men of their own for those that got together to them were very numerous They were every one of them also commanders but when they came to fight they were subordinate to him and fought for him while he put a diadem about his head and assembled a council to debate about what things should be done and all things were done according to his pleasure And this man retained his power a great while  he was also called king and had nothing to hinder him from doing what he pleased He also as well as his brethren slew a great many both of the Romans and of the king s forces and managed matters with the like hatred to each of them The king s forces they fell upon because of the li centious conduct they had been allowed under Herod s govern ment and they fell upon the Romans because of the injuries they had so lately received from them But in process of time they grew more cruel to all sorts of men  nor could any one escape from one or other of these seditions since they slew some out of the hopes of gain and others from a mere custom of slay ing men They once attacked a company of Romans at Emmaus who were bringing corn and weapons to the army and fell up on Arius the centurion who commanded the company and shot forty of the best of his foot soldiers  but the rest of them were affrighted at their slaughter and left their dead behind them but saved themselves by the means of Gratus who came with the king s troops that were about him to their assistance Now these four brethren continued the war a long while by such sort of expeditions and much grieved the Romans  but did their own nation also a great deal of mischief Yet were they after ward subdued one of them in a fight with Gratus another with Ptolemy  Archelaus also took the eldest of them prisoner  while the last of them was so dejected at the other s misfortune and saw so plainly that he had no way now left to save himself his army being worn away with sickness and continual labours that he also delivered himself up to Archelaus upon his promise and oath to God to preserve his life But these things came to pass a good while afterward 8 And now Judea was full of robberies and as the several companies of the seditious light upon any one to head them be was created a king immediately in order to do mischief to the F 2 public 44 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XVII public They were in some small measure indeed and in small matters hurtful to the Romans  but the murders they commit ted upon their own people lasted a long while 0 As soon as Varus was once informed of the state of Tudea by Sabinus s writing to him he was afraid for the legion he had left there  so he took the two other legions for there were three legions in all belonging to Syria and four troops of horse men with the several auxiliary forces which either the kings or certain of the tetrarchs afforded him and made what haste he could to assist those that were then besieged in Judea He also gave order that all that were sent out for this expedition should make haste to Ptolemais The citizens of Berytus also gave him 1500 auxiliaries as he passed through their city Aretas also the king of Arabia Petrea out of his hatred to Herod and in order to purchase the favour of the Romans sent him no small assistance besides their footmen and horsemen and when he had riow collected all his forces together he committed part of them to his son and to a friend of his and sent them upon an expe dition into Galilee which lies in the neighbourhood of Ptole mais  who made an attack upon the enemy and put them to flight and took Sephoris and made its inhabitants slaves and burnt the city But Varus himself pursued his march for Sa maria with his whole army  yet did not he meddle with the ci ty of that name because it had not at all joined with the sedi tious  but pitched his camp at a certain village that belonged to Ptolemy whose name was Arus which the Arabians burnt out of their hatred to Herod and out of the enmity they bore to his fnends whence they marched to another village whose name was Sampho which the Arabians plundered and burnt although it was a fortified and a strong place  and all along this march nothing escaped them but all places were full of fire and of slaughter Emmaus was also burnt by Varus s order after its inhabitants had deserted it that he might avenge those that had there been destroyed From thence he now marched to Jeru salem  whereupon those lews whose camp lay there and who had besieged the Roman legion not bearing the coming of this army left the siege imperfect But as to the Jerusalem Jews when Varus reproached them bitterly for what had been done they cleareu themselves of the accusation and alledged that the conflux of the people was occasioned by the feast that the war was not made with their approbation but the rashness of the strangers while they were on the side of the Romans and be sieged together with them rather than having any inclination to besiege them There also came before hand to meet Varus Jo seph the cousin german of king Herod as also Gratus and Ru  XI ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 45 fus who brought their soldiers along with them together with those Romans who had been besieged  but Sabinus did not come into Varus s presence but stole out of the city privately and went to the sea side  10 Upon this Varus sent a part of his army into the country to seek out those that had been the authors of the revolt and when they were discovered he punished some of them that were most guilty and some he dismissed  now the number of those that were crucified on this account we re two thousand After which he disbanded his army which he found nowise useful to him in the affairs he came about for they behaved themselves very disorderly and disobeyed his orders and what Varus de sired them to do and this out of regard to that gain which they made by the mischief they did As for himself when he was informed that ten thousand Jews had gotten together he mad haste to catch them  but they did not proceed so far as to fight him but by the advice of Achiabus they came together and delivered themselves up to him  hereupon Varus forgave the prime of revolting to the multitude but sent their several com manders to Caesar many of whom Caesar dismissed  but for the several relations of Herod who had been among these men in this war they were the only persons whom he punished who with put the least regard to justice fought against their own kindred CHAP XI rfÂ anibatsage of the Jews to Casar  and imu Casar confirmed Herod s testament Â i CO when Varus had settled these affairs and had placed  the former legion at Jerusalem he returned back to Antioch  but as for Archelaus he had new sources of trouble come upon him at Rome on the occasions following  for an am bassage of the Jews was come to Rome Varus having permit ted the nation to send it that they might petition for the liberty of living by their own laws  Now the number of the am bassadors that were sent by the authority of the nation was fifty to which they joined above eight thousand of the Jews that were at Rome already Hereupon Caesar assembled his friends and the chief men among the Romans in the temple of Apollo f which he had built at a vast charge  whither the ambassadors came and a multitude of the Jews that were there already came with them as did also Archelaus and his friends  but as for the several kinsmen which Archelaus had they would not join themselves Â See Of the War B II ch ii sect 3 t Set

Â against him as supposing it would be a disgrace to them in Caesar s opinion to think of thus acting in opposition to a man of their own kindred  Philip also was come hither out of Syria by the persuasion of Varus with this principal intention to as sist his brother Archelaus  for Varus was his great friend but still so that if there should any change happen in the form of government which Varus suspected there would and if any distribution should be made on account of the number that desired the liberty of living by their own laws that he might not be disappointed but might have his share in it 2 Now upon the liberty that was given to the Jewish am bassadors to speak they who hoped to obtain a dissolution of kingly government betook themselves to accuse Herod of his iniquities and they declared  That he was indeed in name a  king but that he had taken to himself that uncontroulable au  thority which tyrants exercise over their subjects and had  made use of that authority for the destruction of the Jews and Â did not abstain from making many innovations among them be  sides according to his own inclinations  and that whereas there Â were a great many who perished by that destruction he brought  upon them so many indeed as no other history relates they  that survived were far more miserable than those that suffered  under him not only by the anxiety they were in from his  looks and disposition towards them but from the danger their  estates were in of being taken away by him That he did Â never leave off adorning these cities that lay in their neigh  bourhood but were inhabited by foreigners  but so that the  cities belonging to his own government were ruined and ut Â terly destroyed that whereas when he took the kingdom Â it was in an extraordinary flourishing condition he had filled Â the nation with the utmost degree of poverty  and when  upon unjust pretences he had slain any of the nobility he took  away their estates i and when he permitted any of them to  live he condemned them to the forfeiture of what they pos  sessed And besides the annual impositions which he laid  upon every one of them they were to make liberal presents  to himself to his domestics and friends and to such of his  slaves as were vouchsafed the favour of being his tax gather  ers  because there was no way of obtaining a freedom from Â unjust violence without giving either gold or silver for it  Tjjat they would say nothing of the corruption of the chastity  of their virgins and the reproach laid on their wives for in Â contuiency  He was tetrarch afterward Chap XI ANTIQUITIES OF TtfE JEWS 47  continency and those things acted after an insolent and in  human manner because it was not a smaller pleasure to the  sufferers to have such things concealed than it would have  been to have suffered them That Herod had put such ab  uses upon them as a wild beast would not have put on them  if he had power given him to rule over us  and that although  their nations had passed through many subversions and altera  tions of government their history gave no account of any ca  lamity they had ever been under that could be compared with  this which Herod had brought upon their nation  that it was  for this reason that they thought they might justly and gladly  salute Archelaus as king upon this supposition that whoso  ever should be set over their kingdom he would appear more  mild to them than Herod had been  and that they had joined  with him in the mourning for his father in order to gratify  him and were ready to oblige him in other points also if they  could meet with any degree of moderation from him  but  that he seemed to be afraid lest he should not be deemed He  rod s own son  and so without any delay  and he immediate  ly let the nation understand his meaning and this before his  dominion was well established since the power of disposing of  it belonging to Caesar who could either give it to him or not  as he pleased That he had given a specimen of his future  virtue to his subjects and with what kind of moderation and  good administration he would govern them by that his first ac  tion which concerned them his own citizens and God himself  also when he made the slaughter of three thousand of his own  countrymen at the temple How then could they avoid the  just hatred of him who to the rest of his barbarity hath add  ed this as one of our crimes that we have opposed and con  tradicted him in the exercise of his authority  Now the main thing they desired was this That they might be delivered from  kingly and the like forms of government and might be add  ed  If any ore compare that divine prediction concerning the tyrannical power which Jewifli kings would exercise over them if they would be so foolifli as to prefer it before their ancient theocracy or aristocracy i Sara viii iâ An tiq B 1 ch iv  4 he will soon find that it was super abundantly fulfilled in the days of Herod and that to such a degree that the nation now at last seem sorely to repent of such their ancient choice in opposition to God s better choice for them and had much rather be subject to even a Pagan Roman government and their deputies than to be any longer under the oppression of the family of Herod which request of theirs Augustus did not now grant them bnt did it for the one half of that nation in a few years afterward upon fresh complaints made by the Jews against Archelaus who under the more humble name of aii eihnarch which Augustus only would now allow him soon took upon him the insolence and tyranny of his father king Herod as the remaining part of thi kouk will inform us and particularly chap xiii sect 2 48 ANTIQJJITIES OF THE JEWS Book XVII  ed to Syria and be put under the authority of such presidents  of theirs as should be sent to them for that it would thereby  be made evident whether they be really a seditious people  and generally fond of innovations or whether they would Â live in an orderly manner if they might have governors of  any sort of moderation set over them 3 Now when the Jews had said this Nicolaus vindicated the kings from those accusations and said That  as for Herod  since he had never been thus accused  all the time of his life  it was not fit for those that might have accused them of lesser  crimes than those now mentioned and might have procured him  to be punished during his life time to bring an accusation  against him now he is dead He also attributed the actions  of Archelaus to the Jews injuries to him who affecting to go  vern contrary to the laws and going about to kill those that  would have hindered them from acting unjustly when they  were by him punished for what they had done made their  complaints against him  so he accused them of their attempts  for innovation and of the pleasure they took in sedition by  reason of their not having learned to submit to justice and Â to the laws but still desiring to be superior in all things This was the substance of what Nicolaus said 4 When Caesar had heard these pleadings he dissolved the assembly  but a few days afterwards he appointed Archelaus not indeed to be king of the whole country but ethnarch of the one half of that which had been subject to Herod and promised to give him the royal dignity hereafter if he governed his part virtuously But as for the other half he divided it into two parts and gave it to two other of Herod s sons to Philip and to Antipas that Antipas who disputed with Archelaus for the whole kingdom Now to him it was that Perea and Galilee paid their tribute which amounted f annually to two hundred ta lents  This is not tnie See Antiq B XIV cli ix sect 3 4 and ch xii sect i and ch xiii sect i i Antiq B XV ch iii sect 5 and ch z sect Â 3 An tiq B XVI ch ix sect 3  t Since Josephus here informs us that Archelaus had one half of the kingdom of Herod and presently informs us farther that Archelaus s annual income after an abatement of one quarter for the present was 600 talents we may therefore gather pretty nearly what was Herod the Great s yearly income I mean about 1600 talents which at the known value of 3000 shekels to a talent and about is lod to a shekel in the days of Josephus see the note on Antiq B III ch viii Â ect 2 amounts to L 680 000 Sterling per annum  which income tjiough great in itself bearing no proportion to his vast expences every where visible in Jose phus and to the vast sums he left behind him in his will chap viii sect i and chap xii sect i the rest must have arisen either from his confiscation of those great men s esiates whom he put to death or made to pay fine for the saving of their lives or from some other heavy methods of oppression Which such savage tyrants usually exercise upon their miserable subjects or rather from these sere Chap XI ANTIOJUTlES OF THE JEWS 49 lents while Batanea with Trachonitis as well as Auranitis with a certain  part of what was called the house of Zenodorus paid the tribute of one hundred talents to Philip  but Idumea and Judea and the country of Samaria paid tribute to Arche laus but had now a fourth part of that tribute taken off by the order of Caesar who decreed them that mitigation because they did not join in this revolt with the rest of the multitude There were also certain of the cities which paid tribute to Archelaus Strato s tower and Sebaste with Joppa and Jerusalem  for as to Gaza and Gadara and Hippos they were Grecian cities which Caesar separated from his government and added them to the province of Syria Now the tribute money that came to Archelaus every year from his own dominions amounted to six hundred talents 5 And so much came to Herod s sons from their father s in heritance But Salome besides what her brother left her by his testament which were Jamnia and Ashdod and Phasaelis and five hundred thousand drachmae of coined silver Caesar made her a present of a royal habitation at Askelon 5 in all her revenues amounted to sixty talents by the year and her dwell ing house was within Archelaus s government The rest also of the king s relations received what his testament allotted them Moreover Caesar made a present to each of Herod s two virgin daughters besides what their father left them of two hundred and fifty thousand drachmae  of silver and married them to Pheroras s sons  he also granted all that was bequeathed to him self to the king s sons which was one thousand five hundred ta lents excepting a few of the vessels which he reserved forhim VOL III Â â G self ral methods put together all which yet seem very much too small for his exprn ces being drawn from no larger a nation than that of the Jews which was very populous but without the advantage of trade to bring them riches so that I can not but strongly suspect that no small part of this his wealth arose from another source I mean from some vast sums he took out of David s sepulchre but con cealed from the people See tlie note on Antiq B Vli ch xv sect 3  Take here a very useful note of Grotius on Luke B 111 ch i here quoted by Dr Hudson   When Josephuss ays that some part of the house or possession  of Zenodorus i e Abilene was allotted to Philip he thereby declares that  the larger part of it belonged to another this 01 her was Lysanias who ii  Luke mentions of the posterity of that Lysanias who was possessed of the  same country called dbiievc from the city Abila and by others Chalcidene  from the city Chalcis when the government of the cast was under Antonius  and this after Ptolemy the son of Mennius trom which Lysanias this coun  try came to be commonly cilltd the Country of Lyianiat and as after the  death of the former Lysanias it was called the tetrarcby of Zencilorus it  after the death of Zenodorus or wttih the time for which h hired it was  ended when another Lysanias of the same name with the former wai posv  sessed of the same country it begun to be called the trtiurchy of iysanini However since Josephuselsewhere Antiq B XX ch vii  i clearly distinguiJh eÂ Abilene from Chaicidine Grotius must be here so far misukcn 5ft ANTIQJT1ES OF THE JEWS Book XVII self and they were acceptable to him not so much for the great value they were of as because they were memorials of the king to him CHAP XII Concerning a Spurious Alexander  â W ese affairs had been thus settled by Caesar a   certain young man by birth a Jew but brought up by a Roman freed man in the city Sidon ingrafted himself into the kindred of Herod by the resemblance of his countenance which those that saw him attested to be that of Alexander the son of Herod whom he had slain  and this was an incitement to him to endeavour to obtain the government so he took to him as an assistant a man of his own country one that was well acquainted with the affairs of the palace bat on other ac counts an ill man and one whose nature made him capable of causing great disturbances to the public and one that became a teacher of such a mischievous contrivance to the other and de clared himself to be Alexander and the son of Herod but stolen away by one of those that were sent to slay him who in reali ty slew other men in order to deceive the spectators but saved both him and his brother Aristobulus Thus was this man ela ted and able to impose on those that came to him  and when he was come to Crete he made all the Jews that came to discourse with him believe him to be Alexander And when he had gotten much money which had been presented to him there he passed over to Melos where he got much more money than he had before out of the belief they had that he was of the royal family and their hopes that he would recover his father s prin cipality and reward his benefactors  so he made haste to Rome and was conducted thither by those strangers who entertained him He was also so fortunate as upon his landing at Dice archia to bring the Jews that were there into the same delu sion  and not only other people but also all those that had been great with Herod or had a kindness for him joined themselves to this man as to their king The cause of it was this that men were glad of his pretences which were seconded by the likeness of his countenance which made those that had been acquainted with Alexander strongly to believe that he was no other but the very same person which they also confirmed to others by oath  â insomuch that when the report went about him that he was co ming to Rome the whole multitude of the Jews that were there went out to meet him ascribing it to divine Providence that he had so unexpectedly escaped and being very joyful on account of Chap XII ANTIQJJITIES OF THE JEWS 51 of his mother s family And when he was come he was car Sried in a royal litter through the streets and all the ornaments about him was such as kings are adorned withal and this was at the expence of those that entertained him The multitude also flocked about him greatly and made mighty acclamations to him and nothing was omitted which could be thought suit able to such as had been so unexpectedly preserved 2 When this thing was told Caesar he did not believe it be cause Herod was not easily to be imposed upon in such affairs as were of great concern to him  yet having some suspicion it might be so he sent one Celadus a freed man of his and one that had conversed with the young men themselves and bade him bring Alexander into his presence  so he brought him being no more accurate in judging about him than the rest of the multi tude Yet did not he deceive Caesar for although there were a resemblance between him and Alexander yet was it not so ex act as to impose on such as were prudent in discerning  for this spurious Alexander had his hands rough by the labours he had been put to and instead of that softness of body which the other had and this as derived from his delicate and generous educar tion this man for the contrary reason had a rugged body When therefore Caesar saw how the master and the scholar agreed in this lying story and in a bold way of talking he in quired about Aristobulus and asked what became of him who it seems was stolen away together with him and for what reason it was that he did not come along with him and endea vour to recover that dominion which was due to his high birth fclso And when he said That  he had been left in the isle  of Crete for fear of the dangers of the sea that in case any Â accident should come to himself the posterity of Mariamne  might not utterly perish but that Aristobulus might sur  vive and punish those that laid such treacherous designs a  gainst them And when he persevered in his affirmations and the author of the imposture agreed in supporting it Caesar took the young man by himself and said to him Â If thou wilt  not impose upon me thou shalt have this for thy reward that  thou shalt escape with thy life  tell me then who thou art  and who it was that had boldness enough to contrive such a  cheat as this For this contrivance is too considerable a piece  of villany to be undertaken by one of thy age According ly because he had no other way to take he told Caesar the con trivance and after what manner and by whom it was laid to gether So Caesar upon observing the spurious Alexander to be a strong active man and fit to work with his hands that he Anight not break his promise to him put him among those that G 2 were pg ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Bopk XVII were to row among the mariners but slewJiim that induced him to do what he had done  for as for the people of Melos he thought them sufficiently punished in having thrown away so much of their money upon this spurious Alexander And such was the ignominious conclusion of this bold contrivance a r bout the spurious Alexander  â   r  i â    â  CHAP XIII How ArcT elaust upon a second Accusation Mas latusbed to Vienna Archelaus was entered on his ethnarchy and was come into Judea he accused loazar the son of Boethus of assisting the seditious and took away the high priest hood from him and put Eleazer his brother in his place He also magnificently rebuilt the royal palace that had been at Jeri cho and he diverted half the water with which the village of Neara used to be watered and drew off that water into the plain to water those palm trees which he had there planted  he also built a village and put his own name upon it and called it Archekis Moreover he  transgressed the law of our fathers and married Glaphyra the daughter of Archelaus who had been the wife of his brother Alexander which Alexander had three children by her while it was a thing detestable among the Jews to marry the brother s wife  nor did this Eleazer abide long in the high priesthood Jesus the son of Sie being put in his room while he was still living 2 But in the tenth year of Archelaus s government both his brethren and the principal men of Judea and Samafia not being able to bear his barbarous and tyrannical usage of them accused him before Caesar and that especially because they knew he had broken the commauds of Caesar which obliged him to behave himself with moderation among them Whereupon Caesar when he heard it was very angry and called for Arche laus s steward who took care of his affairs at Rome and whose name was Archelaus also and thinking it beneath him to write to Archelaus he bid him sail away as soon as possible and bring him to us  so the man made haste in his voyage and when he came into Judea he found Archelaus feasting with his friends  BO he told him what Ctcsar had sent him about and hastened him away And when he was come to Rome Caesar upon hear ing what certain accusers of his had to say and what reply he could  Spanheim seasonably observes here that it was forbidden th e Jews to marry their brother s wife when she had children by her first husband and that 2p aoras cites or interprets the clause before us accordingly Chap XIII ANTIQUHfES Of THE JEWS fj8 could make both banished him and appointed Vienrra a city of Gaul to be the place of his habitation and took his money a way from him 3 Now before Archelaus was gone up to Rome upon this message he related this dream to his friends that  he saw cars  of corn in number ten full of wheat perfectly ripe which  ears as it seemed to him were devoured by oxen And when he was awake and gotten up because the vision appeared to be of great importance to him he sent for the diviners whose study was employed about dreams And while some were of one opinion aud some of another for all their interpretations did not agree Simon a man of the sect of the Essens desired leave to speak his mind freely and said that  the vision deno  ted a change in the affairs of Archelaus and that not for the  better  that oxen because that animal takes uneasy pains in  his labours denoted afflictions and indeed denoted farther a  change of affairs  because that land which is ploughed by ox  en cannot remain in its former state  and that the ears of corn  being ten determined the like number of years because an  ear of corn grows in one year  and that the time of Arche  laus s government was over And thus did this man ex pound the dream Now on the fifth day after this dream came first to Archelaus the other Archelaus that was sent to Judea by Caesar to call him away came hither also 4 The like accident befel Glaphyra his wife who was the daughter of king Archelaus who as I said before was married while she was a virgin to Alexander the son of Herod and bro ther of Archelaus but since it fell out so that Alexander was slain by his father she was married to Juba the king of Lydia and when he was dead and she lived in widowhood in Cappadocia with her father Archelaus divorced his former wife Mariamne and married her so great was his affection for this Glaphyra  who during her marriage to him saw the following dream She thought  she saw Alexander standing by her at which she re  joiced and embraced him with great affection  but that he  complained of her and said O Glaphyra  thou provest that  saying to be true which assures us that women are not to be  trusted Didst not thou pledge thy faith to me  and wast not  thou married to me when thou wast a virgin  and had we not  children between us  Yet hast thou forgotten the affection  I bare to thee out oi the desire of a second husband Nor hast  thou been satisfied with that injury thou didst me but thou  hast been so bold as to procure thee a third husband to lie by thee and in au indecent and imprudent manner hast entered in Â tQ 54 Book XVII ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS  to my house and hast been married to Archelaus thy husband  and my brother However I will not forget thy former kind  affection for me but will set thee free from every such rer  proachful action and cause thee to be mine again as thou   once wast When she had related this to her female compa nions in a few days time she departed this life 5 Now I did not think these histories improper for the pre sent discourse both because my discourse now is concerning kings and otherwise also on account of the advantage hence to be drawn as well as for the confirmation of the immortality of the soul as of the providence of God over human affairs I thought them fit to be set down but if any one does not believe such relations let him indeed enjoy his own opinion but let him not hinder another that would thereby encourage himself in virtue So Archelaus s country was laid to the province of Syria and Cyrenius one that had been consul was sent by Caesar to take account of people s effects in Syria and to sell the house of Archelaus BOOK Chap I 35 ANTIQJJITIES OF THE JEWS BOOK XVIII Containing the interval of thirty two years From the banishment of Archelaus to the departure of the Jews from Babylon CHAP I  Mow Cyrenius was sent by Ccesar to make a taxation of Syria and Judea  and how Coponius was sent to be procurator of Judea  concerning Judas of Galilee and concerning the sects that were among the Jews  I VTOW Cyrenius a Roman senator and one who had gone through other magistracies and had passed through them till he had been consul and ope who on other

equestrian order was sent together with him to have the su preme power over the Jews Moreover Cyrenius came him self into Judea which was now added to the province of Syria to take an account of their substance and to dispose of Ar he laus s money  but the Jews although at the beginning they took the report of a taxation heinously yet did they leave off any farther opposition to it by the persuasion of Joazar who was the son of Eoethus and high priest so they being over persuaded by Joazar s words gave an account of their estates without any dispute about it Yet was there one Judas  a

Dean Aldrich observes On the War B II ch viii Â 1 Nor can one well imagine why he should here call him a Gaulonite when in the 6th sect following here as well as twice Of the War he still calls him a Galilean As for the city of Gamala whence this udas was derived it determines nothing since there were two of that name the one in Gaulonitis the other in Galilee See Reland on the city or town of that name ANTIQJJItlES OF THE JEWS Book XVIII Gaulonite of a city whose name was Gamala who taking with him Saddouk  a Pharisee became zealous to draw thenv to a revolt who both said that this taxation was no better than an introduction to slavery and exhorted the nation to assert their liberty  as if they could procure them happiness and security for what they possessed and assured enjoyment of a still great er good which was that of the honour and glory they would thereby acquire for magnanimity They also said that God would not otherwise be assisting to them than upon their joiiv ing with one another in such counsels as might be successful and for their own advantage  and this especially if they would set about great exploits and not grow weary in executing the same  so men received what they said with pleasure and this bold attempt proceeded to a great height All sorts of misfor tunes also sprang from these men and the nation was infected with this doctrine to an incredible degree  one violent war came upon us after another and we lost our friends which used to alleviate our pains  there were also very great robberies and murders of our principal men This was done in pretence indeed for the public welfare but in reality from the hopes of gain to themselves whence arose seditions and from them murders of men which sometimes fell on those of their own people by the madness of these men towards one another while their desire was that none of the adverse party might be left and sometimes on their enemies  a famine also coming upon us reduced us to the last degree of despair as did also the taking and demolishing of cities nay the sedition at last increased so high that the very temple of God was burnt down by their enemies fire Such were the consequences of this that the customs of our fathers were altered and such a change was made as added a mighty weight toward bringing all to destruction which these men oc casioned by their thus conspiring together for Judas and Saddu cus f who excited a fourth philosophic sect among us and had a great many followers therein filled our civil government with tumults at present and laid the foundations of our future mise ries by this system of philosophy which we were before unac quainted withal concerning which I will discourse a little and this  It seems not very improbable to me that this Sadduc the Pharisee was the very same man of whom the Rabbins speak as the unhappy but undesigning oc casion of the impiety or infidelity of the Sadducees nor perhaps had the men this name of Sadducees till this very time though they were a distinct sect long before See the note on B XIII ch x sect 5 and Dean Prideaux as there quoted nor do we that I know of find the least footsteps of such impiety or infidelity of these Sadducees before this time the Recognitions assuring us that they began about the days of John the Baptist B I ch Iiv  â f See Note above Chap I ANTIQJJITIES OF THE JEWS tl this the rather because the infection which spread thence among the younger sort who were zealous for it brought the public to destruction 2 The Jews had for a great while had three sects of philoso phy peculiar to themselves the sect of the Essens and the sect of the Sadducees and the third sort of opinions was that of those called Pharisees  of which sects although I have already spoken in the second book of the Jewish war yet will I a little touch upon them now 3 Now for the Pharisees thty live meanly and despise de licacies in diet and they follow the contract of reason  and what that prescribes to them as good for them they do  and they think they ought earnestly to strive to observe reason s dictates foe practice They also pay a respect to such as are in years  nor are they so bold as to contradict them in any thing which they have introduced and when they determine that all things are done by fate they do not take away the freedom from men of acting as thej think fit since their notion is that it hath pleased God to make a temperament whereby what he wills is done but so that the will of man can act virtuously or viciously They also believe that souls have an immortal vigour in them and that under the earth there will be rewards or punishments ac cording as they have lived virtuously or viciously in this life and the latter are to be detained in an everlasting prison but that the former shall have power to revive and live again  on account of which doctrines they are able greatly to persuade the body of the people  and whatsoever they do about divine worship prayers and sacrifices they perform them according to their direction  insomuch that the cities gave great attestations t6 them on account of their entire virtuous conduct both in the actions of their lives and their discourses also 4 But the doctrine of the Sadducees is this That souls die with the bodies  nor do they regard the observation of any thing besides what the law enjoins them  for they think it an instance of virtue to dispute with those teachers of philosophy whom they frequent but this doctrine is received but by a fewj yet by those still of the greatest dignity But they are able to do almost no thing of themselves  for when they become magistrates as they are unwillingly and by force sometimes obliged to be they ad dict themselves to the notions of the Pharisees because the mul titude would not otherwise bear them 5 The doctrine of the Essens is this That all things are best ascribed to God They teach the immortality of souls and e Steem that the rewards of righteousness are to be earnestly stri Voi III H  vea 5S ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XVIII ven for  and when they send what they have dedicated to God into the temple they do not offer sacrifices because they have more pure lustrations of their own  on which account they are excluded from the common court of the temple but offer their sacrifices themselves  yet is their course of life better than that of other men  and they entirely addict themselves to hus bandry It also deserves our admiration how much they exceed all other men that addict themselves to virtue and this in righ teousness  and indeed to such a degree that as it hath never appeared among any other men neither Greeks nor Barbarians no not for a little time so hath it endured for a long while among them This is demonstrated by that institution of theirs which will not suffer any thing to hinder them from having all things in common so that a rich man enjoys no more of his own wealth than he who hath nothing at all There are about four thousand men that live in this way and neither marry wives nor are desirous to keep servants  as thinking the latter tempts men to be unjust and the former gives the handle to domestic quarrels  but as they live by themselves they minister one to another They also appoint certain stewards to receive the in comes of their revenues and of the fruits of the ground  such as are good men and priests who are to get their corn and their food ready for them They none of them differ from others of the Essens in their way of living but do the most resemble those Dacae who are called Polistis dwellers in cities 6 But of the fourth sect of Jewish philosophy Judas the Ga lilean was the author These men agree in all other things with the Pharisaic notions but they have an inviolable attachment to liberty and say that God is to be their only Ruler and Lord They also do not value dying any kinds of death nor indeed do they heed the deaths of their relations and friends nor can any such fear make them call any man lord And since this immove able resolution of theirs is well known to a great many I shall speak no farther about that matter nor am I afraid that anything I  It seems by what Josephus says here and Philo himself elsewhere Op p 679 that these Essens did not use to go to the Jewish festivals at Jernsalem or to offer sacrifices there which may be one great occasion why they are never mentioned in the ordinary books of the New Testament though in the Apostoli cal Constitutions they are mentioned at those that observed the customs of their forefathers and that without any such ill character laid upon them as is there laid upon the oiher sects among that people t Who these ntXiml in Josephus or Kt Â in Strabo among the Pythagoric Dacae were it is not easy to determine Scaliger offers no improbable conjecture that some of these Dace lived alone like monks in tents or caves but that others of them lived together in built cities and thence were called by suck names as implied the same Chap II ANTIQUITIES OF THF JEWS  59 I have said of them should be disbelieved but rather fear that what I have said is beneath the resolution they shew when they undergo pain And it was in Gessius Florus s time that the na tion began to grow mad with this distemper who was our pro curator and who occasioned the Jews to go wild with it by the abuse of his authority and to make them revolt from the Ro mans And these are the sects of Jewish philosophy CHAP II â â  j How Herod and Philip luilt several cities in honour of Cccsar

conclu sion which were made in the thirty seventh of Caesar s victory over Antony at Actium he deprived Joazar of the high priest hood which dignity had been conferred on him by the multi tude and he appointed Ananus the son of Seth to be high priest while Herod and Philip had each of them received their own tetrarchy and settled the affairs thereof Herod also built a wall about Sepphoris which is the security of all Galilee and made it the metropolis of the country He also built a wall round Beth aramphtha which was itself a city also and called it Julias from the name of the emperor s wife When Philip also had built Paneas a city at the fountains of Jordan he named it Cerarea He also advanced the village Bethsaida situate at the lake of Gennesareth unto the dignity of a city both by the number of inhabitants it contained and its other grandeur and called it by the name of Julias the same name with Caesar s daughter 2 As Coponius who we told you was sent along with Cyre nius was exercising his office of procurator and governing Judea the following accidents happened As the Jews were celebra ting the feast of unleavened bread which we call the Passover it was customary for the priests to open the temple gates just after midnight When therefore those gates were first opened some of the Samaritans came privately into Jerusalem and threw a bout dead men s bodies in the cloisters on which account the Jews afterward excluded them out of the temple which they had not used to do at such festivals  and on other accounts also they watched the temple more carefully than they had formerly done A little after which accident Coponius returned to Rome and Marcus Ambivius came to be his successor in that government under whom Salome the sister of king Herod died and left to Julia CO ANTIQJJITIES OF THE JEWS Book XVIII Julia Caesar s wife Jatnnia all its toparchy and Phasaelis in the plain and Archelais where is a great plantation of palm trees and their fruit is excellent in its kind After him came Annius Rufus under whom died Caesar the second emperor of the Romans the duration of whose reign was fifty seven years besides six months and two days of which time Antonius ruled together with him fourteen years  but the duration of his life was seventy seven years  upon whose death Tiberius Nero his wife Julia s son succeeded He was now the third emperor and he sent Valerius Gratus to be procurator of Judea and to succeed Annius Rufus This man deprived Annus of the high priesthood and appointed Ismael the son of Phabi to be high priest He also deprived him in a little time and ordained Elea zar the son of Ananus who had been high priest before to be high priest which office when he had held for a year Gratus deprived him of it and gave the high priesthood to Simon the son of Camithus and when he had possessed that dignity no longer than a year Joseph Caiaphas was made his successor When Gratus had done those things he went back to Rome after he had tarried in Judea eleven years when Pontius Pilate came as his successor  3 And now Herod the tetrarch who was in great favou with Tiberius built a city of the same name with him and call ed it Tiberias He built it in the best part of Galilee at the lake of Gennesareth There are warm baths at a little distance from it in a village named E mmaus Strangers came and inhabited this city  a great number of the inhabitants vere Galileans also j and many were necessitated by Herod to come thither out of the country belonging to him and were by force compelled to be its inhabitants  some of them were persons of condition He also admitted poor people such as those that were collected from all parts to dwell in it Nay some of them were not quite free men  and these he xyas a benefactor to and made them free in great numbers but obliged them not to forsake the city by building them very good houses at his own expences and by giving them land also  for he was sensible that to make this place an habitation was to transgress the Jewish ancient laws because many sepulchres were to be here taken away in order to make room for the city Tiberias   whereas our laws pro nounce that such inhabitants are unclean for seven days f 4 About  We may here take notice aswell as in the parallel parts of the hooks Of the War B II ch ix sect i that after the death of Herod the Great and ihe sue cession of Archelaus Josephus is very brief in his accounts of Judea till near his own time I suppose the reason is that after the large history of N icolaus of Damascus including the life of Herod and probably the succession and first actions of his sons he had but few good histories of those times before him f Numb xfc 11â 14  Chap II  ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 61 4 About this time died Phraates king of the Parthians by the treachery of Phraataces his son upon the occasion following When Phraates had had legitimate sons of his own he had also an Italian maid servant whose name was Thermusc who had been formerly sent to him by Julius Caesar among other pre sents He first made her his concubine  but he being a great admirer of her beauty in process of time having a son by herr whose name was Paraataces he made her his legitimate wife and had a great respect for her Now she was able to persuade him to do any thing that she said and was earnest in procuring the government of Parthia for her son  but still she saw that her endeavours would not succeed unless she could contrive how to remove Phraates s legitimate sons out of the kingdom  so she persuaded him to send those his sons as pledges of his fidelity to Rome and they were sent to Rome accordingly because it was not easy for him to contradict her commands Now while Fhraataces was alone brought up in order to succeed in the go vernment he thought it very tedious to expect that government by his father s donation as his successor  he therefore formed a treacherous design against his father by his mother s assist ance with whom as the report went he had criminal conver sation also So he was hated for both these vices while his subjects esteemed this wicked love of his mother to be no way inferior to his parricide  and he was by them in a sedi tion expelled out of the country before he grew too great and died But as the best sort of Parthians agreed together that it was impossible they should be governed without a king while also it was their constant practice to chuse one of the family of Arsaces nor did their law allow of any others  and they thought this kingdom had been sufficiently injured already by the marriage with an Italian concubine and by her issue they sent ambassadors and called Orodes to take the crown  for the multitude would not otherwise have borne them  and though he were accused of very great cruelty and was of an untraciable temper and prone to wrath yet still he was one of the family of Arsaces However they made a conspiracy ru gainst him and slew him and that as some say at a festival and among their sacrifices  for it is the universal custom there to carry their swords with them  but as the more general re port is they slew him when they had drawn him out a hunt ing So they sent ambassadors to Rome and desired they would send one of those that were there as pledges to be their king Accordingly Vonones was preferred before the rest and sent to them for he seemed capable of such great fortune which two of the greatest kingdoms under the sun now offered him his own and a foreign one However the barbarians sooa 62 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XVIII soon changed their minds they being natural j of a mutable uisposition upon the supposal that this man was not worthy to be their governor  for they could not think of obeying the commands of one that had b en a slave for so they called those that had been hostages nor could they bear the ignominy of that name and this was the more intolerable because then the Par 1 iii i s must have such a king set over them not by right of war but in time of peace So they presently invited Artabanus king of Media to be their king he being also of the race of Arsaces Artabanus complied with the offer that was made him and came to them with an army So Vonones met him  and at first the multitude of the Parthians stood on his side and he put his army in array but Artabanus was beaten and fled to the moun tains of Media Yet did he a little after gather a great army together and fought with Vonones and beat him  whereupon Vonones fled away on horseback with a few of his attendants nbout him to Seleucia upon Tigris So when Artabanus had slain a great number and this after he had gotten the victory by reason of the very great dismay the barbarians were in he re fired to Ctesiphonwith a great number of his people  and so he now reigned over the Parthians But Vonones fled away to Ar menia  and as soon as he came thither he had an inclination to have the government of the country given him and sent ambas sadors to Rome for that purpose But because Tiberius refu sed it him and because he wanted courage and because the Par thian king threatened him and sent ambassadors to him to de nounce war against him if he proceeded and because he had no ivay to take to regain any other kingdom for the people of au thority among the Armenians about Niphates joined themselves to Artabanus he delivered up himself to Silanus the president of Syria who out of regard to his education at Rome kept him in Syria while Artabanus gave Armenia to Orodes one of his own sons 5 At this time died Antiochus the king of Commagene  whereupon the multitude contended with the nobility and both sent ambassadors to Rome  for the men of power were desi rous that their form of government might be changed into that of a Roman province  as were the multitude desirous to be under kings as their fathers had been So the senate made a decree that Germanicus should be sent to settle the affairs of the east fortune hereby taking a proper opportunity for depriving him of his life  for when he had been in the east and settled all affairs there his life was taken away by the poison which Piso gave him as hath been related elsewhere  CHAP  This citation is now wanting Chap III ANTIQJJIT1E3 OF THE JEWS S3 â   CH A P III A sedition of the Jews against Pontius Pilate Concerning Christ and what ieftl Paulina and the Jews at Rome J 1 T UT now Pilate the procurator of Judea removed the  army from Cesarea to Jerusalem to take their winter quarters there in order to abolish the Jewish laws So he in troduced Caesar s effigies which were upon the ensigns and brought them into the city  whereas our law forbids us the very making of images on which account the former procurators were wont to make their entry into the city with such ensigns as had not those ornaments Pilate was the first who brought those images to Jerusalem and set them up there  which was done without the knowledge of the people because it was done in the night time  but as soon as they knew it they came in multitudes to Cesarea and interceded with Pilate many days that he would remove the images  and when he would not grant their requests because it would tend to the injury of Caesar while yet they persevered in their request on the sixth day he ordered his soldiers to have their weapons privately while he came and sat upon his judgement seat which seat was so prepa red in the open place of the city that it concealed the army that lay ready to oppress them  and when the Jews petitioned him again he gave a signal to the soldiers to encompass them round and threatened that their punishment should be no less than im mediate death unless they would leave off disturbing him and go their ways home But they threw themselves upon the ground and laid their necks bare and said they would take their death very willingly rather than the wisdom of their laws should be transgressed  upon which Pilate was deeply affected with their firm resolution to keep their laws inviolable and pre sently commanded the images to be carried back from Jerusa lem to Cesarea 2 But Pilate undertook to bring a current of water to Jeru s lem and did it with the sacred money and derived the origin of the stream from the distance of two hundred furlongs How ever the Jews  were not pleased with what had been done a bout  These Jews as they are here called whose blood Pilate shed on this occasion may very well be those very Galilean Jews whose blood Pilate had mingled tuitb their sacrifices Luke xiii i i these tumults being usually excited at some of the Jews great festivals when they slew abundance ot sacrifices and the Galileans being commonly much more busy in such tumults than tho e of Judea and Jerusa lem as we learn from the history

against him and insisted that he should leave off that design Some of them also ussd reproaches and abused the man as crowds of such people usually do So he habited a great number of his soldiers in their habit who carried daggers under their garments and sent them to a place where they might surround them So he bid the Jews himself go away j but they boldly casting reproaches upon him he gave the soldiers that signal which had been beforehand agreed oa  who laid upon them with much greater blows than Pilate had commanded them and equally punished those that were tumul tuous and those that were not nor did they spare them in the least and since the people were unarmed and were caught by men prepared for what they were about there were a great number of them slain by this means and others of them ran away wounded And thus an end was put to this sedition 3 Now there was about this time Jesus a wise man if it be lawful to call him a man for he was a doer of wonderful works a teacher of such men as receive the truth with pleasure He drew over to him both many of the Jews and many of the Gentiles He was the Christ And when Pilate at the sug gestion of the principal men amongst us had condemned hioi to he cross  those that loved him at the first did not forsake him  for he appeared to them alive again the third day f  as the di vine prophets had foretold these and ten thousand other wonder ful things concerning him And the tribe of Christians so iiamed from him are not extinct at this day 4 About the same time also another sad calamity put the Jews into disorder and certain shameful practices happened about the temple of Isis that was at Rome 1 will now first take notice of the wicked attempt about the temple of Isis and will then give an account of the Jewish affairs There was at Rome a woman whose name was Paulina  one who on account of the dignity of her ancestors and by the regular conduct of a vir tuous life had a great reputation  she was also very rich  and although she were of a beautiful countenance and in that flower of her age wherein women are the most gay yet did she lead a life of great inodcstv She was married to Saturninus one that was spel teaches us I jfce xxiii 6 7 that  when Pilate heard of Galilee he asked whether Jesus were a Galilean And as soon as he knew that he belonged to He rocl s jurisdiction he sent him to Herod And ver 12  The same day Pilate and Herod were nude friends together for before they had been at enmity be tween themselves Take the very probable key of this matter in the words of the learned Noldins de Herod No 149  The cause of the enmity between He  rod and Pilate says he seems to have been this that Pilate had intermeddled  with the tetrar ch s jurisdiction and had slain some of his Galilean subjects  Luke xiii i and as he was willing to correct that error he sent Christ to  Herod at this time  A 0 33 April 3 t April 5 Chap III ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 65 was every way answerable to her in an excellent character Decius Mundus fell in love with this woman who was a man very high in the equestrian order  and as she was of toa great dignity to be caught by presents and had already rejected them though they had been sent in great abundance he was still more inflamed with love to her insomuch that he promised to give her two hundred thousand Attic drachmae for one night s lod  ging  and when this would not prevail upon her and he was not able to bear this misfortune in his amours he thought it the best way to famish himself to death for want of food on account of Paulina s sad refusal  and he determined with himself to die after such a manner and he went on with his purpose according ly Now Mundus had a freed woman who had been made free by his father whose name was Ide one skilful in all sorts of mischief This woman was very much grieved at the young man s resolution to kill himself Tor he did not conceal his in tentions to destroy himself from others and came to him and encouraged him by her discourse and made him to hope by some promises she gave him that he might obtain a night s lodging with Paulina  and when he joyfully hearkened to her entreaty she said she wanted no more than fifty thousand drachmae for the entrapping of the woman So when she had encouraged the young man and gotten as much money as she required she did not take the same methods as had been taken before because she perceived that the woman was by no means to be tempted by money but as she knew that she was very much given to the worship of the goddess Isis she devised the following stratagem  She went to some of Isis s priests and upon the strongest assuran ces of concealment she persuaded them by words but chiefly by the offer of money of 25 000 drachmae in hand and as much more when the thing had taken effect and told them the pas sion of the young man and persuaded them to use all means pos sible to beguile the woman So they were drawn in to promise so to do by that large sum of gold they were to have Accord ingly the oldest of them went immediately to Paulina and upon his admittance he desired to speak with her by herself Wheij that was granted him he told her that  he was sent by the god  Anubis who was fallen in love with her and enjoined her to  come to him Upon this she took the message very kindly and valued herself greatly upon this condescension of Anubis and told her husband that she had a message sent her and was to sup and lie with Anubis  so he agreed to her acceptance oÂ the offer as fully satisfied with the chastity of his wife Accord ingly she went to the temple and after she had supped there and it was the hour to go to sleep the priest shut the doors cf the temple when in the holy part of it the lights were also pv t VOL III I  out 6 3 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XVIII out Then did Mundus leap out for he was hidden therein and did not fail of enjoying her who was at his service all the night long as supposing he was the god  and when he was gone away which was before those priests who knew nothing of this stratagem were stirring Paulina came early to her husband and told him how the god Anubis had appeared to her Among her friends also she declared how great a value she put upon this favour who partly disbelieved the thing when they reflect ed on its nature and partly were amazed at it as having no pretence for not believing it when they considered the modesty and the dignity of the person But now on the third day after what had been done Mundus met Paulina and said  Nay  Paulina thou hast saved me two hundred thousand drachmae f which sum thou mightest have added to thy own family  yet  hast thou not failed to be at my service in the manner I invi  ted thee As for the reproaphes thou hast laid upon Mundus  I value not the business of names  but I rejoice in the plea  sure I reaped by what I did while I took to myself the  name of Anubis When he had said this he went his way But now she began to come to the sense of the grossness of what she had done and rent her garments and told her husband of the horrid nature of this wicked contrivance and prayed him not to neglect to assist her in this case So he discovered the fact to the emperor whereupon Tiberius inquired into the matter thoroughly by examining the priests about it and or dered them to be crucified as well as Ide who was the occasion of their perdition and who had contrived the whole matter which was so injurious to the woman He also demolished the temple of Isis and gave order that her statue should be thrown into the river Tiber  while he only banished Mundus but did no more to him because he supposed that what crime he had committed was done out of the passion of love And these were the circumstances which concerned the temple of Isis and the injuries occasioned by her priests I now return to the re lation of what happened about this time to the Jews at Rome as I formerly told you I would 5 There was a man who was a Jew but had been driven a way from his own country by an accusation laid against him for transgressing their laws and by the fear he was under of punish ment for the same  but in all respects a wicked man He then living at Rome professed to instruct men in the wisdom of the laws of Moses He procured also three other men entirely of the same character with himself to be his partners These men persuaded Fulvia a woman of great dignity and one that had   embraced Chap IV ANTIQJJITIES OF THE JEWS 67 embraced the Jewish religion to send purple and gold to the temple at Jerusalem and when they had gotten them they em ployed them for their own uses and spent the money them selves  on which account it was that they at first required it of her Whereupon Tiberius who had been informed of the thing by Saturninus the husband of Fulvia who desired inqui ry might be made about it ordered all the Jews to be banished out of Rome at which time the consuls listed 4000 men out of them and sent them to the island Sardinia  but punished a greater number of them who were unwilling to become soldiers on account of keeping the laws of their forefathers  Thus were these Jews

heathen kings themselves did so those 1 mean who allowed them their rest on the Sabbath day and other soiemn festivals and let them live according to their own laws as Alexander the Great and the Pto lemies of Egypt did It is true they could not always obtain those privileges and then they got excused as well as they could or sometimes absolutely refused to fight which seems to have been the case here as to the major part of the Jews now banished but nothing more See several of the Roman decrees hi their favour as to such matters B XIV ch jt t Since Moses never came himself bc yond Jordan nor particularly to Mount Gerizzim and since these Samaritans have a tradition among them related here by Dr Hudson from Reland who was very skilful in Jewish and Samaritan learning that in the days of Uzzi or Ozzi the high priest i Chron vi 6 the ark and other sacred vessels were by God s command laid up or hidden in Mount Gerizzim it is highly probable that this was the foolish foundation the present Samaritans went upon in the sedition here described and that we Should read here anas instead of MVWIM in the text of Josephus 68 Book XVIII ANTIQJJITIES OF THE JEWS and thought the discourse of the man probable  and as they abode at a certain village which was called Tirathaba they got the rest together to them and desired to go up the mountain in a great multitude together  but Pilate prevented their going up by seizing upon the roads with a great band of horsemen and footmen who fell upon those that were gotten together in the village  and when it came to an action some of them they slew and others of them they put to flight and took a great many alive the principal of which and also the most potent of those that fled away Pilate ordered to be slain 2 But when this tumult was appeased the Samaritan senate sent an embassy to Vitellius a man that had been consul and who was now president of Syria and accused Pilate of the mur der of those that were killed for that they did not go to Tira thaba in order to revolt from the Romans but to escape the violence of Pilate So Vitellius sent Marcellus a friend of hisr to take care of the affairs of Judea and ordered Pilate to go to Rome to answer before the emperor to the accusations of the Jews So Pilate when he had tarried ten years in Judea made haste to Rome and this in obedience to the orders of Vitellius which he durst not contradict but before he could get to Rome Tiberius was dead 3 But Vitellius came into Judea and went up to Jerusa lem  it was at the time of that festival which is called the Pass over Vitellius was there magnificently received and released the inhabitants of Jerusalem from all the taxes upon the fruits that were bought and sold and gave them leave to have the care of the high priest s vestments with all their ornaments and to have them under the custody of the priests in the temple which power they used to have formerly although at this time they were laid up in the tower of Antcnia the citadel so called and that on the occasion following  There was one of the high priests named Hyrcanus and as there were many of that name he was the first of them t this man built a tower near the temple and when he had so done he generally dwelt in it and had these vestments with him  because it was lawful for him alone to put them on and he had them there reposited when he went down into the city and took his ordinary garments the same things were continued to be done by his sons and by their sons after them But when Herod came to be king he rebuilt this tower which was very conveniently situated in a magnificent manner j and because he was a friend to Antonius he called it by the name of Antonia And as he found these vestments lying there he retained them in the same place as believing that while he had them in his custody the people would make no Chap IV ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 69 no innovations against him The like to what HeroJ did was done by his son Archelaus who was made king after him  after whom the Romans when they entered on the government took possession of these vestments of the high priest and had them reposited in a stone chamber under the seal of the priests and of the keepers of the temple the captain of the guard lighting a lamp there every day  and  seven days before a festival they were delivered to them by the captain of the guard when the high priest having purified them and made use of them laid them up again in the same chamber where they had been laid up before and this the very next day after the feast was over This was the practice at the three yearly festivals and on the fast day  but Vitellius put these garments into our own power as in the days of our forefathers and ordered the captain of the guard not to trouble himself to inquire where they were laid or when they were to be used  and this he did as an act of kind ness to oblige the nation to him Besides which he also depri ved Joseph who was also called Caiapbas of the high priest hood and appointed Jonathan the son of Ananus the former high priest to succeed him After which he took his journey back to Antioch 4 Moreover Tiberius sent a letter to Vitellius and com manded him to make a league of friendship with Artabanus the king of Parthia  for while he was his enemy he terrified him because he had taken Armenia away from him lest he should proceed farther and told him he should no otherwise trust him than upon his giving him hostages and especially his fon Artabauus Upon Tiberius s writing thus to Vitellius by the offer of great presents of money he persuaded both the king of Iberia and the king of Albania to make no delay but to fight against Artabanus  and although they would not do it them selves yet did they give the Scythians a passage through their country and opened the Caspian gates to them and brought them upon Artabanus So Armenia was again taken from the Parthi ans and the country of Parthia was filled with war and the prin cipal of their men were slain and all these things were in disorder among them  the king s son also himself fell in these wars together with many ten thousands of his army Vitellius had also sent such greac sums of money to Artabanus s father s kins men and friends that he had almost procured him to be slain by the  This mention of the high priest s sacred garments received seven days be fore a festival and purified in those days against a festival as having been pol luted by being in the custody of heathens in Josephus agrees well with the traditions of Talmudists as Reland here observes Nor is there any question but the three feasts here mentioned were the Passover Pentecost and Feast of Ta bernacles  and the Fust so called by way of distinction as Acts xxvii y wat the great day of expiation TO ANTIQJJITIES OF THE JEWS Book XVIII the means of those bribes which they had taken And when Artabanus perceived that the plot laid against him was not to be avoided because it was laid by the principal men and those a great many in number and that it would certainly take effect when he had estimated the number of those that were truly faithful to him as also of those who were already corrupted but were deceitful in the kindness they professed to him and were likely upon trial to go over to his enemies he made his escape to the upper provinces where he afterwards raised a great army out of the Dabae and Sacae and fought with his enemies and re tained his principality 5 When Tiberius had heard of these things he desired to have a league of friendship made between him and Artabanus and when upon this invitation he received the proposal kindly Ar tabanus and Vitellius went to Euphrates and as a bridge was laid over the river they each of them came with their guards about them and met one another on the midst of the bridge And when they had agreed upon the terms of peace Herod the tetrach erect ed a rich tent on the midst of the passage and made them a feast there Artabanus also not long afterward sent his son Darius as an hostage with many presents among which there was a man seven cubits tall a Jew he was by birth and his name was Elect zar who for his tallness was called a giant After which Vi tellius went to Antioch and Artabanus to Babylon  but Herod Tthe tetrarch being desirous to give Caesar the first information that they had obtained hostages sent posts with letters wherein he had accurately described all the particulars and had left no thing for the consular Vitellius to inform him of But when Vitellius s letters were sent and Caesar had let him know that he was acquainted with the affairs already because Herod had given him an account of them before Vitellius was very much troubled at it and supposing that he had been thereby a greater sufferer than he really was he kept up a secret anger upon this occasion till he could be revenged on him which was after Caius had taken the goverment 6 About this time it was that Philip Herod s brother de parted this life in the twentieth year  of the reign of Tiberius after  This calculation from all Josephus s Greek copies is exactly right i for since Herod died about September in the 4th year before the Christian aera and Ti berius began it is well known Aug 19 A D 14 it is evident that the 37th year of Philip reckoned from his father s death was the 20th of Tiberius or near the end of A D 33 the very year of our Saviour s death also or how ever in the beginning of the next year A D 34 This Philip the tetrarch seems to have been the best ot all the posterity of Herod for his love of peace and his love of justice Chap V ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 71 after he had been tetrarch of Trachonitis and Gaulanitis and of the nation of the Bataneans also thirty seven years He had shewed himself a person of moderation and quietness in the con duct of his life and government he constantly lived in that coun try which was subject to him   he used to make his progress with a few chosen friends his tribunal also on which he sat in judgment followed him in his progress and when any one met him who wanted his assistance he made no delay but had his tribunal set down immediately wheresoever he happened to be and sat down upon it and heard his complaint he there ordered the guilty that were convicted to be punished and absolved those that had been accused unjustly He died at Julias  and when he was carried to that monument which he had already erected tor himself before hand he was buried with great pomp His principality Tiberius took for he left no sons behind him and added it to the province of Syria but gave order that the tri butes which arose from it should be collected and laid up in his tetrarchy CHAP V Herod the tetrarch makes war with Gretas the king of Arabiar and is beaten by him  as also concerning the death of jfohn the Baptist bow Vitellius went up to Jerusalem  together with some account of sigrippa and of the posterity of Herod the Great Â 1 A BOUT this time Aretas the king of Arabia Petrea â and Herod had a quarrel on the account following â Herod the tetrarch had married the daughter of Aretas and had lived with her a great while but when he was once at Rome he lodged with Herod f who was his brother indeed but not by the same mother  for this Herod was the son of the high priest Simon s daughter However he fell in love with Hero dias this last Herod s wife who was the daughter of Aristobu lus their brother and the sister of Agrippa the Great this man ventured to talk to her about a marriage between them which address when she admitted an agreement was made for her to change  An excellent example this t This Herod seems to have had the additional name of Philip as Antipas was named Herod Antipas and as Antipas and Antipater seem to be in a manner the very same name yet were the names of two sons of Herod the Great so might Philip the tetrarch and this Herod Philip be two different sons of the same father all which Grotius observes on Matt xiv 3 Nor was it as 1 agree with Grotius and others of the learned Philip the tetrarch but this Herod Philip Whose wife Herod the tetrarch had married and that in her first husband s life time and when her first husband had issue by her for which adulterous and incestuous marriage John the Baptist justly reproved Herod the tetrarch and for which reproof Salome the daughter of Herodias by her first husband Herod Philip who was still alive occasioned him to be unjus ly beheaded 12 ANTIQJJITIES OF THE JEWS Book XVIII change her habitation and come to him as soon as he should re turn from Rome  one article of this marriage also was this that he should divorce Aretas s daughter So Antipas when he had made this agreement sailed to Rome  but when he had done there the business he went about and was returned again his wife having discovered the agreement he had made with Hero dias and having learned it before he had notice of her knowledge of the whole design she desired him to send her to Macherns which is a place in the borders of the dominions of Aretas and Herod without informing him of any of her intentions Ac cordingly Herod sent her thither as thinking his wife had not perceived any thing  now she had sent a good while before to Macherus which was subject to her father and so all things ne cessary for her journey were made ready for her by the general of Aretas s army  and by that means she soon came into Ara bia under the conduct of the several generals who carried her from one to another successively and she soon came to her father and told him of Herod s intentions So Aretas made this the first occasion of his enmity between him and Herod who had also some quarrel with him about their limits at the country of Gemalitis So they raised armies on both sides and prepared for war and sent their generals to fight instead of themselves  and when they had joined battle all Herod s army was destroyed by the treachery of some fugitives who though they were of the tetrarchy of Philip joined with Herod s army So Herod wrote about these affairs to Tiberius who being very angry at the attempt made by Aretas wrote to Vitellius to make war upon him and either to take him alive and bring him to him in bonds or to kill him and send him his head This was the charge that Tiberius gave to the president of Syria 2 Now some of the Jews thought that the destruction of He rod s army came from God and that very justly as a punish ment of what he did against John that was called the Baptist for Herod slew him who was a good man and commanded the Jews to exercise virtue both as to righteousness towards one another and piety towards God and so to come to baptism for that the washing with water would be acceptable to him if they made use of it not in order to the putting away or the remission of some sins only but for the purification of the body  supposing still that the soul was thoroughly purified be forehand by righteousness Now when many others came in crowds about him for they were greatly moved or pleased by hearing his words Herod who feared lest the great influence John had over the people might put it into his power and incli nation to raise rebellion for they seemed to do any thing he should Chap V ANTIQJJITIES OF THE JEWS should advise thought it best by putting him to death to prevent any mischief he might cause and not bring himself into difficulties by sparing a man who might make him repent of it when it should be too late Accordingly he was sent a prisoner out of Herod s suspicious temper to Macherus the castle I be fore mentioned and was there put to death Now the Jews had an opinion that the destruction of this army was sent as a pu nishment by Herod and a mark of God s displeasure to him 3 So Vitellius prepared to make war with Aretas having with him two legions of armed men  he also took with him all those of light armature and of the horsemen which belonged to them and were drawn out of those kingdoms which were un der the Romans and made haste for Petra and came to Ptole mais But as he was marching very busily and leading his ar my through Judea the principal men met him and desired that he would not thus march through their land  for that the laws of their country would not permit them to overlook those ima ges which were brought into it of which there were a great ma ny in their ensigns  so he was persuailid by what they said and changed that resolution of his which he had before taken in this matter Whereupon he ordered the army to march along the great plain while he himself with Herod the tetrarch and his friends went up to Jerusalem to offer sacrifice to God an ancient festival of the Jews being then just approaching  and when he had been there and been honourably entertained by the multitude of the Jews he made a stay there for three days within which time he deprived Jonathan of the high priesthood and gave it to his brother Theopbilus But when on the fourth day letters came to him which informed him of the death of Tiberius he obliged the multitude to take an oath of fidelity to Caius  he also recall ed his army and made them every one go home and take their winter quarters there since upon the devolution of the empire upon Caius he had not the like authority of making this war which he had before It was also reported that when Aretas heard of the coming of Vitellius to fight him he said upon his consulting the diviners that it was impossible that this army of Vitellius s could enter Petra  for that one of the rulers would die either he that gave orders for the war or he that was marching at the other s desire in order to be subservient to his will or else he against whom this army is prepared So Vitel lius truly retired to Antioch  but Agrippa the son of Aristobu lus went up to Rome a year before the death of Tiberius in order to treat of some affairs with the emperor if he might be ermitted so to do 1 have now a mind to describe Herod and is family how it fared with them partly because it is suitable Vol III K tp 74 Book XVIII ANTIOJJITIES OF THE JEWS to this history to speak of that matter and partly because this thing is a demonstration of the interposition of Providence how a multitude of children is of no advantage no more than any other strength that mankind set their hearts upon besides those acts of piety which are done towards God  for it happened that within the revolution of an hundred years the posterity of He rod which were a great many in number were excepting a few utterly destroyed  One may well apply this for the instrucr tion of mankind and learn thence how unhappy they were  it will also shew us the history of Agrippa who as he was a per son most worthy of admiration so was he from a private man beyond all the expectation of those that knew him advanced to great power and authority I have said something of them for merly but I shall now also speak accurately about them 4 Herod the Great had two daughters by Mariamne the grand daughter of Hyrcanus  the one was Salampsio who was married to Phasaelus her first cousin who was himself the fon of Phasaelus Herod s brother her father making the match  the other was Cypros wfio was herself married also to her first cousin Antipater the son of Salome Herod s sister Phasaelus had five children by Salampsio Antipater Herod and Alexan der and two daughters Alexandra and Cypros which last A grippa the son of Aristobulus married and Timius of Cyprus married Alexandra  he was a man of note but had by her no children Agrippa had by Cypros two sons and three daugh ters which daughters were named Bernice Mariamne and Dru silla  but the names of the sons were Agrippa and Drusus of which Drusus died before he came to the years of puberty  but their father Agrippa was brought up with his other brethren Herod and Aristobulus for these were also the sons of the son of Herod the Great by Bernice  but Bernice was the daughter of Costobarus and of Salome who was Herod s sister Aristo bulus left these infants when he was slain by his father to gether with his brother Alexander as we have already related But when they were arrived at years of puberty this Herod the brother of Agrippa married Mariamne the daughter of Olym pias who was the daughter of Herod the king and of Joseph the son of Joseph who was brother to Herod the king and had by her a son Aristobulus  but Aristobulus the third brother of Agrippa married Jotape the daughter of Sampsigeramus      king  Whether this sudden extinction of almost the entire lineage cf Hercd the Great which was very numerous as we are both here and in the next section inl ormcd was not in pari as a punishment lor the gross incests they were fre quently guilty of in marrying their own nephews and nieces well deserves to be Considered See Levit xviii 6 7 xxi 10 ar d Noidius De Herod No 26 9 o Chap VI ANTIQJJITIES OF THE JEWS 15 king of Emesa   they had a daughter who was deaf whose name also was Jotape  and these hitherto were the children of the male line But Herodias their sister was married to He rod Philip j the son of Herod the Great who was born of Ma riamne the daughter of Simon the high priest who had adaugh ter Salome  after whose birth Herodias took upon her to con found the laws of our country and divorced herself from her husband while he was alive and was married to Herod Anti pas her husband s brother by the father s side  he was tetrarch of Galilee  but her daughter Salome was married to Philip the son of Herod and tetrarch of Tranchonitis and as he died child less Aristobulus the son of Herod the brother of Agrippa married her  they had three sons Herod Agrippa and Aristo buluSj and this was the posterity of Phasaelus and Salampsio But the daughter of Antipater by Cypros was Cypros whom Alexis Selcias the son of Alexas married  they had a daugh ter Cypros  but Herod and Alexander who as we told you were the brothers of Antipater died childless As to Alexan der the son of Herod the king who was slain by his father he had two sons Alexander and Tigranes by the daughter of Ar chelaus king of Cappadocia  Tigranes who was king of Ar menia was accused at Rome and died childless  Alexander had a son of the same name with his brother Tigranes and was sent to take possession of the kingdom of Armenia by Nero  he had a son Alexander who married Jotape f the daughter of Antio chus the king of Commagena  Vespasian made him king of an island m Cicilia But these descendants of Alexander soon after their birth deserted the Jewish religion and went over to that of the Greeks  but for the rest of the daughters of Herod the king it happened that they died childless And as these descendants of Herod whom we have enumerated were in being at the same time that Agrippa the Great took the kingdom and I have now given an account of them it now remains that I relate the seve ral hard fortunes which befel Agrippa and how he got clear of them and was advanced to the greatest height of dignity and powert C H A P VI Of the navigation of king dgrippa to Rome to Tiberius Casar  and bow upon his being accused l y bis own freed man he il as bound bow also be was set at liberty by Cams after Tiler ius s death and was made king of the tetrarchy of Philip  1 A LITTLE before the death of Herod the king Agrip  pa lived at Rome and was generally brought up and K 2 conversed  There are coins still extant of this Emess as Spnnheim informs us  Spanheim also informs us of a coin still extant ol this Jotape daughter of the king of  i6 Book XVIIL ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS conversed with Drusus the Emperor Tiberius s son and con tracted a friendship with Antonia the wife of Drusus the Great who had his mother Bernice in great esteem and was very desi rous of advancing her son Now as Agrippa was by nature magnanimous and generous in the presents he made while his mother was alive this inclination of his mind did not appear that he might be able to avoid her anger for such his extrava gance  but when Bernice was dead and he was left to his own conduct he spent a great deal extravagantly in his daily way of living and a great deal in the immoderate presents he made and those chiefly among Caesar s freed men in order to gain their assistance insomuch that he was in a little time reduced to po verty and could not live at Rome any longer Tiberius also forbade the fiiendsof his deceased son to come into his sight because on seeing them he should be put in mind of his son and his grief would thereby be revived 2 For these reasons he went away from Rome and sailed to Judea but in evil circumstances being dejected with the loss of that money which he once had and because he had not where withal to pay his creditors who were many in number and such as gave him no room for escaping them Whereupon he knew not what to do  so for shame of his present condition he retired to a certain tower at Malatha in Idumea and had thoughts of killing himself but his wife Cypres perceived his intentions and tried all sorts of methods to divest him from his taking such a course  so she sent a letter to his sister Herodias who was now the wife of Herod the tetrarch and let her know Agrip pa s present design and what necessity it was which drove him thereto and desired her as a kinswoman of his to give him her help and to engage her husband to do the same since she saw how she alleviated these her husband s troubles all she could al though she had not the like wealth to do it withal So they sent him and allotted him Tiberias for his habitation and appointed him some income of money for his maintenance and made him a magistrate of that city by way of honour to him Yet did not Herod long continue in that resolution of supporting him though even that support was not sufficient for him for as once they were at a feast at Tyre and in their cups and reproaches were cast upon one another Agrippa thought that was not to be borne while Herod hit him in the teeth with his poverty and with his owing his necessary food to him So he went to Flaccus one that had been consul and had been a very great friend to him at Rome formerly and was now president of Syria 3 Hereupon Flaccus received him kindly and he lived with him Flaccus had also with him there Aristobulus who was indeed Chap VI ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEW3 indeed Agrippa s brother but was at variance with him  yet  did not their enmity to one another hinder the friendship of Flac cus to them both but still they were honourably treated by him However Aristobulus did not abate of his ill will to Agrippa till at length he brought him into ill terms with Flaccus the occasion of bringing on which estrangement was this  The Da mascens were at difference with the Sidonians about their limits and when Flaccus was about to hear the cause between them they understood that Agrippa had a mighty influence upon him  so they desired that he would be of their side and for that favour promised him a great deal of money  so he was zealous in assist ing the Damascens as far as he was able Now Aristobulus had gotten intelligence of this promise of money to him and ac cused him to Flaccus of the same  and when upon a thorough examination of the matter it appeared plainly so to be he re jected Agrippa out of the number of his friends So he was re duced to the utmost necessity and came to Ptolemais  and be cause he knew not where else to get a livelihood he thought to sail to Italy but as he was restrained from so doing by want of money he desired Marsyas who was his freed man to find some melhod for procuring him so much as he wanted for that pur pose by borrowing such a sum of some person or other So Marsyas desired of Peter who was the freed man of Bernice Agrippa s mother and by the right of her testament was be queathed to Antonia to lend so much upon Agrippa s own bond and security  but he accused Agrippa of having defrauded him of certain sums of money and so obliged Marsyas when he made the bond of 20 000 Attic drachma to accept of 2500 drachmae  less than what he desired which the other allowed of because he could not help it Upon the receipt of this money Agrippa came to Anthedon and took shipping and was going to set sail but Herc nnius Capito who was the procurator of Jamnia sent a band of soldiers to demand of him 300 000 drach mae of silver which were by him owing to Caesar s treasury while he was at Rome and so forced him to stay He then pre tended that he would do as he bid him  but when night came on he cut his cables and went off and sailed to Alexandric where he desired Alexander the Alabarch f to send him 200 0co drachmae  but he said he would not lend it to him but would not refuse it to Cypros as greatly astonished at her affection to her  Spanheim observes that we have here an instance of the Atlic quantity of use money which was the eighth part of the original sum or la per cent for such is the proportion of 2500 to 20 coo f The governor of the Jews there 55 ANTIOJJITIES OF THE JEWS Book XVHL her husband and at the other instances of her virtue so she un dertook to repay it Accordingly Alexander paid them five ta lents at Alexandria and promised to pay them the rest of that sum at Dicearchia Puteoli and this he did out of the fear he was in that Agrippa would soon spend it So this Cypros set her husband free and dismissed him to go on with his naviga tion to Italy while she and her children departed for Judea 4 And now Agrippa was come to Puteoii whence he wrote a letter to Tiberius Caesar who then lived at Capreoe and told him that he was come so far in order to wait on him and to pay him a visit and desired that he would give him leave to come over to Caprese  so Tiberius made no difficulty but wrote to him in an obliging way in other respects and withal told him he was glad of his safe return and desired him to come to C preae  and when he was come he did not fail to treat him as kindly as he had promised him in his letter to do But the next day came a letter to Caesar from Herenr ius Capito to inform him that Agrippa had borrowed 300 cc j drachmae and not paid it at the time appointed  but when it was demanded of him he ran away like a fugitive out of the places under his govern ment and put it out of his power to get the money of him When Caesar had read this letter he was much troubled at it and gave order that Agrippa should be excluded from his pre sence until he had paid that debt upon which he was no way daunted at Caesar s anger but entreated Antonia the mother of Germanicus and of Claudius who was afterward Caesar him self to lend him those 300 000 drachmae that he might not be deprived of Tiberius s friendship  so out of regard to the me mory of Bernice his mother for those two women were very familiar with one another and out of regard to his and Clau dius s education together she lent him the money  and upon the payment of this debt there was nothing to hinder Tiberius s friendship to him After this Tiberius Caesar recommended to him his grandson  and ordered that he should always accom pany him when he went abroad But upon Agrippa s kind re ception by Antonia he betook himself to pay his respects to Caius who was her grandson and in very high reputation by reason of the good will they bare his father f Now there was one Thallus a freed man of Caesar of whom he borrowed a million of drachmae and thence repaid Antonia the debt he owed her and by sending the overplus in paying his court to Caius became a person of great authority with him 5 Now as the friendship which Agrippa had for Caius was come to a great height there happened some words to pass be tweed  Tiberius junior f Germanicus Ghap VI ANTIQJJIT1ES OF THE JEWS 9J tween them as they once were in a chariot together concerning Tiberius  Agrippa praying to God for they two sat by themselves  that  Tiberius might soon go off the stage and  leave the government to Caius who was in every respect more  worthy of it  Now Eutychus who was Agrippa s freed man and drove his chariot heard these words and at that time said nothing of them  but when Agrippa accused him of steal ing some garments of his which was certainly true he ran away from him  but when he was caught and brought before Piso who was governor of the city and the man was asked why he ran away  he replied that he had somewhat to say to Cjesar that tended to his security and preservation  so Piso bound him and sent him to Caprepe But Tiberius according to his usual custom kept him still in bonds being a delayer of affairs if ever there was any other king or tyrant that was so  for he did not admit ambassadors quickly and no successors were dispatched away to governors or procurators of the provinces that had been formerly sent unless they were dead  whence it was that he was so negligent in hearing the causes of prisoners insomuch that when he was asked by his friends what was the reason of his delay in such cases  he said That  he delayed to  hear ambassadors lest upon their quick dismission other  ambassadors should be appointed and return upon him  and  so he should bring trouble upon himself in their public recep  tion and dismission  that he permitted those governors who  had been sent once to their government to stay there a great  while out of regard to the subjects that were under them   for that all governors are naturally disposed to get as much  as they can and that those who are not to fix there but to  stay n short time and that at an uncertainty when they shall  be turned out do the more severely hurry themselves on to  fleece the people  but that if their government be long con  tinued to them they are at last satiated with the spoils as  having gotten a vast deal and so become at leYigth less sharp  in their pillaging but that if successors are sent quickly the  poor subjects who are exposed to them as a prey will not be  able to bear the new ones while they shall not have the same  time allowed them wherein their predecessors had filled them  selves and so grew more unconcerned about getting more   and this because they are removed before they have had time  for their oppressions He gave them an example to shew  his meaning NA great number cf flies came about the sore  places of a man that had been wounded  upon which one of f the standers by pitied the man s misfortune and thinking he  was not able to drive those flies away himself was going to  drive so Book XVIIT ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS  drive them away for him  but he prayed him to let them a  lone  the other by way of reply asked him the reason of such  a preposterous proceeding in preventing relief from his pre  sent misery  to which he answered If thou drivest these flies  away thou wilt hurt me worse  for as these are already full  of my blood they do not crowd about me nor pain me so  much as before but are sometimes more remiss while the  fresh ones that come almost famished and find me quite tired  down already will be my destruction For this cause there  fore it is that I am myself careful not to send such new go  vernors perpetually to those my subjects who are already  sufficiently harrassed by many oppressions as may like these  flies farther distress them  and so besides their natural desire  of gain may have this additional incitement to it that they  expect to be suddenly deprived of that pleasure which they  take in it And as a farther attestation to what I say of die dilatory nature of Tiberius I appeal to this his practice itself for although he were emperor twenty two years he sent in all but two procurators to govern the nation of the Jews Gratus and his successor in the government Pilate Nor was he in one way of acting with respect to the Jews and in another with re spect to the rest of his subjects He farther informed them that even in the hearing of the causes of prisoners he made such de lays  because immediate death to those that must be condemned  to die would be an alleviation of their present miseries while Â those wicked wretches have not deserved any such favour   but I do it that by being harassed with the present calamity  they may undergo greater misery 0 On this account it was that Eutychus could not obtain an hearing but was kept still in prison However some time af terward Tiberius came from Capreae to Tusculanum which is about aa hundred furlongs from Rome Agrippa then de sired of Antonia that she would procure an hearing for Euty chus let the matter whereof he accused him prove what it would Now Antonia was greatly esteemed by Tiberius on all accounts from the dignity of her relation to him who had been his bro ther Drusus s wife and from her eminent chastity  for though  she  This high commendation of Antonia for marrying but once given here and supposed elsewhere Anttq B XVII ch xiii sect 4 and this notwithstanding the strongest temptations shews how honourable single marriages were both among the Jews and Romans in the days of Josephus and of the apostles and takes away much of that surprise which the modern Protestants have at those Jaws of the apostles where no widows but those who had been the wives of one husband only are taken into the church list and no bishops priests or dea cons are allowed to marry more than once without leaving oif to officiate as clergyman any longer See Luke ii 36 1 Tim v II u iii 3 13 Tit i 10 Constitut Chap Vt ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 81 she were still a young woman she continued in her widowhood and refused all other matches although Augustus had enjoin ed her to be married to some body else  yet did she all along preserve her reputation free from reproach She had also been the greatest benefactress to Tiberius when there was a very dangerous plot laid against him by Sejanus a mart who had been her husband s friend and who had the great est authority because he was general of the army and when many members of the senate and many of the freed men joined with him and the soldiery was corrupted and the plot was come to a great height Now Sejanus had certainly gain ed his point had not Antonia s boldness been more wisely conducted than Sejanus s malice  forÂ when she had discover ed his designs against Tiberius she wrote him an exact account of the whole and gave the letter to Pallas the most faithful of her servants and sent him to Capreas to Tiberius who when he understood it slew Sejanus and his confederates so that Ti berius who had her in great esteem before now looked upon her with still greater respect and depended upon her in all things So when Tiberius was desired by this Antonia to examine Euty chus he answered  If indeed Eutychus hath falsely accused  Agrippa in what he hath said of him he hath had sufficient  punishment by what I have done to him already  but if upon  examination the accusation appears to be true let Agrippa  have a care lest out of desire of punishing his freed man he  do not rather bring a punishment upon himself Now when Antonia told Agrippa of this he was still much more pressing that the matter might be examined into  so Antonia upon Agrippa s lying hard at her continually to beg his favour took the following opportunity  As Tiberius lay once at his ease upon his sedan and was carried about and Caius her

ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XVIII lay he was brought Then Tiberius asked him what he had to say against a man who had given him his liberty  Upon which he said  O my lord  this Caius and Agrippa with him were  once riding in a chariot when I sat at their feet and among  other discourses that passed Agrippa said to Cains O that the  day would once come when this old fellow will die and  name thee for the governor of the habitable earth  for then  this Tiberius his grand son would bs no hindrance but  would be taken off by thee and that earth would be happy  and I happy also Now Tiberius took these to be truly Agrippa s words and bearing a grudge withal at Agrippa be cause when he had commanded him to pay his respects to Ti berius his grandson and the son of Drusus Agrippa had not paid him that respect but had disobeyed his commands and transferred all their regard to Caius  he said to Macro  Bind  this man But Macro not distinctly knowing which of them it Was whom he bid him bind and not expecting that he would have any such thing done to Agrippa he forbore and eame to ask more distinctly what it was that he said  But when Caesar had gone round the hippodrome he found Agrippa standing  Â For certain said he  Macro this is the man I meant to  have bound and when he still asked  Which of these is to  be bound  he said  Agrippa Upon which Agrippa be took himself to make supplication for himself putting him in mind of his son with whom he was brought up and of Tiberius his grandson whom he had educated  but all to no purpose for they led him about bound even in his purple garments It was also very hot weather and they had but little wine to their meal so that he was very thirsty  he was also in a sort of agony and took this treatment of him heinously as Ire therefore saw one of Caius s slaves whose name Was Tkuumat tus carrying some water in a vessel he desired that he would let him drink  so the servant gave him some water to drink and he drank heartily and said  O thou boy  this service of thine to me will be for thy advantage for if I once get  clear of these my bonds I will soon procure thee thy fre 6  dom of Caius who has not been wanting to minister to me  now I am in bonds in the same manner as when I was in  my former state and dignity Nor did he deceite him in what he promised him but macje him amends for what he had now done  for when afterward Agrippa was come to the king dom he took particular care of Thaumastus and got him his li berty from Caius and made him the steward over his own estate  and when he died he left him to Agrippa his son and to Bernice his daughter to minister to them in the same capacity The Chap VI ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 83 The man also grew eld in that honourable post and therein died But all this happened a good while later  7 Now Agrippa stood in his bonds before the royal palace and leaned on a certain tree for grief with many others who were in bonds alio  and as a certain bird sat upon the tree on which Agrippa leaned the Romans call this bird bulo an owl one of those that were bound a German by nation saw him and asked a soldier what that man in purple was  and when he was informed that his name was Agrippa and that he was by nation a Jew and one of the principal men of that nation he asked leave of the soldier to whom he was bound  to let him come nearer to him to speak with him for that he had a mind to inquire of him about some things relating to his country  which liberty when he had obtained and as he stood near him he said thus to him by an interpreter That this sudden change  of thy condition O young man  is grievous to thee as bring Â ing on thee a manifold and very great adversity  nor wilt  thou believe me when I foretell how thou wilt get clear of  this misery which thou art now under and how divine Pro f vide nee will provide for thee Know therefore and I ap  peal to my own country gods as well as to the gods of this  place who have awarded these bonds to us that all I am  Somg to say about thy concerns shall neither be said for fa  vour nor bribery nor out of an endeavour to make thee chear  ful without cause  for such predictions when they come to  fail make the grief at last and in earnest more bitter than  if the party had never heard of any such thing However  though 1 run the hazard of my own self I think it fit to de  dare to thee the prediction of the gods It cannot be that  thou shouldst long continue in these bonds  but thou wilt  soon be delivered from them and wilt be promoted to the  highest dignity and power and thou wilt be envied by all  those who now pity thy hard fortune  and thou wilt be hap  py till thy death and wilt leave thine happiness to the  children whom thou shalt have But do thou remember  when thou seest this bird again that thou wilt then live but  five days longer This event will be brought to pass by that  God who hath sent this bird hither to be a sign unto thee  And I cannot but think it unjust to conceal from thee what I  foreknow concerning thee that by thy knowing beforehand  what happiness is coming upon thee thou mayest not regard  thy present misfortunes But when this happiness shall ac L 2  tually  Dr Hudson here takes notice out of Sebeca Epistle V that this was the sustom of Tiberius to couple the prisoner and the soldier that guarded him to Jtther in the same chain 84 AN71 111125 OF THE JEWS Book XVIII  tually befal thee do not forget what misery I am in myself  but endeavour to deliver me So when the German had said this he made Agrippa laugh at him as much as he after  wards appeared worthy of admiration But now Antonia took Agrippa s misfortune to heart  however to speak to Tiberius on his behalf she took to be a very difficult thing and indeed quite impracticable as to any hope of success  yet did she pro cure of Macro that the soldiers that kept him should be of a gentle nature and that the centurion who was over them and was to diet with him should be of the same disposition and that he might have leave to bathe himself every day and that his freed men and friends might come to him and that other things that tended to ease him might be indulged him So his friend Silas came in to him and two of his freed men Marsyras and Stechus brought him such sorts of food as he was fond of and indeed took great care of him  they also brought him garments under pretenqe of selling them and when night came on they laid them under him  and the soldiers assisted them as Macro had given them order to do beforehand And this was Agrippa s condition for six months time and in this case were his affairs 8 But for Tiberius upon his return to Capreae he fell sick At first his distemper was but gentle  but as that distemper increased upon him he had small or no hopes of recovery Hereupon he bid Euodus who was that freed man whom he most of all respected to bring the children  to him  for that he wanted to talk to them before he died Now he had at pre sent no sons of his own alive  for Drusus who was his only son was dead  but Drusus s son Tiberius was still living whose additional name was Gemellus  there was also living Caius the son of Germanicus who was the sonf of his brother Dru Sus He was now grown up and had a liberal education and was well improved by it and was in esteem and favour with the people on account of the excellent character of his father Germanicus who had attained the highest honour among the multitude by the firmness of his virtuous behaviour by the easiness and agreeableness of his conversing with the multitude and because the dignity he was in did not hinder his familiarity with them all as if they were his equals  by which behaviour he was not only greatly esteemed by the people and the senate but by every one of those nations that were subject to the Ro mans  some of which were affected when they came to him with the gracefulness of their reception by him and others were  affected  Tiberius his own grandson and Caius his brother Drusus s grandson t So I correct Joseplius s copy which calls Germanicus his brother who WM his brother son Chap VI ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 85 affected in the same manner by the report of the others that had been with him  and upon his death there was a lamentation made by all men not such an one as was to be made in way of flattery to their rulers while they did but counterfeit sorrow but such as was real while every body grieved at his deathr as if they had lost one that was near to diem And truly such had been his easy conversation with men that it turned greatly to the advantage of his son among all and among others the soldiery were so peculiarly affected to him that they reckoned it an eligible thing if need were to die themselves if he might but attain to the government 9 But whe i Tiberius had given order to Euodus to bring the children to him the next day in the morning he prayed to his country gods to shew him a manifest signal which of those children should come to the government being very desirous to leave it to his son s son but still depending upon what God should foreshew concerning them more thanupon his own opi nion and inclination  so he made this to be the omen that the government should be left to him who should come to him first the next day When he had thus resolved within himself he sent to his grandson s tutor and ordered him to bring the child to him early in the morning as supposing that God would per mit him to be made emperor But God proved opposite to his designation  for while Tiberius was thus contriving matters and as soon as it was at all day he bid Euodus to call in that child which should be there ready So he went out and found Cai us before the door for Tiberius was not yet come but staid waiting for his breakfast for Euodus knew nothing of what his lord intended  so he said to Caius  Thy father calls thee and then brought him in As soon as Tiberius saw Caius and not before he reflected on the power of God and how the ability of bestowing the government oa whom he would was entirely taken from him and thence he was not able to establish what he had intended So he greatly lamented that his power of establishing what he had before contrived was taken from him and that his grandson Tiberius was not only to lose the Roman empire by his fatality but his own safety also because his preservatioa would now depend upon such as would be more potent than him self who would think it a thing not to be borne that a kinsman should live with them and so his relation would not be able to protect him  but he would be feared and hated by him who had the supreme authority partly on account of his being next to the empire and partly on account of his perpetually contriving to get the governmenti both in order to preserve himself and to be at the head of affairs also Now Tiberius had been very much given 8 a ANTI 4JJITIES OF THE JEW Book given to astrology  and the calculation of nativities and Jiad jpent his life in the esteem of what predictions had proved true more than those whose profession it was Accordingly when he once saw Galba coming in to him he said to his most intimate friends that  there came in a man that would one day have the  dignify of the Roman empire So that this Tiberius was more addicted to all such sorts of diviners than any other of the Roman emperors because he had found them to have told him truth in his own affairs And indeed he was now in great dis tress upon this accident that had befallen him and was very much grieved at the destruction of his son s son which he foresaw and complained of himself that he should have made use of such a method of divination tef ore hand while it was in his power to haye died without grief by this knowledge of futurity  where as he was now tormented by his foreknowledge of the misfor Ijtme of such as were dearest to him and must die under that tor ment Now although he were disordered at this unexpected re volution of the government to those for whom he did not intend it he spake thus to Caius though unwillingly and against his own inclination   O child 1 although Tiberius be nearer related  to me than thou art I by my own determination and the con  spiring suffrage of the gods do give and put into thy hand  the Roman empire â and I desire thee never to be unmindful  when thou comest to it either of my kindness to thee who set Â thee in so high a dignity or of thy relation to Tiberius But  as thou knowest that I am together with and after the gods Â the procurer of so great happiness to thee so I desire that  thou wilt make me a return for my readiness to assist thee Â and will take care of Tiberius because of his near relation to Â thee Besides which thou art to know that while Tiberius  is alive he will be a security to thee both as to empire and  as to thy own preservation  but if he die that will be but a  prelude to thy own misfortunes  for to be alone under the  weight of such vast affairs is very dangerous  nor will the  gods suffer those actions which are unjustly done contrary to  that law which directs men to act otherwise to go off unpu  rtished This was the speech which Tiberius made which did not persuade Caius to act accordingly although he promised so to do  but when he was settled in the government he took off this Tiberius as was predicted by the other Tiberius  as he was also himself in no long time afterward slain by a secret plot laid against him 10 So when Tiberius had at this time appointed Caius to be his  This is a known thing among the Roman historians and poets that TitÂ TIUS was greatly given to astrology and divination Chap VI ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS T his successor he outlived but a few days and then died after he had held the government twenty two years five months and three days now Caius was the fourth emperor But when the Ro mans understood that Tiberius was dead they rejoiced at the good news but had not courage to believe it j not because they frere unwilling it should be true for they would have given large sums of money that it might be so but because they were afraid that if they had shewed their joy when the news proved false their joy should be openly known and they should be ac cused for it and be thereby undone For this Tiberius had brought a vast number of miseries on the best families of the Romans since he was easily enflamed with passion in all cases and was of such a temper as rendered his anger irrevocable till he had executed the same although he had taken an hatred against men without reason  for he was by nature fierce in afl he sentences he gave and made death the penalty for the lightest offences insomuch that when the Romans heard the rumour about his death gladly they were restrained from the enjoymerit of that pleasure by the dread of such miseries as they foresaw ifrould follow if their hopes proved ill grounded Now Mar 4yas Agrippa sfreed man as soon as he heard of Tiberius s death Came running to tell Agrippa the news  and finding him going Out to the bath he gave him a nod and said in the Hebrew tongue  The lion  is dead  who understanding his meaning and being overjoyed at the news  Nay said he but nil sorts of  thanks and happiness attend thee for this news of thine  only  I wish that what thou sayest may prove true Now the centurion who was set to keep Agrippa when he saw with what haste Marsyascame and what joy Agrippa had from what he said he had a suspicion that his words implied some great innovation of affairs and he asked them about what was said They at first diverted the discourse  but upon his farther pressing Agrippa without more ado told him for he was already become hrs friend  so he joined with him in that pleasure which this news Occasioned because it would be fortunate to Agrippa and made him a supper But as they were feasting and the cnps went about there came one who said That  Tiberius was still alive  and would return to the city in a few days At which news the centurion was exceedingly troubled because he had done what might cost him his life to have treated so joyfully a pri soner  This nam6 of a lion is often given to tyrants especially by the Jews such as Agrippa and probably his freed man Marsyas in effect were Ezek xix I 9 Esth xiv 13 2 Tim iv 17 They are also sometimes compared to or repre sented by wild beasts of which the lion is the principal Dan vii 3 8 Apoc xiii r 2 83 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XVIll soner and this upon the news of the death of Caesar  so he thrust Agrippa from the couch whereon he lay and said  Dost thou  think to cheat me by a lie about the emperor without punish  ment  and shall not thou pay for this thy malicious report  at the price of thine head When he had so said he ordered Agrippa to be bound again for he had loosed him before and kept a severer guard over him than formerly and in that evil condition was Agrippa that night  but the next day the rumour increased in the city and confirmed the news that Tiberius was certainly dead  insomuch that men durst now openly and freely talk about it nay some offered sacrifices on that account Se veral letters also came from Gains one of them to the senate which informed them of the death of Tiberius and of his own entrance on the government another to Piso the governor of the city which told him the same thing He also gave order that A grippa should be removed out of the camp and go to that house where he lived before he was put in prison  so that he was now 1 out of fear as to his own affairs for although he were still in custody yet it was now with ease to his own affairs Now as soon as Caius was come to Rome and had brought Tiberius s dead body with him and had made a sumptuous funeral for him according to the laws of his country he was much disposed to set Agrippa at liberty that very day but Antonia hindered him  not out of any ill will to the prisoner but out of regard to decency in Caius lest that should make men believe that he received the death of Tiberius with pleasure when he loosed one whom he Lad bound immediately However there did not many days pass ere he sent for him to his house and had him shaved and made him change his raiment after which he put his diadem up on his head and appointed him to be king of the tetrarchy of Philip He also gave him the tetrarchy of Lysanias  and changed his iron chain for a golden one of equal weight He also sent Marullus to be procurator of Judea 11 Now in the second year of the reign of Caius Caesar A grippa desired leave to be given him to sail home and settle the affairs of his government and he promised to return again when he had put the rest in order as it ought to be put So upon the emperor s permission he came into his own country and appear ed to them all unexpectedly as a king and thereby demonstrated to the men that saw him the power of fortune when they com pared his former poverty with his present happy affluence  sg some called him an happy man and others could not well be lieve that things were so much changed with him for the better C H A P  Although Caius now promised to give Agrippa the tetrarchy of Lysanias yet was it not actually conferred upon him till the reign of Claudius a we learn Antiq B XIX chap v sect i Gfcap VII ANTIQJJITIES OF THE JEWS 9 CHAP VII How Herod lhe tetrarch was banished  1 DUT Herodias Agrippa s sister who now lived as wife â to that Herod who was tetrarch of Galilee and Perea took this authority of her brother in an envious manner parti cularly when she saw that he had a greater dignity bestowed on him than her husband had  since when he ran away it was be cause he was in a way of dignity and of great good fortune She was therefore grieved and much displeased at so great a mutation of his affairs and chiefly when she saw him marching among the multitude with the usual ensigns of royal authority She was not able to conceal how miserable she was bv reason of the envy she had towards him  but she excited her husband and desired him that he would sail to Rome to court honours equal to his  for she said that  she could not bear to live any  longer while Agrippa the son of that Aristobulus who was  condemned to die by his father one that came to her husband  in such extreme poverty that the necessaries of life were forced to be entirely supplied him day by day  and whsn he  fled away from his creditors by sea he now returned a king   while he was himself the son of a king and while the near  relation he bare to royal authority called upon him to gain  the like dignity he sat still and was contented with a pri  vater life But then Herod although thou wast formerly  not concerned to be in a lower condition than thy father from  whom thou wast derived had been j yet do thou now seek  after the dignity which thy kinsman hath attained to  and do  not thou bear this contempt that a man who admired thy  riches should be in a greater honour than thyself nor suffer  his poverty to shew itself able to purchase greater things than  our abundance  nor do thou esteem it other than a shameful  thing to be inferior to one who the other day lived upon thy charity But let us go to Rome and let us spare no pains  nor expences either of silver or gold since they cannot be kept  for any better use than for the obtaining of a kingdom 2 But for Herod he opposed her request at this time out of the love of ease and having a suspicion of the trouble he should have at Rome  so he tried to instruct her better But the mora shÂ saw him draw back the more she pressed him to it and de Sired him to leave no stone unturned in order to be king and at last she left not off till she engaged him whether he would or not to be of her sentiments because he could no otherwise avoid her importunity So he got all things ready after as sumptuous a VOL III M 00 ANTIQUITIES or THE JEWS Book XVIII manner as he was able and spared for nothing and went up to Rome and took Herodias along with him But Agrippa when he was made Sensible of their intentions and preparations he also prepared to go thither and as soon as they heard they set sail he sent Fortunatus one of his freed mea to Rome to carrv pre sents to the emperory and letters against Herody and to give Caius a particular account of those matters if he should have any op portunity This man followed Herod so quick and had so pros perous a voyage and came so little after Herod that while He rod was with Caius he came himself and delivered his letters for they both sailed to Dicearchiaj and found Caius at Baiae which is itself a little city of Campania at the distance of about five furlongs from Dicearehia There are in that place royal palaces with sumptuous apartments every emperov still endea vouring to out do his predecessor s magnificence  the place also affords warm baths that spring out of the ground of their own accord which are of advantage for the recovery of the health of those that make use of them and besides they minister to men s luxury also Now Caius saluted Herod for he first met with him and then looked upon the letters which Agrippa had seat him and which were written in order to accuse Herod  where in he accused him that he had been in confederacy with Sejanus against Tiberius s government and that he was now confederate with Artabanus the king of Parthia in opposition to the govern ment of Caius  as a demonstration of which he alledged that he had armour sufficient for seventy thousand men ready in his ar moury Caius was moved at this information and asked He rod whether what w s said about the armour was true  and when he confessed there was such armour there for he could not deny the same the truth of it being too notorious Caius took that to be a sitfficient proof of the accusation that he intended to revolt So he took away from him his tetrarchy and gave it by way of addition to Agrippa s kingdom  he also gave Herod s money to Agrippa and by way of punishment awarded him a perpetual banishment and appointed Lyons a city of Gaul to be his place of habitation But when he was informed that Herodias was Agrippa s sister he made her a present of what money was her own and told her that u it was her brother who prevented her  being put under the same calamity with her husband But she made this reply  Thou indeed O emperor  actest after a  magnificent manner and as becomes thyself in what thou of  ferest me  but the kindness which I have for my husband bin  ders me from partaking of the favour of thy gift for it is not  just that I who have been made a partner in his prosperity  should forsake him in his misfortunes Hereupon Gaiiis was angry Chap VIII AN TIQJJITIES OF THE JEWS Â 1 angry at her and sent her with Herod into banishment and gave her estate to Agrippa And thus did God punish Herodias for her envy at her brother and Herod also for giving ear to the vain discourses of a woman Now t aius managed public af fairs with great magnanimity during the first and second year of his reign and behaved himself with such moderation that he gained the good will of the Romans themselves and of his other subjects But in process of time he went beyond the bounds of human nature in his conceit of himself and by reason of the vast ness of his dominions made himself a god and took upon him Â elf to a ct in all things to the reproach of the Deity itself CHAP VIII Concerning  the amlassqge of the Jews to Caius  and Ixw Caius sent Petronius into Syria to make war against the Jew unless they would receive bis statue Â 1  I HERE was now a tumult arisen al Alexandria between the Jewish inhabitants and the Greeks  and three f ambassadors were chosen out of each party that were at variance who came to Caius Now one of these ambassadors from the people of Alexandria was Apion who uttered many blasphemies against the Jews  and among other things that he said he char ged them with neglecting the honours that belonged to Caesar for that while all who were subject to the Roman empire b uilt altars and temples to Caius and in other regards universally received him as they received the gods these Jews alone thought it a dis honourable thing for them to erect statues in honour of him as well as to swear by his name Many of these severe things were said by Apion by which he hoped to provoke Caius to anger at the Jews as he was likely to be  but Philo the principal of the Jewish ambassage a man eminent on all accounts brother to M 2 Alexander Â This is a most remarkable chapter as containing such instances of the in terpocition of Providence as have been always very rare among the other ido latrous nations but of old very many among the pos erify ot Abraham the wor shippers of the time God nor do these seem much inferior to those in the OM Testament which are the more remarkable because among all other follies and vices the Jews were not at this time idolaters and the deliverances here men tioned were done in order to prevent their relapse into that idolatry t Josephus here assures us that the ambassadors from Alexandria to Cains were on each part no more than three in number for the Jews and for the Gen tiles which are but six in all whereas Philo who was the principal ambassa dor from the Jews as Josepnus here confesses as was Apion for the Gentiles viys the Jews ambassadors were themselves no fewer than five towards the end of his legation to Caius which if there be no nrstake in the copies must be Supposed the truth  nor in that case would Josephus have contradicted so au thentic a witness had he sven that account of Philo sÂ which that he ever did Mies not appear 52 ANTIQUITIES OF TJIE JEWS Book XVIII i Alexander  the alabarch and one not unskilful in philosophy WAS ready to betake himself to make his defence against those Accusations  but Cain prohibited him and bid him be gone  ie was also in such a rage that it openly appeared he was about to do them some very great mis qhief So Philo being thus af fronted went out and said to those Jews who were about him that  they should he of good courage since Caius s words in  deed shewed anger at them but in reality had already set God  against himself 2 Hereupon Caius taking it very heinously that he should be thus despised by the Jews alone sent Petronius to the presi dent of Syriaj and successor in the government to ViteHius and gave him order to make an invasion into Judea with a great body of troops and if they would admit of his statue willingly to erect it in the temple of God  but if they were obstinate to conquer them by wnr and then to do it Accordingly Petro nius took the government of Syria and made haste to obey Ce sar s epistle He got together as great a number of auxiliaries as he possibly could and took with him two legions of the Ro man army and came to Ptolemais and there wintered as intend ing to set about the war in the spring He also wrote word to Cams what he had resolved to do who commended him far bis alacrity and ordered him to go on and to make war with them in case they would not obey his commands But there came many ten thousands of the Jews to Petronius to Ptolemais to bfflr their petitions to him that  he would not compel them to  transgress and violate the law of their forefathers  but if said  they thou art entirely resolved to bring this statue and erect  it do thou first kill us and then do what thou hast resolved  on  for while we are alive we cannot permit such things as  are forbidden us to be done by the authority of our legislator  and by our forefathers determination that such prohibitions are  instances of virtue But Petronitis was angry at them and said  If indeed I were myself emperor and were at liberty to follow Â my own inclination and then had designed to act thus these  your words would be justly spoken to me  but now Ccesar hath  sent to me I am under the necessity of being subservient to  his decrees because a disobedience to them will bring upon me  inevitable destruction Then the Jews replied  Since  therefore thou art so disposed O Petronius  that thou wilt not  disobey Caius s epistles neither will we transgress the com  mands  This Alexander the a abarch or governor of the Jews at Alexandria and brother to t hilo is supposed by Bishop Pearson in Act Apost p 41 47 to b J the same with that Alexander who is mentioned by St l uke as of the kindred of the high priests Acts iv 6    VIII ANTIQJJITIES OF THE JEWS 93  mands of our law  and as we depend upon the excellency of  our laws and by the labours of our ancestors have continued  hitherto without suffering them to be transgressed we dare  not by any means suffer ourselves to be so timorous as to V transgress those laws out of the fear of death which God  hath determined are for our advantage  and if we fall into 1 misfortunes we will bear them in order to preserve our  laws as knowing that those who expose themselves to dan  gers have good hope of escaping thern  because God will  stand on our side when out of regard to him we undergo af  ftictior s and sustain the uncertain turns of fortune But if  we should submit to thee we should be greatly reproached for  our cowardice as thereby shewing ourselves ready to trans  gress our law  and we should incur the great anger of God  also who even thyself being judge is superior to Caius 3 When Petvonius aw by their words that their determina tion was hard to be removed and that without a war he should not be able to be subservient to Caius in the dedication of his statue and that there must be a great deal of bloodshed he took his friends and the servants that were about him and hasted to Tiberias as wanting to know in what posture the affairs of the Jews were  and many ten thousands of the Jews met Petronius again when he was come to Tiberias These thought they must run a mighty hazard if they should have a war with the Romans but judged that the transgression of the law was of much greater consequence and made supplication to him that he would by no means reduce them to such distresses nor defile their city with the dedication of the statue Then Petronius said to them  Will you then make war with Caesar without consider â ing his great preparations for war and your own weakness  They replied  We will not by any means make war with him  but still we will die before we see our laws transgressed So they threw themselves down upon their faces and stretched out their throats and said they were ready to be slain  and this they did for forty days together and in the mean time left otf the tilling of their ground and that while the season  of the vear required them to sow it Thus they continued firm in their resolution and proposed to themselves to die willingly rather than to see the dedication of the statue 4 When  What Josephus here and sect 6 relates as done by the Jews Iff are feed tine is in Philo not far off the time wben the corn ifaj life who as Le Clerc notes differ here one from the other This is another indication that Josephus when he wrote this account had not seen Fhilo i LÂ gat ad Caiiun otherwise h would hardly have herein differed from him Â 4 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XVIII 4 When matters were in this state Aristobulus king Agrip pa s brother and Kelcias the Great and the other principal men of that family with them went in unto Petronius and besought him that  since he saw the resolution of the multitude he  would not make any alteration and thereby drive them to  despair but would wrire to Caius that the Jews had an in  superable aversion to the reception of the statue and how  they continued with him and left off the tillage of their â ground  that they were not willing to go to war with him  because they were not able to do it but were ready to die with Â pleasure rather than suffer their laws to be transgressed  and â how upon the lands continuing unsown robberies would  grow up on the inability they would be under of paying their  tributes and that perhaps Caius might be thereby moved to  pity and not order any barbarous action to be done to them  nor think of destroying the nation  that if he continues inflexi  ble in his former opinion to bring a war upon them he may  then set about it himself And thus did Aristobulus and the rest with him supplicate Petronius So Petronius partly on account of the pressing instances which Aristobulus and the nest with him made and because of the great consequence of what they desired and the earnestness wherewith they made their sup plication  partly on account of the firmness of the oppositioa made by ihe Jews which he saw while he thought it an hor rible thing for him to be such a slave to the madness of Caius as to slay so many ten thousand men only because of their religiou disposition towards God and after that to pass his life in expec tation of punishment Petronius I say thought it much better to send to Caius and to let him know how intolerable it was to him to bear the anger he might have against him for not serving Jhim sooner in obedience to his Â pistle for that perhaps he might persuade him  and that if this mad resolution continued he might then begin the war against them nay that in case he should turn his hatred against himself it was fit for virtuous persons even to die for the sake of such vast multitudes of men ACT cordiugly he determined to hearken to the petitioners in this matter 5 He then called the Jews together to Tiberias who came many ten thousands in number  he also olaced that army he now had  This Publius Petronius was after this still president of Syria under Clau rfius and at the desire of Agrippa published a severe decree against the inha bitants of Dora who in a sort of imitation of Caius had set up a statue of Claudius in a Jewish synagogue there This decree is extant B XIX ch vi sect 3 and greatly confirms the present accounts of Josephus as do the other decrees of Claudius relating to the like Jewish affairs B XIX ch T sect 2 3 to Â jrhich I refer the inquisitive reader Chap VIIL ANTIQJJITIES OF THE JEWS 95 had wrth him opposite to them but did not discover his own meaning but the commands of the emperor aud told them That  his wrath would without delay be executed on such as had the courage to disobey what he had commanded and  this immediately  and that it was fit for him who had received  so great a dignity by his grant not to contradict him in anv  thing  yet said he Â I do not think it just to have such a  regard to my own safety and honour as to refuse to sacrifice  them for your preservation who are so many in number and  endeavour to preserve the regard that is due to your law  which as it hath come down to von from your forefathers so  do you esteem it worthy of your utmost contention to preserve  it nor with the supreme assistance and power of God will Â I be so hardy as to suffer your temple to fall into contempt bv  the means of tire imperial authority I will therefore send Â to Cains and let him know what your resolutions are and  will assist your suit as far as I am able that you may not be  exposed to suffer on account of the honest designs you have  proposed to yourselves  and may God be your assistant for  his authority is beyond all the contrivance arid power of men  and may he procure you the preservation of your ancient  laws and may not he be deprived though without your con  sent of his accustomed honours But if Caius be irritated  and turn the violence of his rage upon me I will rather i n  dergo all that danger and that affliction that may come either  oa my body or my soul than see so many of you to perish  while you are acting in so excellent a manner Do you there  fore every one of you go your way about your own occupa  tions and fall to the cultivation of your ground  J will my  self send to Rome and will not refuse to serve you in all  things both by myself and by my friends 6 When Petronius had said this and had dismissed the as sembly of the Jews he desired the principal of them to take care of their husbandry and to speak kindly to the people and en courage them to have good hope of their affairs Thus did be readily bring the multitude to be ehearful again And now did God shew his presence to Petronius and signify to him that he would afford him his assistance in his whole design  for he had no sooner finished the speech that he made to the Jews but God sent  Josephui here uses the Solemn New Tesl ament words â ntixirix and Â Â Â Â Â Â the frttencc and appearance of God for the extraordinary manifestation oi his puw r and providence to Petronius by sending rain in a time of distivba immediate upon the resolution he had raken to preserve the temple unpolluted at thehazard of his own life without any other miraculous appearance at a I in that cas  which well deserves to be taken notice of here and gvtaily illuiira fs several fexts both in the Old and New Testament S AXTIQJJITIES OF THE JEWS Book XVIII sent down great showers of rain contrary to human expectation  for that day was a clear day and gave no sign by the appearance of the sky of any rain  nay the whole year had been subject to a great drought and made men despair of any water from above even when at any time they saw the heavens over cast with clouds  insomuch that when such a great quantity of rain came and that in an unusal manner and without any other expectation of it the Jews hoped that Petronius would by no means fail in his petition for them But as to Petronius he was mightily sur prised when he perceived that God evidently took care of the Jews and gave very plain signs of his appearance and this to such a degree that those that were in earnest much inclined to the contrary had no power left to contradict it This was also among those other particulars which he wrote to Caius which all tended to dissuade him and by all means to entreat him not to make so many ten thousands of these men go distracted  whom if he should slay for without war they would by no means suf fer the laws of their worship to be set aside he would lose the revenue they paid him and would be publicly cursed by them for all future ages Moreover that God who was their gover nor had shewed his power most evidently on their account and that such a power of his as left no room for doubt about it â â And this was the business that Petronius was now engaged in 1 But king Agrippa who now lived at Rome was more and more in the favour of Caius  and when he had once made him a supper and was careful to exceed all other both in expenees and in such preparations as might contribute most to his pleasure  nay it was so far from the ability of others that Caius himself could never equal much less exceed it such care had he taken beforehand to exceed all men and particularly to make all agree able to Ctesar  hereupon Caius admired his understanding and magnificence that he should force himself to do all to please him even beyond such expenees as he could bear and was desirous not to be behind Agrippa in that generosity which he exerted in order to please him So Caius when he had drank wine plentifully and was merrier than ordinary said thus during the feast when Agrippa had drunk to him   I knew before now  f how great a respect thou hast had for me and how great  kindness thou hast shewed me though with those hazards to  thyself which thou underwentest under Tiberius on that a c  count nor hast thou omitted any thing to shew thy good will  towards us even beyond thy ability  whence it would be a  base thing for me to be conquered by thy affection I am  therefore  See the preceding note t This behaviour of Caius to Agrippa is very like that of Herod Antipas his uncle to Herod i its Agrippu s sister about John the Baptist Matt ziv 6â n Ghap V III ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Q f  therefore desirous to make thee amends for every thing in â which I have been formerly deficient for all that I have be Â stowed on thee that may be called my gifts is but little  Every thing that may contribute to thy happiness shall be at  thy service and thM chearfully and so far as my ability will  reach And this was what Caius said to Agrippa thinking he would ask for some large country or the revenues of certain ci ties But although he had prepared before hand what he would ask yet had he not discovered his intentions but made this an swer to Caius immediately That  it was not out of any ex  pectation of gain that he formerly paid his respects to him  contrary to the commands of Tiberius nor did he now do any  thing relating to him out of regard to his own advantage and  in order to receive any thing from him  that the gifts he had  already bestowed upon him were great and beyond the hopes  of even a craving man  for although they may be beneath thy  power who art the donor yet are they greater than my in  clination and dignity who am the receiver And as Cains was astonished at Agrippa s inclinations and still the more pres sed him to make his request for somewhat which he might gra tify him with Agrippa replied  Since thou O my Lord  de  clarest such is thy readiness to grant that I am worthy of thy  gifts I will ask nothing relating to my own felicity  for what  thou hast already bestowed on me has made me excel therein  but I desire somewhat which may rriaki thee glorious for piety  and render the Divinity assistant to thy designs and may be for  an honour to me among those that inquire about it as shewing  that I never once fail of obtaining what I desire of thee  for  my petition is this That thou wilt no longer think of the de  ication of that statue which thou hast ordered to be fet up in  the Jewish temple by Petronius 8 And thus did Agrippa venture to cast the die upon this oc casion so great was the affair in his opinion and in reality though he knew how dangerous a thing it was so to speak  for had not Caius approved of it it had tended to no less than the loss of hL life So Caius who was mightily taken with Agrippa s oblig ing behaviour and on other accounts thinking it a dishonourable thing to be guilty of falsehood before so many witnesses in points wherein he had with such alacrity forced Agrippa to become a petitioner and that it would look as if he had already repented of what he had faid and because he greatly admired Agrippa s virtue in not desiring him at all to augment his own dominion either with larger revenues or other authority but took care of he public tranquillity of the laws and of the Divinity itself lit granted him what he had requested He also wrote thus to Pc  VOL III N tronius 99 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XVIII I tronius  commending him for his assembling his army and theÂ  consulting him about these aiFairs It therefore said he thou  hast already erected my statue let it stand  but if thou hast  not yet dedicated it do not trouble thyself farther about it but  dismiss thy army go back and take care of those affairs which  I sent thee about at first for I have now no occasion for the  erection of that statue Thus I have granted as a favour to  Agrippa a man whom I honour so very greatly that I am not  able to contradict what he would have or what he desired me  to do for him And this was what Caius wrote to Petro nius which was before he received his letter informing him that the Jews were very ready to revolt about the statue and that they seemed resolved to threaten war against the Romans and nothing else When therefore Caius was much displeased that any attempt should be made against his government as he was a slave to base and vicious actions on all occasions and had no re gard to what was virtuous and honourable and against whomso ever he resolved to shew his anger and that for any cause what soever he suffered not himself to be restrained by any admoni tion but thought the indulging his anger to be a real pleasure he wrote thus to Petronius   Seeing thou esteemest the presents  made thee by the Jews to be of greater value than my com  mantis and art grown insolent enough to be subservient to  their pleasure I charge thee to become thy own judge and to  consider what thou art to do now thou art under my displea  sure  for I will make thee an example to the present and to  all future ages that they may not dare to contradict the com  mands of their emperor P This was the epistle which Caius wrote to Petronius but Petronius did not receive it while Caius was alive that ship which carried it sailed so slow that other letters came to Petro nius before this by which he understood that Caius was dead  for God would not forget the dangers Petronius had undertaken on account of the Jews and of his own honour But when he had taken Caius away out of his indignation of what he had so inso lently attempted in assuming to himself divine worship both Rome and all that dominion conspired with Petronius especially those that were of the senatorian order to give Caius his due re ward because he had been unmercifully severe to them  for he died not long after he had written to Petronius that epistle which threatened him with death But as for the occasion of his death and the nature of the plot against him I shall relate them in the progress of this narration Now that epistle which informed Petronius of Caius s death came first and a little afterward came that which commanded him to kill himself with his own hands Whereupon Chap IX ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 99 Whereupon he rejoiced at this coincidence as to the death of Cai ns and admired God s providence who without the least delay and immediately gave him a reward for the regard he had to the temple and the assistance he afforded the Jews for avoiding the dangers they were in And by this means Petronius esca ped that danger of death which he could not foresee CHAP IX What lifel the Jews that were in Babylon on occasion of Asineiii â and Atnleuif two brethren  1 A very sad calamity now befel the Jews that were in Mesopotamia and especially those that dwelt in Baby lonia Inferior it was to none of the calamities which had gone before and came together with a great slaughter of them and that greater than upon any record before  concerning all which 1 shall speak accurately and shall explain the occasions whence these miseries came upon them There was a city in Babylo nia called Neerda  not only a very populous one but one that had a good and a large territory about it and besides its other advantages full of men also It was besides not easily to be assaulted by enemies from the river Euphrates encompassing it nil round and from the walls that were built about it Ihere was also the city Nisibis situate on the same current of the ri ver For which reason the Jews depending on the natural strength of these places deposited in them that half shekel which every one by the custom of our country offers unto God as well as they did other things devoted to him for they made use of these cities as a treasury whence at a proper time they were transmitted to Jerusalem  and many ten thousand men under took the carriage of those donations out of fear of the ravages of the Parthians to whom the Babylonians were then subject Now there were two men Asineus and Anileus of the city Neerda by birth and brethren to one another They were des titute of a father and their mother put them to learn the art of weaving curtains it not being esteemed a disgrace among them for men to be weavers of cloth Now he that taught them that art and was set over them complained that they came too late to their work and punished them with stripes  but they took this just punishment as an affront nnd carried oft all the weapons which were kept in that house which were not a few and went into a certain place where was a partition of the rivers and was a place naturally very fit for the feeding of cattle and for pre serving such fruits as were usually laid up against winter The poorest sort of the young men also resorted to them whom they N 2 armed AVTIQJJITIES OF THE JEWS Book XVIII armed with the weapons they had gotten and became their cap tains  and nothing hindered them from being their leaders into mischief for as soon as they were become invincible and had built them a citadel they sent to such as fed cattle and ordered them to pay them so much tribute out of them as might be suffi cient for their maintenance proposing also that they would be their friends if they would submit to them and that they would defend them from all their other enemies on every side but that they would kill the cattle of those that refused to obey them So they hearkened to their proposals for they could do nothing else and sent them as many sheep as were required of them  where by their forces grew greater and they became lords over all they pleased because they marched suddenly and did them a mischief insomuch that every body who had to do with them chose to pay them respect and they became formidable to such as came to assault them till the report about them came to the ears of the king of Parthia himself 2 But when the governor of Babylonia understood this and had a mind to put a stop to them before they grew greater and before greater mischiefs should arise from them he got together is great an army as he could both of Parthiaus and Babylonians and marched against them thinking to attack them and destroy them before any one should carry them the news that he had got an army together He then encamped at a lake and lay still  but on the next day it was the Sabbath which is among the Jews a day of rest from all sorts of work he supposed that the enemy would not dare to fight him thereon but that he would take them and carry them away prisoners without lighting He therefore proceeded gradually and thought to fall upon them on the sudden Now Asirieus was silting with the rest and their weapons la by them  upon which he said Â Sirs I hear a fteigh  ing of horses not of such as are feeding but such as have  men on their backs I also hear such a noise of their bridles  that 1 am afraid that some enemies are coming upon us to en  compass us round However let somebody go to look about  and make report of what reality there is in the present  state Â of things and may what I have said prove a false alarm And when he had said this some of them Went out to spy out what was the matter and they came again immediately and said to him that neither hast thou been mistaken in telling us what Â our  EjifwroÂ is here and in very many other places of Josepluis immcdtafe ly at bani and is 10 be bo expounded  T hess ii 4 when s me falsely pre tended that St Paul had said cither by word oi mouth or by an epistle or by both tliat r v any of CLrist was immediately at hard for still St Paul did then plam j think that day not very many years future  Chap IX ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 101  our enemies were doing nor will those enemies be injurious  to people any longer We are caught by their intrigues like  brute beasts and there is a large body of cavalry marching  upon us while we are destitute of hands to defend ourselves M withal because we are restrained from doing it by the  prohibition of our law which obliges us to rest on this day But Asineus did not by any means agree with the opinion of his spy as to what was to be done but thought it more agreeable to the law to pluck up their spirits 1 this necessity they were fallen into and break their law by avenging themselves although they should die in the action than by doing nothing to please their enemies in submitting to be slain by them Accordingly he took up his weapons and infused courage into those that were with him to act as courageously as himself So they fell upon their enemies and slew a great many of them because they de spised them and came as to a certain victory and put the rest to flight 3 But when the news of this fight came to the king of Par thia he was surprised at the boldness of these brethren and was desirous to see them and speak with them He therefore sent the most trusty of all his guards to say thus to them  That king Ar  tabanus although he had been unjustly treated by you who  have made an attempt against his government yet hath he more  regard to your courageous behaviour than to the anger he bears  to you and hath sent me to give you his right hand  and secu  rity and he permits you to come to him safely and without any violence upon the road and he wants to have you address  yourselves to him as friends without meaning any guile or  deceit to you He also promises to make you presents and  to pay you those respects which will make an addition of his  power to your courage and thereby be of advantage to you Yet did Asineus himself put off his journey thither but sent his brother Anileus with all such presents as he could procure So he went and was admitted to the king s presence  and when Artabanus saw Anileus coming alone he inquired into the rea son why Asineus avoided to come along with him  and when he understood that he was afraid and staid by the lake he took an oath by the gods of his country that he would do them no harm if they came to him upon the assuranpes he gave them and gave them his right hand f This is of the greatest force there with all these barbarians and affords a firm security to those  The joining of the right hands was esteemed among the Persians and Par thiitis in particular a most inviolable obligation to fidelity as Dr Hudson here observes and refers to the commentary on Justin B XI ch xv lor its confirma tion We often meet with the like use of it in Josephus t See the above note 102 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XVIII those who converse with them  for none of them will deceive you when once they have given you their right hands nor will any one doubt of their fidelity when that is once given even though they were before suspected of injustice When Arra banus had done this he sent away Anileus to persuade his bro ther to come to him Now this the king did because he want ed to curb his own governors of provinces by the courage of these Jewish brethren lest they should make a league with them  for they were ready for a revolt and were disposed to rebel had they been sent on an expedition against them He was also afraid lest when he was engaged in a war in order to subdue those governors of provinces that had revolted the party of Asineus and those in Babylonia should be augmented and either make war upon him when they should hear of that re volt or if they should be disappointed in that case they would not fail of doing farther mischief to him  4 When the king had these intentions he sent away Anileus and Anileus prevailed on his brother to come to the king when he had related to him the king s good will and the oath that he had taken Accordingly they made haste to go to Artabanus who received them when they were come with pleasure and admired Asineus s courage in the actions he had done and this because he was a little man to see to and at first sight appeared contemptible also and such as one might deem a person of no va lue at all He also said to his friends how upon the comparison he shewed his soul to be in all respects superior to his body  and when as they were drinking together he once shewed Asi neus to Abdagases one of the generals of his army and told him his name and described the great courage he was of in war and Abdagases had desired leave to kill him and thereby to inflict on him a punishment for those injuries he had done to the Par thian government the king replied  I will never give thee  leave to kill a man who hath depended on my faith especially  not after I have sent him tny right hand and endeavoured to  gain his belief by oaths made by the gods But if thou beest  a truly warlike man thou standest not in need of my perjury  Go thou then and avenge the Parthian government attack  this man when he is returned back and conquer him by the f forces that are under thy command without my privity Hereupon the king called for Asineus and said to him  It is  time for thee O thou young man  to return home and not f provoke the indignation of my generals in this place any far  ther lest they attempt to murder thee and that without my ap  probation I commit to thee the country of Babylonia in trust M that it may by thy care be preserved free from robbers and  from Chap IX ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 103  from other mischiefs I have kept my faith inviolable to  thee and that not in trifling affairs but in those that concern  ed thy safety and do therefore deserve thou shouldst be kind  to me When he had said this and given Asineus some pre sents he sent him away immediately  who when he was come home built fortresses and became great in a little time and ma naged things with such courage and success as no other person that had no higher a beginning ever did before him Those Parthian governors also who were sent that way paid him great respect and the honour that was paid him by the Babylonians seemed to them too small and beneath his deserts although he were in no small dignity and power there  nay indeed all the affairs of Mesopotamia depended upon him and he more and more flourished in this happy condition of his for fifteen years 5 But as their affairs were in so flourishing a state there sprang up a calamity among them on the following occasion When once they had deviated from that course of virtue where by they had gained so great power they affronted and transgress ed the laws of their forefathers and fell under the dominion of their lusts and pleasures A certain Parthian who came as ge neral of an army into those parts had a wife following him who had a vast reputation for other accomplishments and particular ly was admired above all other women for her beauty  Auileus the brother of Asineus either heard of that her beauty from others or perhaps saw her himself also and so became at once her lover and her enemy  partly because he could not hope to en joy this woman but by obtaining power over her as a captive and partly because he thought he could not conquer his inclina tions for her  as soon therefore as her husband had been decla red an enemy to them and was fallen in the battle the widow of the deceased was married to this her lover However this woman did not come into their house without producing great misfortunes both to Anlleus himself and to Asineus also  but brought great mischiefs upon them on the occasion following Since she was led away captive upon the death of her husband she concealed the images of those gods which were their country gods common to her husband and to herself now it is the cus tom  of that country for all to have the idols they worship in their own houses and to carry them along with them when they go  This custom of the Mesopotamians to carry their household gods along with them wherever they travelled is as old as the days cf Jacob when Kacluiel his wife did the same Gen xxxi 19 3câ 35 nor is it to pass here unobserved what great miseries came on these Jews because they sitfirred one of their leaders to marry an idolatrous wife contrary 10 the law of Moses d which matter see the note on B XIX ch v sect 3 104 ANTiojriTiES or THE JEWS Book XVIII go into a foreign land  agreeably to which custom of theirs she carried her idols with her Now at first she performed her worship to them privately but when she was become Anileus s married wife she worshipped them in her accustomed manner and with the same appointed ceremonies which she used in her former husband s days  upon which their most esteemed friends blamed him at first that he did not act after the manner of the Hebrews nor perform what was agreeable to their laws in mar rying a foreign wife and one that transgressed the accurate ap pointments of their sacrifices and religious ceremonies  that he ought to consider lest by allowing himself in many pleasures of the body he might lose his principality on account of the beau ty of a wife and that high authority which by God s blessing he had arrived at But when they prevailed not at all upon him he slew one of them for whom he had the greatest respect because of the liberty he took with him  who when he was dying out of regard to the laws imprecated a punishment up on his murderer Anileus and upon Asineus also and that all their companions might come to a like end frorn their enemies  upon the two first as the principal actors of this wickedness and upon the rest as those that would not assist him when he suffered in the defence of their laws Now these latter were sorely grie ved yet did they tolerate thefe doings because they remember ed that they had arrived at their present happy state by no other means than their fortitude But when they also heard of the worship of those gods whom the Parthians adore they thought the injury that Anileus offered to their laws was to be borne no longer and a greater number of them came to Asineus and loudly complained of Anileus and told him that  it had been  well that he had of himself seen what was advantageous to them  but that however it was now high time to correct what had  been done amiss before the crime thathad been committed pro  ved the ruin of himself and all the rest of them They added  that the marriage of this woman was made without their con  sent and without a regard to their old laws  and that the  worship which this woman paid to their gods was a reproach Â to the God whom they worshipped Now Asineus was sen  sible of his brother s offence that it had been already the cause of great mischiefs ajid would be so for the time to come  yet did he tolerate the same from the good will he had to so near a relation and forgiving it to him on account that his brother was quite over borne by his wicked inclinations But as more and more still came about him every day and the clamours about it became greater he at length spake to Anileus about these cla taours reproving him for his former actions and desiring him for Chap IX  ANTIQJJITIES OF THE JEWS 105 for the future to leave them off and send the woman back to her relations But nothing was gained by these reproofs  for as the woman perceived what a tumult was made among the people on her account and was afraid for Anileus lest he should come to any harm for his love to her she infused poison into A sineus s food and thereby took him off and was now secure of prevailing when her lover was to be judge of what should be done about her So Anileus took the government upon himself alone and led his army against the villages of Mithridates who was a man of principal authority in Parthia and had married king Arta banus s daughter he also plundered them and among that prev was found much money and many slaves as also a great number of sheep and many other things which when gained make men s condition happy Now when Mithridates who was there at this time heard that his villages were taken he was very much displeased to find that Anileus had first begun to injure him and to affront him in his present dignity when he had not offer ed any injury to him before hand  and he got together the great est body of horsemen he was able and those out of that number which were of an age fit for war and came to fight Anileus  and when he Was arrived at a certain village of his own he lay still there as intending to fight him on the day following because it was the Sabbath the days on which the Jews rest And when Anileus was informed of this by a Syrian stranger of another village who not only gave him an exact account of other cir cumstances but told him where Mithridates would have a feast he took his supper at a proper time and marched by night with an intent of falling upon the Parthians while they were unap prised what they should do so he fell upon them about the fourth watch of the night and some of them he slew while they were asleep and others he put to flight and took Mithridates alive and set him naked upon an ass  which among the Parthians is esteemed the greatest reproach possible And when he had brought him into a wood with such a resolution and his friends desired him to kill Mithridates he soon told them his own mind to the contrary and said that  it was not right to kill a man  who was one of the principal families among the Parthians  and greatly honoured with matching into the royal family j  that so far as they had hitherto gone was tolerable  for al VOL III O   though  This custom in Syria and Mesopotamia of setting men upon an ass by way tof disgrace is still kept up at Damascus in Syria where in order to show their despite against the Christians the Turks will not suffer them to hire horses but asses only when they go abroad to see he country as Mr Maundrell asiures Us p 128 106 ANTIQJJITIES OF THE JEWS Book XVIII  though they had injured Mtthridates yet if they preserved  his life this benefit would be remembered by him to the ad  vantage of those that gave it him  but that if he were once  put to death the king would not be at rest till he had made a Â great slaughter of the Jews that dwelt at Babylon  to whose  safety we ought to have a regard both on account of our re  lation to them and because if any misfortune befal us we have  no other place to retire to since he hath gotten the flower of  their youth under him By this thought and this speech of his made in council he persuaded them to act accordingly  sd Mithridates was let go But when he was got away his wife reproached him that although he was son in law to the king he neglected to avenge himself on those that had injured him while he took no care about it but was contented to have been made a captive by the Jews and to have escaped them  and she bid him  either to go back like a man of courage or else she sware by  the gods of their royal family that she would certainly dissolve Â her marriage with him Upon which partly because he could not bear the daily trouble of her taunts and partly because he was afraid of her insolence lest she should in earnest dissolve her marriage he unwillingly and against his inclinations got together again as great an army as he could and marched along with them as himself thinking it a thing not to be borne any longer that he a Parthian should owe his preservation to the Jews when they had been too hard for him in the war 7 But as soon as Anileus understood that Mithridates was marching with a great army against him he thought it too igno minious a thing to tarry about the lakes and not to take the first opportunity of meeting his enemies and he hoped to have the same success and to beat their enemies as they did before  as also he ventured boldly upon the like attempts Accordingly he led out his army and a great many more joined themselves to that army in order to betake themselves to plunder the people and in order to terrify the enemy again by their numbers But when they had marched ninety furlongs while the road had been through dry and sandy places and about the midst of the day they were become very thirsty  and Mithridates appeared and fell upon them as they were in distress for want of water on which account and on account of the time ot the day they were not able to bear their weapons So Anileus and Lis men were put to an ignominious rout while men in despair were to attack those that were fresh and in good pKght so great slaughter was made and many ten thousand men fell Now Anileus and all that stood iirm about him ran away as fast as they were able into a wood and afforded Mithridates the pleasure of having gained a great Chap IX ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 107 great victory over them But there now came in to Anileus a conflux of bad men who regarded their own lives very little if they might but gain some present ease insomuch that they by thus coming to him compensated the multitude of those that perished in the fight Yet were not these men like to those that fell because they were rash and unexercised in war  however with these he came upon the villages of the Babylonians and a mighty devastation of all things was made there by the injuries that An ileus did them So the Babylonians and those that had already been in the war fentto Neerda to the Jews there and demanded Anileus But although they did not agree to their demands for if they had been willing to deliver him up it was not in their power so to do  yet did they desire to make peace with them To which the other replied that they also wanted to set tle conditions of peace with them and sent men together with the Babylonians who discoursed with Anileus about them But the Babylonians upon taking a view of his situation and having learn ed where Anileus and his men lay fell secretly upon them as they were drunk and fallen asleep and slew all that they caught of them without any fear and killed Anileus himself also 8 The Babylonians were now freed from Anileus s heavy incursions which had been a great restraint to the effects of that hatred they bore to the Jews  for they were almost always at variance by reason of the contrariety of their laws  and which party soever grew boldest before the other they assaulted the other  and at this time in particular it was that upon the ruin of Anileus s party the Babylonians attacked the Jews which made those Jews so vehemently to resent the injuries they re ceived from the Babylonians that being neither able to fight them nor bearing to live with them they went to Seleucia the princi pal city of those parts which was built by Seleucus Nicator It was inhabited by many of the Macedonians but by more of the Grecians  not a few of the Syrians also dwelt there  and thither did the Jews fly and lived there five years without any misfortunes But on the sixth year a pestilence came upon these at Babylon which occasioned new removals of men s habitation out of that city  and because they came to Seleucia it happened that a still heavier calamity came upon them on that account which I am going to relate immediately 9 Now the way of living of the people of Seleucia which were Greeks and Syrians was commonly quarrelsome and full of discords though the Greeks wefe too hard for the Syrians When therefore the Jews were come thither and dwelt among them there arose a sedition and the Syrians were too hard for the other by the assistance of the Jews who are men that despise O 2 dangers JOB ANTIQJJITIES OF THE JEWS Book XVIII dangers and very ready to fight upon any occasion Now when the Greeks had the worst in this sedition and saw that they had but one way of recovering their former authority and that was if they could prevent the agreement between the Jews and the Syrians they every one discoursed with such of the Syrians as were formerly their acquaintance and promised they would be at peace and friendship with them Accordingly they gladly agreed so to do and xvhen this was done by the principal men of both nations they soon agreed to a reconciliation and when they were so agreed they both knew that the great design of such their union would be their common hatred to the Jews According ly they fell upon them and slew about fifty thousand of them  nay the Jews were all destroyed excepting a few who escaped either by the compassion which their friends or neighbours af forded them in order to let them fly away These retired to Ctesiphon a Grecian city and situated aear to Seleucia where the king of Parthia lives in winter every year and where the greatest part of his riches are reposited  but the Jews had here no certain settlement those of Seleucia having little concern for the king s honour Now the whole nation of the Jews were in fear both of the Babylonians and of the Seleucians because all the Syrians that live in those places agreed with the Seleucians in the war against the Jews  so the most of them gathered them selves together and went to Neerda and Nisibis and obtained security there by the strength of those cities  besides which their inhabitants who were a ijreat many were all warlike men And this was the state of the Jews at this time in Babylonia BOOK Chap Â  ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 109 BOOK XIX Containing the interval of three years and a half From the departure of the JEWS out of Babylon to FADUS tbt Roman Procurator CHAP I How Caius  was slain ty Chereas  1 VTOW this Caiusf did not demonstrate his madness in of fering injuries only to the Jews at Jerusalem or to those that dwelt in the neighbourhood but suffered it to extend itself through all the earth and sea so far as was in subjection to the Romans and filled it with ten thousand mischiefs so many indeed in number as no former history relates But Rome it self felt the most dismal effects of what he did while he deemed that not to be anyway more honourable than the rest of the ci ties  but he pulled and hauled its other citizens but especially the senate and particularly the nobility and such as had been dignified by illustrious ancestors  he also had ten thousand de vices against such of the equestrian order as it was styled who were esteemed by the citizens equal in dignity and wealth with the senators because out of themthesenatorswere themselves cho sen  these he treated after an ignominious manner and removed them out of his way while they were at once slain and their wealth plundered because he slew men generally in orderto seize on their riches He also asserted his own divinity and insisted on greater honours to be paid him by his subjects than are due to mankind He also frequented that temple of Jupiter which they style the Capitol which is with them the most holy of all their temples and had boldness enough to call himself the brother of Jupiter And other pranks he did like a madman  as when he laid a bridge from the city Dicearchia which belongs to Cam pania to Misenum another city upon the sea side from one pro montory Â In this and the three next chapters we have I think a large and more dis tinct account of the slaughter of Gains and the succession of Claudius than we have of any such ancient facts whatsoever elsewhere Some of the occasions of which probably were Josephus s bitter hatred against tyranny and the pleasure he took in giving the history of the slaughter of such a barbarous tyrant as was this Caius Caligula as also the deliverance his own nation had by that slaugh ter of which he speaks sect 2 together with the great intimacy he had with Agrippa junior whose father was deeply concerned in the advancement of Clau dius upon the death of Caius from which Agrippa junior Josephus might be fully informed of his history t Called Caligula by the Romans 110 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XIX montory to another of the length of thirty furlongs as measu red over the sea And this was done because he esteemed it to be a most tedious thing to row over it in a small ship and thought withal that it became him to make that bridge since he was lord of the sea and might oblige it to give marks of obedience as well as the earth  so he inclosed the whole bay within his bridge and drove his chariot over it and thought that as he was a god it was fit for him to travel over such roads as this was Nor did he abstain from the plunder of any of the Grecian temples and gave order that all the engravings and sculptures and the rest of the ornaments of the statues and donations therein dedicated should be brought to him saying that  the best things ought  to be set no where but in the best place and that the city of  Rome was that best place He also adorned his own house and his gardens with the curiosities brought from those temples together with the houses he lay at when he travelled all over Italy whence he did not scruple to give a command that the statue of Jupiter Olympius so called because he was honoured at the Olympian games by the Greeks which was the work of Phidias the Athenian should be brought to Rome Yet did not he compass his end because the architects told Memmius Regu lus who was commanded to remove that statue of Jupiter that the workmanship was such as would be spoiled and would not bear the removal It was also reported that Memmius both on that account and on account of some such mighty prodigies as are of an incredible nature put off the taking it down and wrote to Caius those accounts as his apology for not having done what his epistle required of him  and that when he was thence in dan ger of perishing he was saved by Caius being dead himself before he had put him to death 2 Nay Caius s madness came to this height that when he had a daughter born he carried her into the capitol and put her upon the knees of the statue and said that the child was com mon to him and to Jupiter and determined that she had two fa thers but which of these fathers were the greatest he left un determined  and yet mankind bore him in such his pranks He also gave leave to slaves to accuse their masters of any crimes whatsoever they pleased  for all such accusations were terrible because they were in great part made to please him and at his suggestion insomuch that Pallux Claudius s slave had the bold ness to lay an accusation against Claudius himself and Caius was not ashamed to be present at his trial of life and death to hear that trial of his own uncle in hopes of being able to take him off although he did not succeed to his mind But when he had filled the whole habitable world which he governed with false   accusations Chap I Ill ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS accusations and miseries and had occasioned the greatest insult of slaves against their masters who indeed in a great measure ruled them there were many secret plots now laid against him  some in anger and in order for men to revenge themselves on account of the miseries they had already undergone from him  and others made attempts upon him in order to take him off be fore they should fall into such great miseries while his death came very fortunately for the preservation of the laws of all men and had a great influence upon the public welfare  and this hap pened most happily for our nation in particular which had al most utterly perished if he had not been suddenly slain And I confess I have a mind to give a full account of this matter par ticularly because it will afford great assurance of the power of God and great comfort to those that are under afflictions and wise caution to those who think their happiness will never end nor bring them at length to the most lasting miseries if they do not conduct their lives by the principles of virtue 3 Now there were three several conspiracies made in order to take off Caius and each of these three were conducted by ex cellent persons Emilius Regulus born at Corduba in Spain got some men together and was desirous to take Caius off either by them or by himself Another conspiracy there was laid by them under the conduct of Cherea Cassius the tribune of the Pretorian band  Minucianus Annius was also one of great con sequence among those that were prepared to oppose his tyranny Now the several occasions of these men s several hatred and con spiracy against Caius were these  Regulus had indignation and hatred against all injustice for he had a mind naturally angry and bold and free which made him not conceal his counsels  so he communicated them to many of his friends and to others who seemed to him persons of activity and vigour  Minucianus en tered into this conspiracy because of the injustice done to Lepi dus his particular friend and one of the best character of all the citizens whom Caius had slain as also because he was afraid of himself since Caius s wrath tended to the slaughter of all alike  and for Cherea he came in because he thought it a deed worthy of a free ingenious man to kill Caius and was ashamed of the re proaches he lay under from Caius as though he were a coward  as also because he was himself in danger every day from his friendship with him and the observance he paid him These men proposed this attempt to all the rest that were concerned who saw the injuries that were offered them and were desirous that Caius s slaughter might succeed by their mutual assistance of one another and they might themselves escape being killed by the taking off Caius  that perhaps they should gain their point and that it would be an happy thing if they should gain j ju ANTIOJJITIES OF THE JEWS Book XIX it to approve themselves to so many excellent persons as earnest ly wished to be partakers with them in their design for the de Jivery of the city and of the government even at the hazard of their own lives But still Cherea was the most zealous of them all both out of a desire of getting himself the greatest name and also by reason of his access to Caius s presence with less danger because he was tribune and could therefore the more easily kill him 4 Now at this time came on the horse races Circensian games  the view of which games was eagerly desired by the people of Rome  for they come with great alacrity into the hip podrome circus at such times and petition their emperors in great multitudes for wJiat they stand in need of who usually did not think fit to deny them their requests but readily and gratefully granted them Accordingly they most importunate ly desired that Caius would now ease them in their tributes and abate somewhat of the rigour of the taxes imposed upon them  but he would not hear their petition  and when their clamours increased he sent soldiers some one way and some another and gave order that they should lay hold on those that made the cla mours and without any more ado bring them out and put them to death These were Caius s commands and those who were commanded execute the same  and the number of those who were slain on this occasion was very great Now the people saw this and bore it so far that they left off clamouring because they saw with their own eyes that this petition to be relieved as to the payment of theirmoney brought immediate death upon them These things made Cherea more resolute to go on with his plot in order to put an end to this barbarity of Caius against men He then at several times thought to fall upon Caius even as he was feasting  yet did he restrain himself by some considerations  not that he had any doubt on him about killing him but as watching for a proper season that the attempt might not be frus trated but that he might give the blow so as might certainly gain his purpose 5 Cherea had been in the army a long time yet was he not pleased with conversing so much with Caius But Caius had set him to require the tributes and other dues which when not paid in due time were forfeited to Caesar s treasury  and he had made some delays in requiring them because those burdens had been doubled and hath rather indulged his own mild disposition than performed Caius s command nay indeed he provoked Caius to anger by his sparing men and pitying the hard fortunes of those from whom he demanded the taxes and Caius upbraid ed him with his sloth and effeminacy in being so long about col lecting Chap I ANTIQJJITIES OF THE JEWS lectiug the taxes And indeed he did not only affront him in other respects but when he gave him the watch word of the day to whora it was to be given by his place he gave him feminine words and those of a nature very reproachful and these watch words he gave out as having been initiated in the secrets of cer tain mysteries which he had been himself the author of No al though he had sometimes put on women s clothes a d had been wrapt in some embroidered garments to them belonging and done a great many other things in order to make the company mistake him for a woman  yet did he byway of reproach object the like womanish behaviour to Cherea But when Ch ere a re ceived the watch word from him he had indignation at it hut had greater indignation at the delivery of it to others as being laughed at by those that received it insomuch that his fellow tribunes made him the subject of their drollery  for they would foretell that he would bring them some of his useful watch words when he was about to take the watch word from Caesar and would thereby make him ridiculous  on which accounts he took the courage of assuming certain partners to him as having just reasons for his indignation against Caius Now there was one Pompedius a senator and one who had gone through almost all posts in the government but otherwise an Kpicurian and for that reason loved to lead an inactive life Now Timidius an enemy of his had informed Caius that he had used indecent re J proaches against him and he made use of Quintilia for a wit ness to them  a woman she was much beloved by many that fre quented the theatre and particularly by Pompedius on account of her great beauty Now this woman thought it an horrible thing to attest to an accusation that touched the life of her lover which was also a lie Timidius however wanted to have her brought to the torture Caius was irritated at this reproach upon hlm and commanded Cherea without any delay j to torture tÂ uintiliaf as he used to employ Cherea in such bloody matters and those that required the torture because he thought he would do it the more barbarously in order to avoid that imputation of effemina cy which he had laid upon him But Quintilia when she was brought to the rack trod upon the foot of one of her associates and let him know that he might be of good courage and not be afraid of the consequence of her tortures  for that she would bear them with magnanimity Cherea tortured this woman after a cruel manner unwillingly indeed but because he could not help it He then brought her without being in the least moved at what she had suffered into the presence of Cains and that in such a state as was sad to behold  and Caius being somewhat affected with the sight of Quintilia who had her VOL III Â  body  114 ANTIQJJ1TIES OF THE JEWS Book XIX body miserably disordered by the pains she had undergone freed both her and Pompedius of the crime laid to their charge He also gave her money to make her an honourable amends and comfort her for that maiming of her body which she h id suffers ed and for her glorious patience under such unsufferable tor ments 6 This matter sorely grieved Cherea as having been the cause as far as he could or the instrument of those miseries to men which seemed worthy of consolation to Caius himself  on which account he said to Clement and to Papinius of whom Clement was general of the army and Papinius was a tribune  To  be sure Clement we have no way failed in Our guarding the Â emperor  for as to those that have made conspiracies against  his government some have been slain by our care and pains  and some have been by us tortured and this to such a degree  that he hath himself pitied them How great then is our vir  tue in submitting to conduct his armies  Clement held his peace but shewed the shame he was under in obeying Caius s orders both by his eyes and his blushing countenance while he thought it by no means right to accuse the emperor in express words lest their own safety should be endangered thereby Upon which Cherea took courage and spake to him without fear of the dangers that were before him and discoursed largely of the sore calamities under which the city and the government then labour ed and said  We may indeed pretend in words that Caius is  the person unto whom the cause of such miseries ought to be  imputed  but in the opinion of such as are able to judge up  rightly it is I O Clement  and this Papinius and before us Â thou thyself who bring these tortures upon the Romans and  upon all mankind It is not done by our being subservient to Â the commands of Caius but it is done by our own consent Â for whereas it is in our power to put an end to the life of this  man who hath so terribly injured the citizens and his subjects  we are his guard in mischief and his executioners instead of Â his soldiers and are the instruments of his cruelty We bear  these weapons not for our liberty not for the Roman govern  ment but only for his preservation who hath enslaved both  their bodies and their minds  and We are every day polluted Â with the blood that we shed and the torments we inflict upon  others  and this we do till somebody becomes Caius s instru  ment in bringing the like miseries upon ourselves Nor does he Â thus employ us because he hath a kindness for us but rather  because he hath a suspicion of us as also because when abun  dance more have been killed for Caius will set no bounds to Â his wrath since he aims to do all not out of regard to justice  but  I AN17QJJIT1ES Of THE JEWS 115  but to his own pleasure we shall also ourselves be exposed to  his cruelty  whereas we ought to be the means of confirming  the security and liberty of all and at the same time to resolve Â Â to free ourselves from dangers 7 Hereupon Clement openly commended Cherea s intentions but bid him  hold his tongue  for that in case his words  should get out among many and such things should be spread  abroad as were fit to be concealed the plot would come to  be discovered before it was executed and they should be  brought to punishment but that they should leave all to  futurity and the hope which thence arose that some fortunate Â event would come to their assistance  that as for himself his  age would not permit him to make any attempt in that case  However although perhaps I could suggest what may be  safer than what thou Cherea hast contrived and said yet  how is it possible for any one to suggest what is more for  thy reputation  So Clement went his way home with deep reflections on what he had heard and what he had himself said Cherea also was under a concern and went quickly to Cornelius Sabinus who was himself one of the tribunes and whom he otherwise knew to be a worthy man and a lover of liberty and on that account very uneasy at the present manage ment of public affairs he being desirous to come immediately to the execution of what had been determined and thinking it right for him to propose it to the other and afraid lest Clement should discover them and besides looking upon delays and put tings off to be the next to desisting from the enterprise 8 But as all was agreeable to Sabinus who had himself Â qually with Cherea the same design but had been silent for want of a person to whom he could safely communicate that design so having now met with one who not only promised to conceal what he heard but who had already opened his mind to him he was much more encouraged and desired of Cherea that no delay might be made therein Accordingly they went to Minucianus who was as virtuous a man and as zealous to do glorious actions as themselves and suspected by Cains on occasion of the slaughter of Lepidus  for Minucianus and Lepi dus were intimate friends and both in fear of the dangers that they were under for Caius was terrible to all the great men as appearing ready to act a mad part towards each of them in particular and towards all of them in general and these men were afraid of one another while they were yet uneasy at the posture of affairs but avoided to declare their mind and their hatred against Caius to one another out of fear of the dangers fhey might be in thereby although they perceived by other P 2 means 113 Book XIX ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS means their mutual hatred against Cains and on that account were not averse to a mutual kindness one towards another 9 When Minucianus and Cherea had met together and sa luted one another as they had been used in former conversa tions to give the upper hand to Minucianus both on account of his eminent dignity for he was the noblest of all the citizens and highly commended by all men especially when he made speeches to them Minucianus began first and asked Cherea What was the watch word he had received that day from Caius  for the affront which was offered Cherea in giving the watch words was famous over the city But Cherea made no delay so long as to reply to that question out of the joy he had that Minucianus would have such confidence in him as to discourse with him  But do thou faid he  give me the  watch word of liberty And I return thee my thanks that  thou hast so greatly encouraged me to exert myr If after an  extraordinary manner  nor do I stand in need of many words  to encourage me since both thou and I are of the same mind  and partakers of the same resolutions and this before we M have conferred together I have indeed but one sword girt  on but this one will serve us both Come on therefore let us set about the work Do thou go first if thou hast a mind  and bid me follow thee  or else I will go first and thou shalt  assist me and we will assist one another and trust one another  Nor is there a necessity for even one sword to such as have  a mind disposed to such works by which mind the sword uses  to be successful I am zealous about this action nor am I  solicitous what I may myself undergo  for I am not at leisure  to consider the dangers that may come upon myself so deep  ly am I troubled at the slavery our once free country is now  under and at the contempt cast upon our excellent laws and  at the destruction which hangs over all men by the means of  Caius I wish that I may be judged by thee and that thou  mayst esteem me worthy of credit in these matters seeing we  are both of the same opinion and there is herein no difference  between us 10 When Minucianus saw the vehemency with which Che rea delivered himself he gladly embraced him and encouraged him in his bold attempt commending him and embracing him  so he let him go with his good wishes  and some affirm that he thereby confirmed Minuaianus in the prosecution of what had been agreed among them  for as Cherea entered into the court the report runs that a voice came from among the multitude to encourage him which bid him finish what he was about and take the opportunity that providence afforded and that Cherea at first Chap I ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 117 first suspected that some one of the conspirators had betrayed him and he was caught but at length perceived that it was by way of exhortation Whether somebody  that was conscious of what he was about gave a signal for his encouragement or whether it were God himself who looks upon the actions of men that encouraged him to go on boldly in his design is uncer tain The plot was now co mmunicated to a great many and they were all in their armour  sAme of the conspirators being senators and some of the equestrian order and as many of the soldiery as were made acquainted with it for there was not one of them who would not reckdn it a part of his happiness to kill Caius and on that account they were all very zealous in the af fair by what means soever any one could come at it that he might not be behind hand in these virtuous designs but might be ready with all his alacrity or power both by words and ac tions to complete this slaughter of a tyrant And besides these Callistus also who was a freed man of Caius and was the only man that had arrived at the greatest degree of power under him  such a power indeed as was in a manner equal to the power of the tyrant himself by the dread that all men had of him and by the great riches he had acquired  for he took bribes most plen teously and committed injuries without bounds and was more ex travagant in the use df his power in unjust proceedings than any pther He also knew the disposition of Caius to be implacable and never to be turned from what he had resolved on He had withal many other reasons why he thought himself in danger and the vastness of his wealth was not one of the least of them  on which account he privately ingratiated himself with Claudius and transferred his courtship to him out of this hope that in case upon the removal of Caius the government should come to him his interest in such changes should lay a foundation for his preserving his dignity under him since he laid in before hand a stock of merit and did Claudius good offices in his promotion He had also the boldness to pretend that lie had been persuaded to make away Claudius by poisoning him but had still invented ten thousand excuses for delaying to do it But it seems pro bable to me that Callistus only counterfeited this in order to in gratiate himself with Claudius  for if Caius had been in ear nest resolved to take off Claudius he would not have admitted of Callistus s excuses nor would Callistus if he had been en joined to do such an act as was desired by Caius have put it off nor if he had disobeyed those injunctions of his master had he e scaped immediate punishment while Claudius was preserved from   Just such a voice as this is related to be came ami from an unknown ori ginal also to the famous Polycarp as he was going to martyrdom bidding him  play the man  as the church of Smyrna assures us in their account of that his mart rdom sect 9 118 ANTIQJJIT1ES OF THE JEWS Book XIX from the madness of Caius by a certain divine providence and Callistus pretended to such a piece of merit as he no way deserved 11 However the execution of Cherea s designs was put off from day to day by the sloth of many therein concerned  for as to Cherea himself he would hot willingly make any delay in that execution thinking every time a fit time for it for fre quent opportunities offered themselves  as when Caius went up to the capitol to sacrifice for his daughter or when he stood upon his royal palace and threw gold and silver pieces of money among the people he might be pushed down headlong because the top of the palace that looks toward the market place was very high  and also when he celebrated the mysteries which he had appointed at that time  for he was then no way secluded from the people but solicitous to do every thing carefully and decently and was free from all suspicion that he should be then assaulted by any body  and although the gods should afford him no divine assistance to enable him to take away his life yet had he strength himself suflicient to dispatch Caius even without a sword Thus was Cherea angry at his fellow conspirators for fear they should suffer a proper opportunity to pass by  and they were themselves sensiblethathehad just causeto be angry at them and that his eagerness was for his advantage yet did they desire he would have a little longer patience lest upon any disappoint ment they might meet with they should put the city into disorder and an inquisition should be made after the conspiracy and should render the courage of those that were to attack Caius without success while he would then secure himself more carefully than ever against them that it would therefore be the best to set about the work when the shews were exhibited in the palace These shews were acted in honour of that Caesar  who first of all chan ged the popular government and transferred it to himself gal leries being fixed before the palace where the Romans that were Patricians became spectators together with their children and their wives and Caesar himself was to be also a spectator and they reckoned among those many ten thousands who would there be crowded into a narrow compass they should have a favour able opportunity to make their attempt upon him as he came in  because his guards that should protect him if any of them should have a mind to do it would not here be able to give him any assistance 12 Cherea consented to this delay and when the shews were exhibited it was resolved to do the work the first day But for tune which allowed a farther delay to his slaughter was too hard for their foregoing resolution  and as three days of the regular  Here Josephus supposes that it was Augustus and not Julius Caesar who first changed the Roman commonwealth into a monarchy for these shows were ift honour of Augustus as we shall eÂ ra in the next sec ion but one Chap 1 ANTIQJJITIES OF THE JEWS  119 regular times for these shews were now over they had much ado to get the business done on the last day Then Cherea called the conspirators together and spake thus to them  So much time  passed away without e ffect is a reproach to us as delaying to  go through such a virtuous design as we are engaged in  but tc more fatal will this delay prove if we be discovered and the  design be frustrated  for Caius will then become more cruel  in his unjust proceedings Do not we see how long we de  prive all our friends of their liberty and give Caius leave still  to tyrannize over them  while we ought to have procured Â them security for the future and by laying a foundation for  the happiness of others gain to ourselves great admiration and  honour for all time to come Now while the conspirators had nothing tolerable to say by way of contradiction and yet did not quite relish what they were doing but stood silent and asto nished he said farther  O my brave comrades  why do we  make such delays  Do not you see that this is the last day of  these shews and that Caius is about to go to sea  for he is  preparing to sail to Alexandria in order to see Egypt Is it  therefore for your honour to let a man go out of your hands  who is a reproach to mankind and to permit him to go after 1 a pompous manner triumphing both at land at sea  shall  not we be justly ashamed of ourselves if we give leave to  some Egyptian or other who shall think his injuries insuffer M able to free men to kill him  As for myself I will no longer  bear your slow proceedings but will expose myself to the dan  gers of the enterprise this very day and bear chearfully what  soever shall be the consequence of the attempt nor let them  be evet so great will I put them off any longer  for to a wise 1 and courageous man what can be more miserable than that Â while I am alive any one else should kill Caius and deprive  me of the honour of so virtuous an action 13 When Cherea had spoken thus he zealously set about the work and inspired courage into the rest to go on with it and they were all eager to fall to it without farther delay So he was at the palace in the morning with his equestrian sword girt on him  for it was the custom that the tribunes should ask for the watch word with their swords on and this was the day on which Cherea was by custom to receive the watch word  and the multitude were already come to the palace to be soon enough for seeing the shews and that in great crowds and one tumultuously crushing another while Caius was delighted with this eagerness of the multitude  for which reason there was no order observed in the seating men nor was any peculiar place appointed for the senators or for the equestrian order but they 120 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XIX they sat at random men and women together and free men were mixed with the slaves So Caius came out in a solemn manner and offered sacrifice to Augustus Ciesar in whose honour in deed these shews were celebrated Now it happened upon the fall of a certain priest that the garment of Asprenas a senator was filled with blood which made Caius laugh although this was an evident omen to Asprenas for he was slain at the same time with Caius It is also related that Caius was that day contrary to his usual custom so very affable and good natured in his conversation that every one of those that were present were astonished at it After the sacrifice was over Caius be took himself to see the shews and sat down for that purpose as did also the principal of his friends sit near him Now the parts of the theatre were so fastened together as it used to be every year in the manner following  It had two doors the one door led to the open air the other was for going into or going out of the cloisters that those within the theatre might not be there by disturbed  but out of one gallery there went an inward pas sage partly into partitions also which led into another gallery to give room to the combatants and to the musicians to go out as occasion served When the multitude were set down and Cherea with the other tribunes also were set down also and the right corner of the theatre was allotted to Caesar one Va tinius a senator commander of the pretorian band asked of Cluvius one that sat by him and was of consular dignity alsQj  Whether he had heard any thing of news or not  but topk care that nobody should hear what he said  and when Cluvius replied That  he had heard no news  Know then said Vatinius  that the game of the slaughter of tyrants is to b e  played this day But Cluvius replied  O brave comrade r lf hold thy peace lest some other of the Achaians hear thy  tale And as there was abundance of autumnal fritit thrown among the spectators and a great number of birds that were of great value to such as possessed them on account of their rareness Caius was pleased with the birds fighting for the fruits and with the violence wherewith the spectators seized upon them  and here he perceived two prodigies that happened there  for an actor was introduced by whom a leader of rob bers was crucified and the pantomime brought in a play called Cinyras wherein he himself was to be slain as well as his daughter Myrrha and wherein a great deal of fictitious blood was shed both about him that was crucified and also about Cinyras It is also confessed that this was the same day where in Pausanias a friend of Philip the son of Amyntas who was king of Macedonia slew him as he was entering into the theatre And Chap I ANTIQJJITIES OF THE JEWS 121 And now Gaius was in a doubt whether he should tarry to the end of the shews because it was the last day or whether he should not go first to the bath and to dinner and then return and sit down as before Hereupon Minucianus who sat over Caius and was afraid that the opportunity should fail them got up because he saw Cherea was already gone out and made haste out to confirm him in his resolution  but Gaius took hold of his garment in an obliging way and said to him  O brave K man  whither art thou going  Whereupon out of reverence to Caesar as it seemed he sat down again 5 but his fear prevail ed over him and in a little time he got up again and then Caius did no way oppose his going out as thinking that he went out to perform some necessities of nature And Asprenas who was one of the confederates persuaded Caius to go out to the bath and to dinner and then to come in again as desirous that what had been resolved on misrht be brought to a conclusion im O O  mediately 14 So Cherea s associates placed themselves in order as the time would permit them and they were obliged to labour hard that the place which was appointed them should not be left by them  but they had an indignation at the tediousness of the de lays and that what they were about should be put off any longer for it was already about the ninth  hour of the day  and Cherea upon Caius s tarrying so long had a great mind to go in and fall upon him in his seat although he foresaw that this could not be done without much bloodshed both of the senators and of those of the equestrian order that were present  and al though he knew this must happen yet had he a great mind to do so as thinking it a right thing to procure security and free dom to all at the expence of such as might perish at the same time And as they were just going back into the entrance to the theatre word was brought them that Caius was arisen whereby a tumult was made  hereupon the conspirators thrust away the crowd under pretence as if Caius was angry at them but in reality as desirous to have a quiet place that should have none in it to defend him while they set about Caius s slaughter Now Claudius his uncle was gone out before and Marcus Vi nitius his sister s husband as also Valerius of Asia  whom though they had such a mind to put out of their places the re verence to their dignity hindered them so to do  then followed Caius with Paulus Arruntius  and because Caius was now got ten within the palace he left the direct road along which those his servants stood that were in waiting and by which road Clau VOL III Â  dius Â Suetonius says Caius was slain about the seventh hour of the dÂ y Josephus atom the ninth The series of the narration favours Josephus liJ2 ANTIQJJITIES OF THE JEWS Book XIX dius had gone out before Cains turned aside into a private narrow passage in order to go to the place for bathing as also in order to take a view of the boys that came out of Asia who were sent thence partly to sing hymns in these mysteries which were now celebrated and partly to dance in the pyrric way of dancing upon the theatres So Cherea met him and asked him for the watch word  upon Caius s giving him one of his ridiculous words he immediately reproached him and drew his sword and gave him a terrible stroke with it yet was not this stroke mor tal And although there be those that say it was so contrived on purpose by Cherea that Caius should not be killed at one blow but should be punished more severely by a multitude of wounds yet does this story appear to me incredible  because the fear men are under in such actions does not allow them to use their reason And if Cherea was of that mind I esteem him the greatest of all fools in pleasing himself in his spite against Caius rather than immediately procuring safety to himself and to his confederates from the dangers they were in  because there might many things still happen for helping Caius s escape if he had not already given up the ghost for certainly Cherea would have regard not so much to the punishment of Caius as to the affliction himself and his friends were in while it was in his power after such success to keep silent and to escape the wrath of Caius s defenders and not leave it to uncertainty whether he should gain the end he aimed at or not and after an unreasonable manner to act as if he had a mind to ruin himself and lose the opportunity that lay before him  but every body may guess as he pleases about this matter However Caius was staggered with the pain that blow gave him  for the stroke of the sword falling in the middle between the shoulder and the neck washin tlered by the first bone of the breabt from proceeding any farther Nor did he either cry out in such astonishment was he nor did he call out for any of his friends  whether it were that he had no confidence in them or that his mind was otherwise disordered but he groaned under the pain he endured and presently went for ward and fled  when Cornelius SabinuÂ who was already prepared in mind so to do thrust him down upon his knee where many of them stood round about him and struck him with their swords and they cried out and encouraged one another all at once to strike him Ejgain but all agree that Aquila gave him the finishing stroke which directly killed him But one may justly ascribe this act to Cherea  for although many concurred in the act itself yet was he the first contriver of it and began long before all the rest to prepare for it and was the first man that boldly spake of it to the rest and upon their admission of what â he Chap I ANTIQJJITIES OF THE JEWS 123 he said about it he got the dispersed conspirators together he prepared every thing after a prudent manner and by suggesting good advice shewed himself far superior to the rest and made obliging speeches to them insomuch that he even compelled them all to go on who otherwise had not courage enough for that pur pose  and when opportunity served to use his sword in hand he appeared first of all ready so to do and gave the first blow in this virtuous slaughter  he also brought Caius easily into the power of the rest and almost killed him himself insomuch that it is but just to ascribe all that the rest did to the advice and â bravery and labours of the hands of Cherea 15 Thus did Caius come to his end and lay dead by the many wounds which had been given him Now Cherea and his associates upon Caius s slaughter saw that it was impos sible for them to save themselves if they should all go the same way partly on account of the astonishment they we re under  for it was no small danger they had incurred by killing an em peror who was honoured and loved by the madness of the people especially when the soldiers were likely to make a bloody inquiry after his murderers f The passages also were narrow wherein the work was done which were also crowded with a great multitude of Csius s attendants and of such of the soldiers as were of the emperor s guard that day  whence it was that they went by other ways and came to the house of Germani cus the father of Caius whom they had now killed which house adjoined to the palace  for while the edifice was one it was built in its several parts by those particular persons who had been emperors and those parts bare the names of those that built them or the name 01 him who had begun to build any of its parts So they got away from ttie insults of the multitude and then were for the present out of danger that is so long as the misfortune which had overtaken the emperor was not known The Germans were the first that perceived that Cams was slain These Germans were Caius s guard and carried the name of the country whence they were chosen and composed the Celtic le gion The men of that country are naturally passionate which is commonly the temper of some other of the barbarous nations also as being not used to consider much about what they do  they are of robust bodies and fall upon their enemies as soon as ever they are attacked by them  and which way soever they go they perform great exploits When therefore these German guards understood that Caius was slain they were very sorry for it because they did not use their reason in judging about public affairs but measured all by the advantages themselves re teived Ca us being beloved by them because of the money he 124 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XIX gave them by which he had purchased their kindness to him  so they drew their swords and Sabinus led them on He was one of the tribunes not by the means of the virtuous actions of his progenitors for he had been a gladiator but he had obtained that post in the army by his having a robust body So these Germans marched along the houses in quest of Cassar s murder ers and cut Asprenas to pieces because he was the first man they fell upon and whose garment it was that the blood of the sacri fices stained as 1 have said already and which foretold that this his meeting the soldiers would not be for his good Then did Norbanus meet them who was one of the principal nobility of the cfty and could shew many generals of armies among his an cestors  but they paid no regard to his dignity  yet was he of such great strength that he wrested the sword of the first of those that assaulted him out of his hands and appeared plainly not to be willing to die without a struggle for his life until he Was sur rounded by a great number of assailants and died by the multi tude of the wounds which they gave him The third man was Anteius a senator and a few others with him He did not meet with these Germans by chance as the rest did before but came to shew his hatred to Caius and because he loved to see Caius lie dead with his own eyes and took a pleasure in that fight for Caius had banished Antcius s father who was of the same name with himself and being not satisfied with that he sent out his soldiers and slew him so he was come to rejoice at the sight of him now he was dead But as the house was now all in a tumult when he was aiming to hide himself he could not escape that accurate search which the Germans made while they barbarously slew those that were guilty and those that were not guilty and this equally also And thus were these three persons slain  10 Bnt when the rumour that Caius was slain reached the theatre they were astonished at it and could not believe it  even some that entertained his destruction with great pleasure and were more desirous of its happening than almost any other satisfaction that could come to them were under such a fear that they could not believe it There were also those who greatly distrusted it because they were unwilling that any such thing should come to Caius nor could believe it though it were ever so true because they thought no man could possibly have so much power as to kill Caius These were the women and the children and the slaves and some of the soldiery This last sort hud taken his pay and in a manner tyrannized with him and h id abused the best of his citizens in being subservient to his unjust commands in order to gaiu honours and advantages to Chap I AVTIQJJITIES OF THE JEWS  125 to themselves but for the women and the youth they had been inveigled with shews and the fightings of the gladiators and certain distributions of flesh meat among them which things in pretence were designed for the pleasing of the multitude but in reality to satiate the barbarous cruelty and madness of Caius The slaves also were sorry because they were by Caius allow ed to accuse and t9 despise their masters and they could have recourse to his assistance when they had unjustly affronted them  for he was very easy in believing them against their masters even when they accused them falsely and if they would discover what money their masters had they might soon obtain both riches and liberty as the rewards of their accusa tions because the reward of these informers was the eighth  part of the criminal s substance As to the nobles although the report appeared credible to some of them either because they knew of the plot before hand or because they wished it might be true  however they concealed not only the joy they had at the relation of ir but that they had heard any thing at all about it These last acted so out of the fear they had that if the report proved false they should be punished for having so soon let men know their minds But those that knew Caius was dead because they were partners with the conspirators they concealed all still more cautiously as not knowing one ano ther s minds and fearing lest they should speak of it to some of those to whom the continuance of tyranny was advantageous  and if Caius should prove to be alive they might be informed against and punished And another report went about that al though Caius had been wounded indeed yet was not he dead but alive still and under the physician s hands Nor was any one looked upon by another as faithful enough to be trusted and to whom any one would open his mind  for he was either a friend to Caius and therefore suspected to favour his tyranny or he was one that hated him who therefore might be suspect ed to deserve the less credit because of his ill will to him â Nay it was said by some and this indeed it was that depri ved the nobility of their hopes and made them sad that Cai us was in a condition to despise the dangers he had been in and took no care of healing his wounds but was gotten away into the market place and bloody as he was was making an ha rangue to the people And these were the conjectural reports of those that were so unreasonable as to endeavour to raise lu rnults which they turned different ways according to ihe opi nions of the hearers Yet did they not leave their seats for fear  The rewards proposed by the Roman laws to informers was sometimes an eighth part of the criminal s goodi as here and sometimes a fourth part as Spanheim assures us from Suetonius and Tacitus 326 ANTIQJJITIES OF THE JEWS Book XIX fear of being accused if they should go out before the rest for they should not be sentenced according to the real intention with which they went out but according to the supposals of the accusers and of the judges 17 But now a multitude of Germans had surrounded the theatre with their swords drawn  all the spectators looked for nothing but death and at every one s coming in a fear seized upon them as if they were to be cut in pieces immediately  and in great distress they were as neither having courage enough to go out of the theatre nor believing themselves safe from dangers if they tarried there And when the Germans came upon them die cry was so great that the theatre rang again with the entrea ties of the spectators to the soldiers pleading that they were en tirely ignorant of every thing that related to such seditious con trivances and that if there were any sedition raised they knew nothing of it they therefore begged that they would spare them and not punish those that had not the least hand in such bold crimes as belonged to other persons while they neglected to search after such as had really done whatsoever it be that hath been done Thus did these people appeal to God and deplore their infelicity with shedding of tears and beating their faces and said every thing that the most imminent danger and the ut most concern for their lives could dictate to them This brake the fury of the soldiers and made them repent of what they minded to do to the spectators which Would have been the greatest instance of cruelty And so it appeared to even these savages when they had once fixed the heads of those that were slain with Asprenas upon the altar  at which sight the specta tors were sorely afflicted both upon the consideration of the dig nity of the persons and out of a commiseration of their suf ferings  nay indeed they were almost in as great disorder at the prospect of the danger themselves were in seeing it was still uncertain whether they should entirely escape the like calamity Whence it was that such as thoroughly and justly hated Caius could yet no way enjoy the pleasure of his death because they were themselves in jeopardy of perishing together with him  nor had they hitherto any firm assurance of surviving 18 There was at this time one Euaristus Arruntius a pub lic crier in the market and therefore of a strong and audible voice who vied in wealth with the richest of the Romans and was able to do what he pleased in the city both then and after ward This man put himself into the most mournful habit he could although he had a greater hatred against Caius than any one else his fear and his wise contrivance to gain his safety taught him so to do and prevailed over his present pleasure  so Chap I ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 127 he put on such a mournful dress as be would have done had he lost his dearest friends in the world  this man came into the thea tre and informed them of the death of Caius and by this means put an end to that state of ignorance the men had been in Ar runtius also went round about the pillarSi and called out to the Germans as did the tribunes with him bidding them put up their swords and telling them that Cams was dead And this proclamation it was plainly which saved those that were collect ed together in the theatre and all the rest who any way met the Germans for while they had hopes that Caius had still any breath in him they abstained from no sort of mischief  and such an abundant kindness they still had for Caius that they would willingly have prevented the plot against him and procured his escape from so sad a misfortune at the expcnce of their own lives But they now left off the warm zeal they had to punish his enemies now they were fully satisfied that Caius was dead because it was now in vain for them to shew their zeal and kind ness to him when he that should reward them was perished They were also afraid that they should be punched by the senate if they should go on in doing such injuries that is in case the au thority of the supreme governor should revert to them And thus at length a stop was put though not without difficulty to that rage which possessed the Germans on account of Caius s death 19 But Cherca was so much afraid for Minucianus lest he should light upon the Germans now they were in their fury that he went and spake to every one of the soldiers and prayed them to take care of his preservation and made himself great in quiry about him lest he should have been slain And for Cle ment he let Minucianus go when he was brought to him and with many other of the senators affirmed the action was right and commended the virtue of those that contrived it and had courage enough to execute it and said that  tyrants do indeed  please themselves and look big for a while upon having the  power to act unjustly  but do not however go happily out of  the world because they are hated by the virtuous  and that  Caius together with all his unhappiness was become a con spirator against himself before these other men who attacked  him did so  and by becoming intolerable in setting aside thfc  wise provision the laws had made taught his dearest friends  to treat him as an enemy  insomuch that although in com  mon discourse thess conspirators were those that slew Caius  yet that in reality he lies now dead as perishing by his own  self       20 Now by this lime the people in the theatre were arisen from 128 AXTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XIX f from their seats and those that were within made a very great disturbance  the cause of which was this that the spectators were too hasty in getting away There was also one Alcyon a physician who hurried away as if to cure those that were wound ed and under that pretence he sent those that were with him to fetch what things were necessary for the healing of those wound ed persons but in reality to get them clear of the present dan gers they were in Now the senate during this interval had met and the people also assembled together in the accustomed form and were both employed in searching after the murderers of Caius The people did it very zealously but the senate in ap pearance only  for there was present Valerius of Asia one that had been consul  this man went to the people as they were in disorder and very uneasy that they could not yet discover who they were that murdered the emperor  he was then earnestly asked by them all  Who it was that had done it  He replied  I wish Ihad been the man The consuls  also published an edict wherein they accused Caius and gave order to the people then got together and to the soldiers to go home and gave the people hopes of the abatement of the oppressions they lay under  and promised the soldiers if they lay quiet as they used to do and would not go abroad to do mischief unjustly that they would bestow rewards upon them  for there was reason to fear lest the city might suffer harm by their wild and ungovernable behaviour if they should once betake themselves to spoil the citizens or plunder the temples And now the whole multitude of the senators were assembled together and especially those that had conspired to take away the life of Caius who put on at this time an air of great assurance

by  the relations of others but as to our later state during my  life time I have known it by experience and learned thereby  what mischiefs tyrannies have brought upon this common  wealth discouraging all virtue and depriving persons of mag  nanimity of their liberty and proving the teachers of flattery  and slavish fear because it leaves the public administration not  to be governed by wise laws but by the humour of those that  govern For since Julius Caesar took it into his head to dissolve rt our democracy and by overbearing the regular system of our  laws to bring disorders into our administration and to get  above right and justice and to be a slave to his own inclina  tions there is no kind of misery but what hath tended to Â the subversion of this city  while all those that have succeed  ed him have striven one with another to overthrow the ancient Â laws of their country and have left it destitute of sueh citizens  as were of generous principles because they thought it tend  ed to their safety to have vicious men to converse withal and  not only tp break the spirits of those that were best esteemed  for their virtue but to resolve upon their utter destruction  Of all which emperors who have been many in number and  who laid upon us insufferable hardships during the times of  their government this Caius who hath been slain to day Â hath brought more terrible calamities upon us than did all  the rest not only by exercising his ungoverned rage upon his  fellow citizens but also upon his kindred and friends and a  like upon all others and by inflicting still greater miseries up  on them as punishments which they never deserved he being  equally furious against men and against the gods For ty  rants are not content to gain their sweet pleasure and this by  acting injuriously and in the vexation they bring both upon  men s estates and their wives  but they look upon that to â be their principal advantage when they can utterly overthrow Â the entire families of their enemies  while all lovers of li  berty are the enemies of tyranny Nor can those that pa  tiently endure what miseries they bring on them gain their  friendship  for as they are conscious of the abundant mis  chiefs they have brought on these men and how magnani  mously they have borne their hard fortunes they cannot  but be sensible what evils they have done

or on the  contrary they may declare their dissent to such things as  have been proposed and this without any hazard of danger to  come upon them  because they have now no lord set over  them who without fear of punishment could do mischief to  the city and had an uncontroulable porwer to ta Tte off those  that freely declared their opinions Nor has any thing so  much contributed to this increase of tyranny of late as sloth  and a timorous forbearance of contradicting the emperor s  will while men had an over great inclination to the sweet  ness of peace and had learned to live like slaves and as many  of us as either heard of intolerable calamities that happened â at a distance from us or saw the miseries that were near us  out of the dread of dying virtuously endured a death joined  with the utmost infamy V e ought t hen in the first place  to decree the greatest honours we are able to those that have  taken off the tyrant especially to Cherea Cassius  for this  one man

tyranny took counsel before hand  and before hand hazarded himself for our liberties  but ought  to decree him proper honours and thereby freely declare that  he from the beginning acted with our approbation And cer  tainly it is a very excellent thing and what becomes freemen  to requite their benefactors as this man hath been a benefac  tor to us a1 though not at all like Cassius and Brutus who  slew Caius Julius Caesar  for those men laid the foundations Â of sedition and civil wars in our city but this man together  with his slaughter of the tyrant hath set our city free from all

Caius engraven upon it and which in his zeal in speaking and his earnestness in doing what he was about as it was supposed he had forgotten to take off himself This sculpture was broken immediately But as it was now far in the night Che rea demanded of the consuls the watch word who gave him this word Liberty These facts were the subjects of admiration to themselves and almost incredible  for it was an hundred years  since the der mocracy had been laid aside when this giving the watch word returned to the consuls  for before the city was subject to ty rants they were the commanders of the soldiers But when Cherea had received hat watch word he delivered it to those who were on the senate s side which were four regiments who esteemed the government without emperors to be preferable to tyranny So these went away with their tribunes The people also now departed very joyful full of hope and of coni rage as having recovered their former democracy and were na longer under an emperor  and Cherea was in very great esteem with them 4 And now Cherea was very uneasy that Caius s daughtec and wife were still alive and that all his family did not perish with him since whosoever was left of them must be left for the ruin of the city and of the laws Moreover in order to finish this matter with the utmost zeal and in order to satisfy his ha tred of Caius he sent Julius Lupus one of the tribunes to kill Caius s wife and daughter They proposed this office to Lu pus as to a kinsman of Clement that he might be so far a par taker of this murder of the tyrant and might rejoice in the vir tue of having assisted his fellow citizens and that he might ap pear to have been a partaker with those that were first in their designs against him  Yet did this action appear to some of the conspirators to be too cruel as to this using such severity to a woman because Caius did more indulge his own ill nature than use her advice in all that he did  from which ill nature it was that the city was in sp desperate a condition with the miseries that were brought on it and the flower of the city was destroy ed But others accused her of giving her consent to these things  nay they ascribed all that Caius had done to her as the cause of it and said she had given a potion to Caius which had made him obnoxious to her and had tied him down to love her l y such evil methods  insomuch that she having rendered him distracted was become the author of all the mischiefs that had  befallen  Hence we learn that in tlie opinion of Sarurninus the sovereign authority of ihe consuls ant senate had been taken iwuy justice years before ihe death of Caius A 1X41 in the th year before the Christian aers when the triumvirate began under Cu sar Pwi j cj xÂ Bii Chap II ANTIOJJITES OF THE JEWS r befallen the Romans and that habitable world which was sub ject to them So that at length it was determined that she must die  nor could those of the contrary opinion at all prevail to have her saved  and Lupus was sent accordingly Nor was there any delay made in executing what he went about but he was subservient to those that sent him on the first opportunity as desirous to be no way blameable in what might be done for the advantage of the people So when he was come into the palace he found Cesonia who was Cains a wife lying by iier husband s dead body which also Jay down on the ground and destitute of all such things as the law allows to the dead and all over herself besmeared with the blood of her husband s wounds and bewailing the great affliction she was under her daughter lying by her also  and nothing else was heard in these her cir cumstances but her complaint of Caius as if he had not regard ed what she had often told him of before hand  which words of hers were taken in a different sense even at that time and are now esteemed equally ambiguous by those that hear of them and are still interpreted according to the different inclinations of people Now some said that the words denoted that she had ad vised him to leave off his mad behaviour and his barbarous cruelty to the citizens and to govern the public with modera tion and virtue lest he should perish by the same way upon their using him as he had used them But some said that as certain words had passed concerning the conspirators she desi red Caius to make no delay but immediately to put them all to death and this whether they were guilty or not and that there by he would be out of the fear of any danger and that this was what she reproached him for when she advised him so to do but he was too slow and tender in the matter And this was what Cesonia said and what the opinions of men were about it But when she saw Lupus approach she shewed him Caius s dead body and persuaded him to come nearer with lamentation and tears and as she perceived that Lupus was in disorder and approached her in order to execute some design disagreeable to himself she was well aware for what purpose he came and stretched out her naked throat and that very chearfully to him bewailing her case like one utterly despaired of her life and bidding him not to boggle at finishing the tragedy they had re solved upon relating to her So she boldly received her death s wound at the hand of Lupus as did the daughter after her So Lupus made haste to inform Cherea of what he had done 5 This was the end of Caius after he had reigned four years within four months He was even before he came to be em peror ill natured and one that had arrived at the utmost pitch  flf 134 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XIX of wickedness  a slave to his pleasures and a lover of calumny greatly affected by every terrible accident and on that account wf a very murderous disposition where he durst shew it He enjoyed his exorbitant power to this only purpose to injure those who least deserved it with unreasonable insolence and got his wealth by murder and injustice He laboured to appear above regarding either what was divine or agreeable to the laws but was a slave to the commendations of the populace  and whatso ever the laws determined to be shameful and punished that he esteemed more honourable than what was virtuous He was unmindful of his friends how intimate soever and though they were persons of the highest character and if he was once angry at any of them he would inflict punishment upon them on the smallest occasions and esteemed every man that endeavoured to lead a virtuous life his enemy And whatsoever he command ed he would not admit of any contradiction to his inclinations  whence it was that he had criminal conversation with his own sister   from which occasion chiefly it was also that a bitter ha tred first sprang up against him among the citizens that sort of incest not having been known of a long time  and so this provo ked men to distrust him and to hate him that was guilty of it And for any great or royal work that he ever did which might be for the present and for future ages nobody can name any such but only the haven that he made about Rhegium and Si cily for the reception of the ships that brought corn from E gypt which was indeed a work without dispute very great in itself and of very great advantage to the navigation Yet was not this work brought to perfection by him but was the one half of it left imperfect by reason of his want of application to it the cause of which was this that he employed his stu dies about useless matters and that by spending his money upon such pleasures as concerned no one s benefit but his own he could not exert his liberality in things that were undeniably of great consequence Otherwise he was an ex cellent orator and thoroughly acquainted with the Greek tongue as well as with his own country or Roman language He was also able off hand and readily to give answers to compositions made by others of considerable length and ac curacy He was also more skilful in persuading others to very great things than any one else and this from a natural affa bility Â Spanheim here notes from Suetonius that the name of Caius s sister with whom he was guilty of incest was Tirusilla  and that Suetonius adds he was guilty of the same crime with all his sisters also He notes farther that Suete nius omits the mention of the haven for ships which our author esteems the en ly public work for the good of the present and future ages which Caius left be Vuid him though in an imperfect condition Chap III ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEW bility of temper which had been improved by much exercise and pains taking for as he was the grandson of the brother of Tiberius whose successor he was this was a strong induce ment to his acquiring of learning because Tiberius aspired after the highest pitch of that sort of reputation  and Cains aspired after the like glory for eloquence being induced thereto by the letters of his kinsman and his emperor He was also among the first rank of his own citizens But the advantages he received from his learning did not countervail the mischief he brought upon himself in the exercise of his authority so difficult it is for those to obtain the virtue that is necessary for a wise man who have the absolute power to do what they please without controul At the first he got himself such friends as were in all respects the most worthy and was greatly beloved by them while he imitated their zealous application to the learning and to the glorious actions of the best men  but when he became insolent towards them they laid aside the kindness they had for him and began to hate him  from which hatred came that plot which they raised against him and wherein he perished CHAP III How Claudius was seized upon and brought out of his house and brought to the camp and how the Senate sent an embassage to him Â 1 VTOW Claudius as I said above went out of that way â â  along which Caius was gone  and as the family was in a mighty disorder upon the sad accident of the murder of Caius he was in great distress how to save himself and was found to have hidden himself in a certain narrow place f though he had no other occasion for suspicion of any dangers besides the dignity of his birth  for while he was a private man he beha ved himself with moderation and was contented with his present fortune applying himself to learning and especially to that of the Greeks and keeping himself entirely clear from every thing that might bring on any disturbance But as at this time the multitude were under a consternation and the whole palace was full of the soldiers madness and the very emperor s guards seem ed under the like fear and disorder with private persons the band called pretonan which was the purest part of the army was in consultation what was to be done at this juncture Now all those that  This Caius was the son of that excellent person Germanicus who was the son of Drusus the brother ot Tiberius the emperor f The first place Claudius came to was inhabited and called llcr neum as Spanheim here inform ui from Suetonius in Claud ch x AUTi vuitiES oF tnt JEW9 Book XIX that were at this consultation had little regard to the punishment Caius had suffered because he justly deserved such his fortune  but they were rather considering their own circumstances how they might take the best care of themselves especially while the Germans were busy in punishing the murderers of Caius  which yet was rather done to gratify their own savage temper than for the good bf the public  all which things disturbed Claudius who was afraid of his own safety and this particularly because he saw the heads of Asprenas and his partners carried about His station had been on a certain elevated place whither a few steps led him and whither he had retired in the dark by himself But when Gratus who was one of the soldiers that belonged to the palace saw him but did not well know by his countenance who he was because it was dark though he could well judge that it was a man who was privately there on some design he came nearer to him and when Claudius desired that he would retire he discovered who he was and owned him to be Claudius So he said to his followers  This is a Germanicus  come on let  us chuse him for our emperor But when Claudius saw they were making preparations for taking him away by force and was afraid they would kill him as they had killed Caius he be sought them to spare him putting them in mind how quietly he had demeaned himself and that he was unacquainted with what had been done Hereupon Gratus smiled upon him and took him by the right hand and said  Leave off Sir these low  thoughts of saving yourself while you ought to have greater  thoughts even of obtaining the empire which the gods out of  their concern for the habitable world by taking Caius out of  the way commit to thy virtuous conduct Go to therefore  and accept of the throne of thy ancestors So they took him up and carried him because he was not then able to go on foot such was his dread and his joy at what was told him 2 Now there was already gathered together about Gratus a great number of the guards  and when they saw Claudius car ried off they looked with a sad countenance as supposing that he was carried to execution for the mischiefs that had been lately done  while yet they thought him a man who never meddled with public affairs all his life long and one that had met with no contemptible dangers under the reign of Caius  and some of them thought it reasonable that the consuls should take cogni zance of these matters  and as still more and more of the sol diery  How Claudius another son of Drusus which Drusus was the father of Oct manicus could be here himself called Germanicus Suetonius informs us when he assures us that by a decree of the senate the sirname of Germanicm w s bestowed upon Drusus and his posterity also â In Claud ch i Chap III ANTIQJJITIES OF THE JEWS 137 diery got together the crowd about him ran away and Clau dius could hardly go on his body was then so weak  and those who carried his sedan upon an inquiry that was made about his being carried off ran away and saved themselves as despairing of their lord s preservation Bat when they were come into the large court of the palace which as the report goes about it was inhabited first of all the parts of the city of Rome and had just reached the public treasury many more soldiers came about him as glad to see Claudius s face and thought it exceed ing right to make him emperor on account of their kindness for Germanicus who was his brother and had left behind him a vast reputation among all that were acquainted with him They re flected also on the covetous temper of the leading men of the se nate and what great errors they had been guilty of when the se nate had the government formerly  they also considered the im possibility of such an undertaking as also what dangers they should be in if the government should come to a single person and that such an one should possess it as they had no hand in ad vancing and not to Claudius who would take it as their grant and as gained by their good will to him and would remember the favours they had done him and would make them a sufficient recoinpence for the same 3 These were the discourses the soldiers had one with ano ther by themselves and they communicated them to all such as came into them Now those that inquired about this matter willingly embraced the invitation that was made them to join with the rest  so they carried Claudius into the camp crowding about him as his guard and encompassing him about one chair man still succeeding another that their vehement endeavours might not be hindered But as to the populace and senators they dis agreed in their opinions The latter were very desirous to recover their former dignity and were zealous to get clear of the slavery that had been brought on them by the injurious treatments of the tyrants which the present opportunity afforded them  but for the people who were envious against them and knew that the emperors were capable of curbing their covetous temper and were a refuge from them they were veYy glad that Claudius had been seized upon and brought to them and thought that if Claudius were made emperor he would prevent a civil war such as there was in the days of Pompey But when the se nate knew that Claudius was brought into the camp by the sol diers they sent to him those of their body which had the best character for their virtues that they might inform him  that  he ought to do nothing by violence in order to gain the gc  vernment that he who was a single person one either already VOL III S  or 138 ANTIQJJIHES OF THE JEWS Book XIX u or hereafter to be a member of their body ought to yield to  the senate which consisted of so great a number  that he ought  to let the law take place in the disposal of all that related to  the public order and to remember how greatly the former ty  rants had afflicted their eity  and what dangers both he and  they had escaped under Caius  and that he ought not to hate  the heavy burden of tyranny when the injury is done by others  while he did himself wilfully treat his country after a mad and  insolent manner  that if he would comply with them and de  monstrate that his firm resolution was to live quietly and vir  tuously he would have the greatest honours decreed to him  that a free people could bestow and by subjecting himself to  the law would obtain this branch of commendation that he  acted like a man of virtue both as a ruler and a subject but  that if he would act foolishly and learn no wisdom by Caius s  death they would not permit him to go on  that a great part of  the army was got togetherfor them with plenty of weapons and  a great number of slaves which they could make use of that  good hope was a great matter in such cases as was also good  fortune and that the gods would never assist any others but  those that undertook to act with virtue and goodness who can  be no other than such as fight for the liberty of their country 4 Now these ambassadors Veranius and Brocchus who were both of them tribunes of the people made this speech to Clau dius and falling down upon their knees they begged of him that he would not throw the city into wars and misfortunes but when they saw what a multitude of soldiers encompassed and guarded Claudius and that the forces that were with the con suls were in comparison of them perfectly inconsiderable they added that  if he did desire the government he should accept  of it as given by the senate  that he would prosper better and  be happier if he came to it not by the injustice but by the  good will of those that would bestow it upon him CHAP IV What things king Agrippa did for Claudius  and how Claudius when he had taken the government commanded the murderers of Caius to be slain  1 VTOW Claudius though he was sensible after what an insolent manner the senate had sent to him yet did he according to their advice behave himself for the present with moderation but not so far that he could not recover himself out of his fright so he was encouraged to claim the government partly by the boldness of the soldiers and partly by the persua sion Chap III 139 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS sion of king Agrippa who exhorted him not to let such a do minion slip out of his hands when it came thus to him of its own accord Now this Agrippa with relation to Caius did what became one that had been so much honoured by him for he embraced Caius s body after he was dead and laid it upon a bed and covered it as well as he could and went out to the guards and told them that Caius was still alive  but he said that they should call for physicians since he was very ill of his wounds But when he had learned that Claudius was carried away violently by the soldiers he rushed through the crowd to him and when he found that he was in disorder and ready to resign up the government to the senate he encouraged him and desired him to keep the government but when he had said this to Claudius he retired home And upon the senate s sending for him he anointed his head with ointment as if he had lately accompanied with his wife and had dismissed her and thea came to them  he also asked of the senators what Claudius did  who told him the present state of affairs and then asked his opi nion about the settlement of the public He told them in words that he was ready to lose his life for the honour of the senate but desired them to consider what was for their advantage without any regard to what was most agreeable to them for that those who grasp at government will stand in need of weapons and soldiers to guard them unless they will set up without any preparation for it and so fall into danger And when the senate replied That  they would bring in weapons f in abundance and money and that as to an army a part of  it was already collected together for them and they would  raise a larger one by giving the slaves their liberty Agrip pa made answer  O senators  may you be able to compass what you have a mind to  yet will I immediately tell you  my thoughts because they tend to your preservation  take  notice then that the army which wiil fight for Claudius hath  been long exercised in warlike affairs  but our army will be  no better than a rude multitude of raw men and those such  as have been unexpectedly made free from slavery and ungo  vernable  we must then fight against those that are skilful in  war with men who know not so much as how to draw their a swords So that my opinion is that we should send some  persons to Claudius to persuade him to lay down the govern  ment and I am ready to be one of your ambassadors 2 Upon this speech of Agrippa the senate complied with him and he was sent among others and privately informed Claudius of the disorder the senate was in and gave insructions to answer them in a somewhat commanding strain and as one in S 2 vested 140 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XIX vested with dignity and authority Accordingly Claudius said to the ambassadors That Â he did not wonder the senate had no  mind to have an emperor over them because they had been â harassed by the barbarity of those that had formerly been at Â the head of their affairs  but that they should taste of an  equitable government under him and moderate times while  he should only be their ruler in name but the authority  should be equally common to them all  and since he had pass  ed through many and various scenes of life before their eyes Â it would be good for them not to distrust him So the am bassadors upon their hearing this his answer were dismissed But Claudius discoursed with the army which was there gather ed together who took oaths that they would persist in their fidelity to him  upon which he gave the guards every man five thousand  drachmae a piece and a proportionable quantity to their captains and promised to give the same to the rest of the armies wheresoever they were 3 And now the consuls called the senate together into the temple of Jupiter the Conqueror while it was still night but some of those senators concealed themselves in the city being uncertain what to do upon the hearing of this summons and some of them went out of the city to their own farms as fore seeing whether the public affairs were going and despairing of liberty  nay these supposed it much better for them to be slaves without danger to themselves and to live a lazy and in active life than by claiming the dignity of their forefathers to run the hazard of their own safety However an hundred and no more were gotten together  and as they were in consul tation about the present posture of affairs a sudden clamour was made by the soldiers that were on their side  desiring that  the senate would choose them an emperor and not bring the  government into ruin by setting up a multitude of rulers So they fully declared themselves to be for the giving the govern ment not to all but to one  but they gave the senate leave to look out for a person worthy to be set over them iiisomuch that now the affairs of the senate were much worse than before  because they had not only failed in the recovery of their liberty which they boasted themselves of but were in dread of Claudius also Yet were there those that hankered after the government both on  This number of drachma to be distributed to each private soldier 5000 drachma equal to 20 000 sesterces or L i6i Sterling seems much too large ami directly contradicts Suetonius ch x who makes them in aJl but 15 sesterces or 4s 4d Vet might Joseph us have this number from Agrippa junior thought doubt the thousands or at least the hundreds have been added by the transori licrs of which we have had several examples already in Josephus Chap IV ANTKLUITIES OF THE JEWS 141 on account of the dignity of their families and that accruing to the tn by their marriages  for Marcus Minutianus was illustri ous both by his own nobility and by his having married Julia the sister of Caius who accordingly was very ready to claim the government although the consuls discouraged him and made one delay after another in proposing it that Minucianus also who was one of Caius s murderers restrained Valerius of Asia from thinking of such things  and a prodigious slaughter there had been if leave had been given to these men to set up for themselves and oppose Claudius There were also a consider able number of gladiators besides and of those soldiers who kept watch by night in the city and rowers of ships who all ran into the camp  insomuch that of those who put in for the government some left off their pretensions in order to spare the city and others out of fear for their own persons 4 But as soon as ever it was day Cherea and those that were with him came into the senate and attempted to make speeches to the soldiers However the multitude of those sol diers when they saw that they were making signals for silence with their hands and were ready to begin to speak to them grew tumultuous and would not let them speak at all because they were all zealous to be under a monarchy and they demanded of the senate one for their rulers as not enduring any longer delays but the senate hesitated about either their own governing or how they should themselves be governed while the soldiers would not admit them to govern and the murderers of Caius would not permit the soldiers to dictate to them When they were in these circumstances Cherea was not able to contain the anger he had and promised that if they desired an emperor he would give them one if any one would bring him the watch word from Eutychus Now this Eutychus was charioteer of the green band faction styled Prasirie and a great friend of Caius who used to harass the soldiery with building stables for the horses and spent his time in ignominious labours which oc casioned Cherea to reproach them with him and to abuse them with much other scurrilous language  and told them  he would  bring them the head of Claudius  and that it was an amazing  thing that after their former madness they should commit  their government to a fool Yet were not they moved with his words but drew their swords and took up their ensigns and went to Claudius to join in taking the oath of fidelity to him So the senate were left without any body to defend them and the very consuls differed nothing from private persons They also under consternation aad sorrow men not knowing what would 142 AffTIQJJITIES OF THE tews Book XIX would become of them because Claudius was very angry at them so they fell a reproaching one another and repented of what they had done At which juncture Sabinus one of Caius s murderers threatened that he would sooner come into the midst of them and kill himself than consent to make Claudius empe ror and see slavery returning upon them  he also abused Cherea for loving his life too well while he who was the first in his con tempt of Caius could think it a good thing to live when even by all that they had done for the recovery of their liberty they found it impossible to do it But Cherea said he had no man ner of doubt upon him about killing himself that yet he would first sound the intentions of Claudius before he did it 5 These were the debates about the senate  but in the camp every body was crowding on all sides to pay their court to Claudius  and the other consul Quintus Pomponius was re proached by the soldiery as having rather exhorted the senate to recover their liberty  whereupon they drew their swords and were going to assault him and they had done it if Clau dius had not hindered them who snatched the consul out of the danger he was in and set him by him But he did not receive that part of the senate which was with Quintus in the like ho nourable manner  nay some of them received blows and were thrust away as they came to salute Claudius nay Aponius went away wounded and they were all in danger However king Agrippa went up to Claudius and desired he would treat the senators more gently  for if any mischief should come to the â enate he would have no others over whom to rule Claudius complied with him and called the senate together into the palace and was carried thither himself through the city while the soldiery conducted him though this was to the great vexation of the mul titude for Cherea and Sabinus two of Caius s murderers went in the fore front of them in an open manner while Polio whom Claudius a little before had made captain of his guards had sent them an epistolary edict to forbid them to appear in public Then did Claudius upon his coming to the palace get his friends together and desired their suffrages about Cherea They said that the work he had done was a glorious one but they accused him that he did it of perfidiousness and thought it just to in flict the punishment of death upon him to discountenance such actions for the time to come So Cherea was led to his execu tion and Lupus and many other Romans with him  now it is reported that Cherea bore this calamity courageously and this not only by the firmness of his own behaviour under it but by the repr oaches he laid upon Lupus who fell into tears for when   â Lupug Chap IV AVTIQJJITIES OF THE JEWS 143 Lupus laid his garment aside and complained of the cold  he said that cold was never hurtful to Lupus i e a wolf And as a great many men went along with them to see the sight when Cherea came to the place he asked the soldier who was to be their executioner whether this office was what he was used to  or whether this was the first time of his using his sword in that manner and desired him to bring him that very sword with which he himself slew Caius So he was happily killed at one stroke But Lupus did not meet with such good fortune in goinsj out of the world since he was timorous and had many blows levelled at his neck because he did not stretch it out boldly as he ought to have done 6 Now a few days after this as the parental solemnites were just at hand the Roman multitude made their usual oblations to their several ghosts and put portions into the fire in honour of Cherea and besought him to be merciful to them and not con tinue his anger against them for their ingratitude And this was the end of the life that Cherea came to But for Sabinus al though Claudius not only set him at liberty but gave him leave to retain his former command in the army yet did he think it would be unjust in him to fail of performing his obligations to his fellow confederates so he fell upon his sword and killed himself the wound reaching up to the very hilt of the sword f CHAP  This piercing cold here complained of by Lupus agrees well to the time of the year when Claudius began his reign  it being for certain about the months of November December or January and most probably a few days after Jan 24th and a few days before the Roman Pareiifalia t It is both here and elsewhere very remarkable that the murderers of the vilest tyrants who yet highly deserved to die when those murderers were under oaths or other the like obligations of fidelity to them were usually revenged and the murderers were cut off themselves and that after a remarkable manner and this sometimes as in the present case by those very persons who were not sorry for such murders but got kingdoms by them The examples are very nu merous both in sacred and profane histories and seem generally indications of divine vengeance on such murderers Nor is it unworthy of remark that such murderers of tyrants do it usually on such ill principles in such a cruel manner and as ready to involve the innocent with the guilty which was the case here chap i sect 14 and chap ii sect 4 as justly deserved the divine vengeance upon them Which seems to have been the case of Jehu also when besides the house of Ahab for whose slaughter he had a commission from God without any such commission any justice or commiseration he killed Ahab s great men and acquaintance and priests and forty two of the kindred of Ahaziah 2 Kings x iiâ 14 SeeHos i 4 I do not mean here to condemn Ehud or Judith or the like executioners of God s vengeance on those wicked tyrants who had unjustly oppressed God s own people under their theocracy who as they appear still to have had no selfish designs nor intentions to slay the innocent so had they still a di vine commission or a divine impulse which was their commission for what they did Judges iii 15 jp 20 Judith ix 2 Test Levi sect in Authent

which Caius had given him and therein commended the king highly He also made an addition to it of all that coun try over which Herod who was his grandfather had reigned that is Tudea and Samaria  and this he restored to him as due to his family But for Abila  of Lysanias and all that lay at mount Libanus he bestowed them upon him as out of his own territories He also made a league with this Agrippa confirm ed by oaths in the middle of the forum in the city of Rome he also took away from Antiochus that kingdom which he was possessed of but gave him a certain part of Cilicia and Com magena  he also set Alexander Lysimachus the alabarch at li berty who had been his old friend and steward to his mother Antonia but had been imprisoned by Caius whose son Marcus married Bernice the daughter of Agrippa But when Marcus Alexander s son was dead who had married her when she was a virgin Agrippa gave her in marriage to his brother Herod and begged for him of Claudius the kingdom of Chalcis 2 Now about this time there was a sedition between the Jews and the Greeks at the city of Alexandria  for when Caius was dead the nation of the Jews which had been very much morti fied under the reign of Cains and reduced to very great distress by the people of Alexandria recovered itself and immediately took up their arms to fight for themselves So Claudius sent an order to the president of Egypt

Alexandrians became insolent towards the  Jews that were among them which Caius out of his great  madness and want of understanding reduced the nation of the  Jews very low because they would not transgress the religious  worship of their country and call him a god I will there   fore that the nation of the Jews be not deprived of their  rights and privileges on account of the madness of Caius

dignity than before and sent letters to the pre sidents and procurators of the provinces that they should treat him very kindly Accordingly he returned in haste as was likely he would now he returned in much greater prosperity than he had before He also came to Jerusalem and offered all the sacrifices that belonged to him and omitted nothing f which the law required  on which account he ordained that many of the Nazarites should have their heads shorn And for the golden chain which had been given him by Caius of equal weight with that iron chain wherewith his royal hands had been bound he hung it up within the limits of the temple over the treasury t that it might be a memorial of the severe fata he had lain under and a testimony of his change for the better  that it might be a demonstration how the greatest prosperity may have a fall and that God sometimes raises up what is fallen down  for this chain thus dedicated afforded a document to all men  This form was so known and

got out of his bonds and was advanced to be a more illustrious king than he was before Whence men may un derstand that all that partake of human nature how great soever they are may fall and that those that fall may gain their for mer illustrious dignity again 2 And when Agrippa had entirely finished all the duties of the divine worship he removed Theophilus the son of Ananus from the highÂ priesthood and bestowed that honour of his on Si mon the son of Boethus whose name was also Cantheras whose daughter king Herod had married as I have related above Si mon therefore had the high priesthood with his brethren and with his father in like manner as the sons of Simon the son of Onias who were three had it formerly under the government of the Macedonians as we have related in a former book 3 When the king had settled the high priesthood after this manner he returned the kindness which the inhabitants of Jeru salem had shewed him  for he released them from the tax upon houses every one of which paid it before thinking it a good thing to requite the tender affection of those that loved him He also made Silus the general of his forces as a man who had par taken with him in many of his troubles But after a very little while the young men of Doris preferring a rash attempt be fore piety and being naturally bold and insolent carried a statue of Ca sar into a synagogue of the Jews and erected it there This procedure of theirs greatly provoked Agrippa 5 for it plainly tended to the dissolution of the laws of his country So he came without delay to Publius Petronius who

 it ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XIX  it is but a part of natural justice that every one should have  the power over the place belonging peculiarly to themselves  according to the determination of Caesar to say nothing of  my own determination which it would be ridiculous to men  tion after the emperor s edict which gives the Jews leave to i make use of their own customs as also gives order that they  enjoy equally the rights of citizens with the Greeks themselves  J therefore ordain that Proculus Vitelius the centurion bring  those men to me who contrary to Augustus s edict have been  so insolent as to do this thing at which those very men who  appear to be of principal reputation among them have an m  dignation also and alledge for themselves that it was not done  with their consent but by the violence of the multitude that  they might give an account of what hath been done I also  exhort the principal magistrates among them unless they have  a mind to have this action esteemed to be one with their con  sent and to inform the centurion of those that were guilty of  it and take care that no handle be hence taken for raising a  sedition or quarrel among them  which those seem to me to  hunt after who encourage such doings while both I myself  and king Agrippa for whom I have the highest honour have  nothing more under our care than that the nation of the Jews  may have no occasion given them of getting together under  the pretence of avenging themselves and become tumultuous  And that it may be more publicly known what Augustus r hath resolved about this whole matter I have subjoined those  edicts which he hath lately caused to be published at Alexan  dria and which although they may be well known to all  yet did king Agrippa for whom I have the highest honour  read them at that time before my tribunal and pleaded that the Jews ought not to be deprived of those rights which Au  gustus hath granted them I therefore charge you that yon  do not for the time to come seek for any occasion of sedition  or disturbance but that every one be allowed to follow their  own religious customs 4 Thus did Petronius take care of this matter that such d breach of the law might be corrected and that no such thing might be attempted afterwards against the Jews And now king Agrippa took the high priesthood away from Simon Cantheras a nd put Jonathan the son of Ananus into it again and owned that he was more worthy of that dignity than the other But this was not a thing acceptable to him to recover that his former dignity So he refused it and said  O king  Â  rejoice in the honour that thou hast for me and take it kindly  that thou wpuldest give me such a dignity of thy own incli  nations Chap Vll ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEW3 14  nations although God hath judged that I am not at all worthy  of the high priesthood I am satisfied with having once put  on the sacred garments  for I then put them OH after a more  holy manner than I should now receive them again But if  thou desirest that a person more worthy than myself should  have this honourable employment give me leave to name thec  such a one I have a brother that is pure from all sin  against God and of all offences against thyself I recommend  him to thee as one that is fit for this dignity So the king was pleased with these words of his and passed by Jonathan and according to his brother s desire bestowed the high priesthood upon Matthias Nor was it long before Marcus succeeded Pe tronius as president of Syria CHAP VII Concerning Silas and on what account it was that King Agrippa â was angry at him How Agrippa began to encompass Jerusa lem with a wall â and what benefits he bestowed on the inhabi tants of Berytus J 1 TVj OW Silas the general of the king s horse because he  had been faithful to him under all his misfortunes and had never refused to be a partaker with him in any of his dan gers but had oftentimes undergone the most hazardous dangers for him was full of assurance and thought he might expect a sort of equality with the king on account of the firmness of the friendship he had shewed to him Accordingly he would no where let the king sit as his superior and took the like li berty in speaking to him upon all occasions  till he became trou blesome to the king when they were merry together extolling himself beyond measure and of putting the king in mind of the severity he had undergone that he might by way of ostentation demonstrate what zeal he had shewed in his service  and was continually harping upon this string what pains he had taken for him and much enlarged still upon that subject The repe tition of this so frequently seemed to reproach the king inso much that he took the ungovernable liberty of talking very ill at his hands For the commemoration r f times when men have been under ignominy is by no means agreeable to them  and he is a very silly man who is perpetually relating to a person what kindness he had done him At last therefore Silas had so thoroughly provoked the king s indignation that he acted rather out of passion than good consideration and did not only turn Siâ Â las out of his place as general of his horse but sent him in bonds into his own country But the edge of his anger wore off by length of time and made room for more just reasonings as to his 150 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEW9 Book XlXi his judgment about this man and he considered how many la hours he had undergone tor his sake So when Agrippa was solemnizing his birth day and he gave festival entertainments to all his subjects he sent for Silas on the sudden to be his guest But as he was a very frank man he thought he had now a just handle given him to be angry  which he could not conceal from those that came for him but said to them  What honour is Â this the king invites me to which I conclude will soon be over   For the king hath not let me keep those original marks of the  good will 1 bore him which I once had from him  but he hath  plundered me and that unjustly also Does he think that I  leave off that liberty of speech which upon the consciousness  of my deserts I shall use more loudly than before and shall  relate how many misfortunes I have delivered him from  how  many labours I have undergone for him whereby I procured  him deliverance and respect as a reward for which I have  borne the hardships of bonds and a dark prison I shall never  forget this usage Nay perhaps my very soul when it is  departed out of the body will not forget the glorious actions  I did on his account This was the clamour he made and he ordered the messengers to tell it to the king So he percei ved that Silas was incurable in his folly and still suffered him to lie in prison 2 As for the walls of Jerusalem that were adjoining to the new city Bez etha he repaired them at the expence of the public and built them wider in breadth and higher in altitude  and he had made them too strong for all human power to demolish un less Marcus the then president of Syria had by letter informed Claudius Caesar of what he was doing And when Claudius had some suspicion of attempts for innovation he sent to Agrip pa to leave off the building of those walls presently So he obeyed as not thinking it proper to contradict Claudius 3 Now this king was by nature very beneficent and liberal in his gifts and very ambitious to oblige people with such large donations  and he made himself very illustrious by the many chargeable presents he made them He took delight in giving and rejoiced in living with good reputation He was not at all like that Herod who reigned before him  for that Herod was ill natured and severe in his punishments and had no mercy on them that he hated  and every one perceived that he was more friendly to the Greeks than to the Jews  for he adorned foreign cities with large presents in money  with building them baths and theatres besides nay in some of those places he erected temples and porticoes in others  but he did not vouchsafe to raise one of the least edifices in any Jewish city or make them any Chap VII ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 151 any donation that was worth mentioning But Agrippa s tem per was mild and equally liberal to all men He was humane to foreigners and made them sensible of his liberality He was in like manner rather of a gentle and compassionate temper Accordingly he loved to live continually at Jerusalem and was exactly careful in the observance of the laws of his country â He therefore kept himself entirely pure  nor did any day pass over his head without its appointed sacrifice 4 However there was a certain man of the Jewish nation at Jerusalem who appeared to be very accurate in the knowledge of the law His name was Simon This man got together an assembly while the king was absent at Cesarea and had the inso lence to accuse him as not living holily and that he might justly be excluded out of the temple since it belonged only to native Jews But the general of Agrippa s army informed him that Simon had made such a speech to the people So the king sent for him  and as he was sitting in the theatre he bid him sit down by him and said to him with a low and gentle voice  What is there done in this place that is contrary to the law  But he had nothing to say for himself but begged his pardon So the king was more easily reconciled to him than one could ha ve imagined as esteeming mildness a better quality in a king than anger and knowing that moderation is more becoming in great men than passion So he made Simon a small present and dismissed him 5 Now as Agrippa was a great builder in many places he paid a peculiar regard to the people of Berytus for he erected a theatre for them superior to many other of that sort both in sumptuousness and elegance as also an amphitheatre built at vast expences  and besides these he built them baths and porti coes and spared for no costs in any of his edifices to render them both handsome and large He also spent a great deal upon their dedication and exhibited shows upon them and brought thither musicians of all sorts and such as made the most delightful music of the greatest variety He also shewed his magnificence upon the theatre in his great number of gladiators  and there it was that he exhibited the several antagonists in order to please the spectators  no fewer indeed than seven hundred men to fight with seven hundred other men   and allotted all the malefactors he had for this exercise that both the malefactors might receive their punishment and that this operation of war might be a re creation in peace And thus were these criminals all destroyed at once CHAP Â A strange number of condemned criminals to be under the sentence of death it once no fewer it seems than 1400  152 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEW3 Book XIX CHAP VIII What other acts were done by Agrippa until his death  and after what manner he died  l WHEN Agrippa had finished what I have above related   at Berytus he removed to Tiberias a city of Gali lee Now he was in great esteem among other kings Accor dingly there came to him Antiochus king of Commagena Samp sigeramuSiking of Emesa andCotys who was king of the lesser Armenia and Polemo who was king of Pontus as also Herod his brother who was king of Chalcis All these he treated with agreeable entertainments and after an obliging manner and so to exhibit the greatness of his mind and so as to appear worthy of those respects which the kings paid to him by coming thus to see him However while these kings staid with him Mar cus the president of Syria came thither So the king in order to preserve that respect that was due to the Romans went out of the city to meet him as far as seven furlongs But this proved to be the beginning of a difference between him and Marcus  for he took with him in his chariot those other kings as his as sessors But Marcus had a suspicion what the meaning could be of so great a friendship of these kings one with another and did not think so close an agreement of so many potentates to be for the interest of the Romans He therefore sent some of his do mestics to every one of them and enjoined them to go their ways home without farther delay This was very ill taken by Agrippa who after that became his enemy And now he took the high priesthood away from Matthias and made Elioneus the son of Cantheras high priest in his stead 2 Now when Agrippa had reigned three years all over Ju dea he came to the city Cesarea which was formerly called Strato s Tower  and there he exhibited shows in honour of Cae sar upon his being informed that there was a certain festival ce lebrated to make vows for his safety At which festival a great multitude was gotten together of the principal persons and such as were of dignity through his province On the second day of which shows he put on a garment made wholly of silver and of a contexture truly wonderful and came into the theatre early in the morning at which time the silver of his garment being il luminated by the fresh reflection of the sun s rays upon it shone out after a surprising manner and was so resplendent as to spread an horror over those that looked intently upon him  and pre sently his flatterers cried out one from one place and another from another though not for his good that  he was a god  and Chap Vllf ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 153 and they added  Be thou merciful to us for although we have  hitherto reverenced thee only as a man yet shall we henceforth  own thee as superior to mortal nature Upon this the king did neither rebuke them nor reject their impious flattery But a s he presently afterward looked up he saw an owl  sitting on a certain rope over his head and immediately understood that this bird was the messenger of ill tidings as it had once been the mes senger of good tidings to him  and fell into the deepest sorrow A severe pain also arose in his belly and began in a most vio lent manner He therefore looked upon his friends and said  l whom you call a god am commanded presently to depart  this life   while Providence thus reproves the lying words you  just now said to me  and I who was by you called immortal  am immediately to be hurried away by death But I am  bound to accept of what Providence allots as it pleases God   for we have by no means lived ill but in a splendid and hap  py manner When he said this his pain was become vio lent Accordingly he was carried into the palace  and the ru mour went abroad every where that he Would certainly die in a little time But the multitude presently sat in sackcloth with their wives and children after the law of their country and besought God for the king s recovery All places were also full of moUrning and lamentation Now the king rested in a high Vol III U chamber  Ve have a mighty cry made here by some critics as if he great Eusebius had on purpose falsified this account of Josephus so as to make it agree with the

for they cast such reproaches upon the deceased as are not fit to be spoken of and so many of them as were then soldiers which were a great number went to his house and has tily carried off the statues of this king s daughters and all at once carried them into the brothel houses and when they hart set them on the tops of those houses they abused them to the utmost of their power and did such things to them as are too inf decent to be related They also laid themselves down in public places and celebrated general feastings with garlands on their heads and with ointments and libations to Charon and drinking to one another for joy that the king was expired Nay they were not only unmindful of Agrippa who had extended his li berality to them in abundance but of his grandfather Herod also who had himself rebuilt their cities and had raised them havens and temples at vast expences 2 Now Agrippa the son of the deceased was at Rome and brought up with Claudius Caesar And when Caesar was in formed that Agrippa was dead and that the inhabitants of Se baste and Cresarea had abused him he was sorry for the first news and was displeased with ihe ingratitude of those cities He was therefore disposed to send Agrippa junior away presently to suc ceed his father in the kingdom and was willing to confirm him in it by his oath But those freed men and friends of his who had the greatest authority with him dissuaded him from it and said that  it was a dangerous experiment to permit so large a â kingdom to come under the government of so very young a  man and one hardly yet arrived at years of discretion who Â would not be able to take sufficient care of its administration   while the weight of a kingdom is heavy enough to a grown  man So Caesar thought what they said to be reasonable Accordingly he sent Cuspios Fadus to be procurator of Judea and of the entire kingdom and paid that respect to the deceased as not to introduce Marcus who had been at variance with him into his kingdom But he determined in the first place to send orders to Fadus that he should chastise the inhabitants of Cesa rea and Sebaste for those abuses they had offered to him that was deceased and their madness towards his daughters that were still alive  and that he should remove that body of soldiers that were at Cesarea and Sebaste with the five regiments into Pontus that they might do their military duty there and that he should chdse U 2 an  Photius who made an extract out of this section says they were not the statues or images but the ladies themselves who were thus basely

such orders actually removed  for by sending ambassadors to Claudius they mollified him and got leave to abide in Judea still and these were the very men that became the source of very great calamities to the Jews in after times and sowed the seeds of that war which began under Florus whence it was that when Vespasian had subdued the country he removed them out of his province as we shall

PJnladelpiians against the Jews  and also con cerning the vestments of the high priest  1 TTPON the death of king Agrippa which we have rela  ted in the foregoing book Claudius Caesar sent Cas sius Longinus as successor to Marcus out of regard to the me mory of king Agrippa who had often desired of him by letters while he was alive that he would not suffer Marcus to be any longer president of Syria But Fadus as soon as be was come procurator into Judea found quarrelsome doings between the Jews that dwelt in Perea and the people of Philadelphia about their borders at a village called Mia that was filled with men of a warlike temper  for the Jews of Perea had taken up arms without the consent of their principal men and had destroyed many of the Philadelphians When Fadus was informed df this procedure it provoked him very much that they had not left the determination of the matter to him if they thought that the Philadelphians had done them any wrong but had rashly taken up arms against them So he seized upon three of their principal men who were also the causes of this sedition and ordered them to be bound and afterward had one of them slain whose name was Hannibal and he banished the other two Amram and Eleazar Tholotny also the arch robber was after some time brought to him bound and slain but not till he had done a world of mischief to Idumea and the Arabians And indeed from that time Judea was cleared of robberies by the care and providence of Fadus He also at this time senf for the high priests and the principal citizens of Jerusalem and this at the commands of the emperor and admonished them that they should lay up the long garment and the sacred vest ment which it is customary for nobody but the high priest to wear in the tower of Antonia that it might be under the power of the Romans as it had been formerly Now the Jews durst not contradict what he had said but desired Fadus however and Longinus which last was come to Jerusalem and had brought a great army with him out of a fear that the frigid in junctions 15 Book XX ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS junctions of Fadus should force the Jews to rebel that they might in the first place have leave to send ambassadors to Cae sar to petition him that they may have the holy vestments un der their own power and that in the next place they would tarry till they knew what answer Claudius would give to that their request So they replied that they would give them leave to send their ambassadors provided they would give them their sons as pledges fortheir peaceable behaviour And when they had agreed so to do and had given them the pledges they desi red the ambassadors were sent accordingly But when upon their coming to Rome Agrippa junior the son of the deceased understood the reason why they came for he dwelt with Clau dius Caesar as we said before he besought Caesar to grant the Jews their request about the holy vestments and to send a mes sage to Fadus accordingly 2 Hereupon Claudius called for the ambassadors and told them that  he granted their request and bade them to re turn their thanks to Agrippa for this favour which had been bestowed on them upon his entreaty And besides these an swers of his he sent the following letter by them   Claudius  Caesar Germanicus tribune of the people the fifth time and  designed consul the fourth time and imperator the tenth time  the father of his country to the magistrates senate and  people and the whole nation of the Jews sendeth greeting  Upon the presentation of your ambassadors to me by Agrippa  my friend whom I have brought

for the authority over the temple and the money of the sacred treasure and the choice of the high priests and obtained all that he petitioned for So that after that time this authority continued among  all his descendants till the end of the war Accordingly Herod removed the last high priest called Cantberas and bestowed that dignity on his successor Jo seph the son of Camus CHAP II How Helena the j ueen of Adialene and her son I zates embraced tie Jewish religion  and how Helena supplied the poor with corn ivben there was a great famine at Jerusalem  1 A BOUT this time it was that Helena queen of Adiabene  and her son Izates changed their course of life and embraced the Jewish customs and this on the occasion follow ing  Monobazus the king of Adiabene who had also the name of Bazeus fell in love with his sister Helena and took her to be his wife and begat her with child But as he was in bed with her one night he laid his hand upon his wife s belly and fell a sleep and seemed to hear a voice which bid him take his hand off his wife s belly and not hurt the infant that was therein which by God s providence would be safely born and have an happy end This voice put him into disorder  so he awaked immediately and told the story to his wife  and when his son was born he called him I zatet He had indeed Monobazus his elder brother by Helena also as he had other sons by other wives besides Yet did he openly place all his affections on this his only begotten  son Izates which was the origin of that envy which his other brethren by the same father bore to him  while on this account they hated him more and more and were all under great affliction that their father should prefer Izates be fore all them Now although their father were very sensible of these  Here is some error in the copies or mistake in Josephus for the power of appointing high priests after Herod king of Chalcis was dead and Agr ppa ju nior was made king of Chalcis in his room belonged to him and he exercised the same all along till Jerusalem was destroyed as Josephus elsewkere inform us ch viii sect 8 11 ch ix sect I 4 6 7 t Josephus here ufes the word tnvytn an only begotten son for no other than one best beloved as does both the Old and New Testament I mean where there were one or more sons besides Gen xxii 2 Heb xi 17 See the note on IS 1 ch xiii sect i JCO ANTIQJJITIES OF THE JEWS Book these their paffions yet did he forgive them as not indulging those passions out of art ill disposition but out of a desire each of them had to be beloved by their father However he sent Izates with many presents to Abennerig the king of Charax Spasini and that out of the great dread he was in about him lest he should come to some misfortune by the hatred his brethren bore him  and iie committed his son s preservation to him Upon which Abennerig gladly received the young man and had a great affe ion for him and n arried him to his own daughter whose name was Samacba  he also bestowed a country upon him from which he received large revenues   2 But when Monobazus was grown old and saw that he had but a little time to live he had a mind to come to the sight of his son before he died So he seat for him and embraced him after the most affectionate manner add bestowed on him the coun try called Carrx it was a soil that bare ammomUm in great plenty  there are also in it the remains of that ark wherein it is related that Noah escaped the deluge and where they are still shewn to such as are desirous to see them  Accordingly IzateS abode in that country until his father s death But the very day that Monobazus died queen Helena sent for all the grandees and governors of the kingdom and for those that had the armies com mitted to their command  and when they were come she made the following speech to them   I believe you are not unac  quainted that mv husband was desirous Izates should succeed  him in the government and thought him worthy so to do How  ever I wait your determination  for happy is he who receives  a kingdom not from a single person only hut from the willing  suffrages of a great many This she said in order to try those that were invited and to discover their sentiments Upon the hearing of which they first of all paid their homage to the queen as their custom was and then they said That  they confirmed Â the king s determination and would submit to it and they  rejoiced that Izates s father had preferred htm before the rest  of his brethren as being agreeable to all their wishes but that  they were desirous first of all to slay his brethren and kins  men that so the government might come securely to Izates l because if they were once destroyed all that fear would  be over which might arise from their hatred and envy  to him Helena replied to this That  she returned  them their thanks for their kindness to herself and to  Izates   It is here very remarkable that the remains of Noah s ark were believed to x stH Jn beifij

brethren till he should be there  himself and give his approbation to it So since these men had not prevailed with her l hen they advised her to slay them they exhorted her at least to keep them in bonds till he should come and that for their own security  they r lso gave her coun sel to set up some one whom she should put the greatest trust in as a governor of the kingdom in the mean time So Queen He lena complied with this counsel of theirs and setup Monobazus the eldest son to be king and put the diadem upon his head and gave him his father s ring with its signet as also the orna ment which they call Sampscr and exhorted him to administer the affairs of the kingdom till his brother should come  who came suddenly upon hearing that his father was dead and suc ceeded his brother Monobazus who resigned up the government to him 3 Now during the time Izates abode at Charax Spasini a certain Jewish merchant whose name was Ananias got amoag the women that belonged to the king and taught them to wor ship God according to the Jewish religion He moreover by their means became known to Izates and persuaded him in like manner to embrace that religion  he also at the earnest entreaty of Izates accompanied him when he was sent for by his father to come to Adiabene  it also happened that Helenu about the same time was instructed by a certain other Jew and went over to them But when Izates had taken the kingdom and was come to Adiabene and there saw his brethren and other kinsmen in bonds he was displeased it it and as he thought it an instance of impiety either to slay or imprison them but _ still thought it an hazardous thing for to let them have their li berty with the remembrance of the injuries that had been offer ed them he sent some of them and their children for hostages to Rome to Claudius Ceesar and sent the others to Artabanus the king of Parthia with the like intentions 4 And when he perceived that his mother was highly plea sed with the Jewish customs he made haste to change and to em brace them entirely  and as he supposed that he could not be thoroughly a Jew unless he were circumcised he was ready to have it doae But when his mother understood what he was about she endeavoured to hinder him from doing it and said to him that  this thing would bring him into danger and that as  he was a king he would thereby bring himself into greac  odium among his subjects when they should understand that  he was so fond of rites that were to them strange and foreign   and that they would never bear to be ruled over by a Jew This it was that she said to him and for the present persuaded VOL III X  162 ANTIQJJITIES OF THE JEWS  Book XX him to forbear And when he had related what she had said to Ananias he confirmed what his mother had said and when he had also threatened to leave him unless he complied with him he went away from him and said that Â he was afraid lest such  an action being once become public to all he should himself  be in danger of punishment for having been the occasion of  it and having been the king s instructor in actions that were Â of ill reputation  and he said that he might worship God  without being circumcised even though he did resolve to fol  low the Jewish law entirely which worship of God was of a  superior nature to circumcision He added that God would  forgive him though he did not perform the operation while l it was omitted out of necessity and for fear of his subjects So the king at that time complied with these persuasions of A nanias But afterwards as he had not quite left off his desire of doing this thing a certain other Jew that came out of Galilee whose name was Eleazar and who was esteemed very skilful in the learning of his country persuaded him to do the thing  for as he entered into his palace to salute him and found him read ing the law of Moses he said to him u Thou dost not consider  O king  that thou unjustly breakest the principal of those Â Â laws and art injurious to God himself by omitting to be cir  cumcised  for thou oughtest not only to read them but chiefly Â to practise what they enjoin thee How long wilt thou con  tinue uncircumcised  But if thou hast not yet read the law  about circumcision and dost not know how great impiety thou  art guilty of by neglecting it read it now When the king had heard what he said he delayed the thing no longer but re tired to another room and sent for a surgeon and did what he was commanded to do He then sent for his mother and Ana nias his tutor and informed them that he had done the thing j upon which they were presently struck with astonishment and fear and that to a great degree lest the thing should be openly discovered and censured and the king should hazard the loss of his kingdom while his subjects would not bear to be governed by a man who was so zealous in another religion  and lest they should themselves run some hazard because they would be sup posed the occasion of his so doing But it was God  himself who hindered what they feared from taking effect  for he pre served both Izates Himself and his sons when they fell into many dangers and procured their deliverance when it seemed to be impossible and demonstrated thereby that the fruit of piety does not  Josephus is very full and express in these three chapters iii iv and v in observing how carefully Divine Providence preserved this Izates king of Adi abene and his sons while he did what he tti ught was his bomideu duty not withstanding the strongest political motives to the coutrary Gbap III ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS  163 not perish as to those that have regard to him and fix their faith upon him only But these events we shall relate hereafter 5 But as to Helena the king s mother when she saw that the affairs of Izates s kingdom were in peace and that her son was an happy man and admired among all men and even among fo reigners by the means of God s providence over him she had a mind to go to the city Jerusalem in order to worship at that temple of God which was so very famous among all men and to offer her thank offerings there So she desired her son to give her leave to go thither  upon which he gave his consent to what she desired very willingly and made great preparations for her dismission and gave her a great deal of money and she went down to the city Jerusalem her son conducting her on her journey a great way Now her coming was of very great advantage to the people of Jerusalem  for whereas a famine did oppress them at that time and many people died for want of what was neces sary to procure food withal queen Helena sent some of her ser vants to Alexandria with money to buy a great quantity of corn and others of them to Cyprus to bring a cargo of dried figs And as soon as they were come back and had brought those pro visions which was done very quickly she distributed food to those that were in want of it and left a most excellent memo rial behind her of this benefaction which she bestowed on our whole nation And when her son Izates was informed of this famine he sent great sums of money to the principal men in Jerusalem However what favours this queen and king confer red upon our city Jerusalem shall be farther related hereafter  CHAP III How Artabanus the king of Partbia nut of fear of the secret con trivances of his subjects against Kth went to Izatcs and was by him reinstated in his government  as also how Bardanes Us son denounced war against Izates Â 1 13UT now Artabanus king of the Parthians perceiving  that the governors of the provinces had framed a plot against him did not think it safe for him to continue among them but resolved to go to Izates in hopes of finding some way for his preservation by his means and if possible for his return to his X 2 own  This farther account of the benefactions of Izates and Helena to the Jerusa lem Jews which Josephus here promises is I think no where performed by him in his present works But of this terrible famine itself in Judea take Dr Hud son s note here â This says he is that famine foretold by Agabus Acts xi  28 which happened when Claudius was consul the fourth time and not that  other which happened when Claudius was consul the second tinie and Cc sina  was his colleague asScaliger says upon Eusebitis p 174 Now when Jose phus had said a little afterward ch v sect 2 that  Tiberius Alexander sue  ceeded Cuspius Fadiis as piocurator he immediately subjoins that  under  16  avtiqtiities of THE iews Book XX own dominions So he came to Jzates and brought a thousand of his kindred and secants with him and met him upon the road while he well knew lzates but lzates did not know him When Artabaiuis stood near him and in the first place worshipped him according to the custom he then said to himi  O king  do not thou overlook me thy servant nor do thou  proudly reject the suit I make thee  for as I am reduced to  a low estate by the change of fortune and of a king am be  come a private man I stand in need of thy assistance Have  regard therefore unto the mcertainty of fortune and esteenl  the care thou shalt take of me to be taken of thyself also  for f if I be neglected and my subjects go off unpunished litany  other subjects will become the more insolent towards other  kings also And this speech A tabanus made with tears in his eyes and with a dejected countenance Now as soon as lza tes heard Artabanus s names and saw him stand as a supplicant before him he leaped down from his horse immediately and said to him  Take courage O king  nor be disturbed at thy pre  sent calamity as if it were incurable  for the Change of thy  sad condition shall be sudden  for thou shalt find me to be  more thy friend and thy assistant than thy hopes can promise  thee  for I will either re establish thee in the kingdom of  Parthia or lose my own 2 When he had said this he set Artabanus upon his horse and followed him on foot in honour of a king whom he owned as greater than himself which when Artabanus saw he was very uneasy at it and sware by his present fortune and honour that he would get down from his horse unless lzates would get upon his horse again and go before him So he complied with his desire and leaped upon his horse  and when he had brought him to his royal palace he shewed him all soyts of respect when they sat together and he gave him the upper place at festivals also as regarding not his present fortune but his former dig ftity and that upon this consideration also that the changes of fortune are common to all men He also wrote to the Parthi ans to persuade them to receive Artabanus again  and gave them his right hand and his faith that he should forget what was past and done and that he would undertake for this as a media tor between them Now the Parthians did not themselves re fuse  these procurators there happened a great famine in Judea Whence it is plain that this famine continued for many years on account of its duration under those two procurators Now Fadus was not sent into Judea till after the death of king Agrippa i e towards the latter end of the 4th year of Claudius so that this famine foretold by Agabus happened upon the 5th 6th and 7th years of Claudius as says Valesius on Euseb II 12 Of this famine also and queen Helena s supplies and her monument see Moses Chorenensis p 144 145 where it is observed in the notes that Pausanias mentions that her monument also Chap III 165 AWfIQJJITIES OF THE Ir WS fuse to receive him again but pleaded that it was not now in their power so to do  because they had committed the govern ment to another person who had accepted of it and whose name was Cinnamus and that they were afraid lest a civil war should rise on this account When Cinnamus understood their inten tions he wrote to Artabanus himself for he had been brought up by him and was of a nature good and gentle also and de sired him to put confidence in him and to come and take his own dominions again Accordingly Artabanus trusted him and returned home  when Cinnamus met him worshipped him and saluted him as a king and took the diadem off his own head and put it on the head of Artabanus 3 And thus was Artabanus restored to his kingdom again by the means of Izates when he had lost it by the means of the grandees of the kingdom Nor was he unmindful of the bene fits he had conferred upon him but rewarded him with such ho nours as were of greatest esteem among them  for he gave him leave to wear his tiara upright  and to sleep upon a golden bed which are privileges and marks of honour peculiar to the kings of Parthia He also cut off a large and fruitful country from the king of Armenia and bestowed it upon him The name of the country is Nisibis wherein the Macedonians had formerly built that city which they called Antioch of Mygdonia And these were the honours that were paid Izates by the king of the Parthians 4 But in no long time Artabanus died and left his kingdom Â o his son Bardanes Now this Bardanes came to Izates and would have persuaded him to join him with his army and to as sist him in the war he was preparing to make with the Romans  but he could not prevail with him For Izates so well knew the strength and good fortune of the Romans that he took Bar danes to attempt what was impossible to be done  and having besides sent his sons five in number and they but young also to learn accurately the language of our nation together with our learning as well as he had sent his mother to worship at our temple as I have said already was the more backward to a com pliance  and restrained Bardanes telling him perpetually of the great armies and famous actions of the Romans and thought thereby to terrify him and desired thereby to hinder him from that expedition But the Parthian king was provoked at this his behaviour and denounced war immediately against Izates Yet did he gain no advantage by this war because God cut off all his hopes therein  for the Parthians perceiving Bardanes s intentions  This privilege of wearing the tiara upright or with the tip of the cone erect is known to have been of old peculiar to great kings from Xenophon and others as Dr Hudson obsei veÂ here 1 56 Book XX ANTIQJJITIES OF THE JEWS intentions and how he had determined to make war with the Romans slew him and gave his kingdom to his brother Gotar zes He also in no long time perished by a plot made against him and Vologases his brother succeeded him who committed two of his provinces to two of his brothers by the same father i that of thg Medes to the elder Pacorus and Armenia to the younger Tiridates  CHAP IV How Izates was betrayed by his own subjects and fought against by the Arabians  and bow Izates by the providence of God was deiivered out of their hands Â i VTOW when the king s brother Monobazus and his other 1 kindred saw how Izates by his piety to God was become greatly esteemed by all men they also had a desire to leave the religion of their country and to embrace the customs of the Jews but that act of theirs was discovered by Izates p subjects Whereupon the grandees were much displeased and could not contain their anger at them  but had an intention when they should find a proper opportunity to inflict a punish inent upon them Accordingly they wrote to A bia king of the Arabians and promised him great sums of money if he would make an expedition against their king  and they farther promi sed him that on the first onset they would desert their king because they were desirous to punish him by reason of the ha tred he had to their religious worship then they obliged them selves by oaths to be faithful to each other and desired that he would make haste in this design The king of Arabia complied with their desires and brought a great army into the field and marched against Izates  and in the beginning of the first onset and before they came to a close fight those grandees as if they had a panic terror upon them all deserted Izates as they had agreed to do and turning their backs upon their enemies ran away Yet was not Izates dismayed at this  but when he understood that the grandees had betrayed him he also retired into his camp and made inquiry into the matter  and as soon as he knew who they were that had made this conspiracy with the king of Arabia he cut oft0 those that were found guilty  and renewing the fight on the next day he slew the greatest part of his enemies and forced all the rest to betake themselves to flight He also pursued their king and drove him into a for tress called Arsamus and following on the siege vigorously he took that fortress i And when he had plundered it of all the prey that was in it which was not small  he returned to Adia i  bene I tlhap IV ANTIQUITIES OF 1HE JEWS bene  yet did not he take Abii alive  because when he foiitd himself encompassed on every side he slew himself 2 But although the grandees of Adiabene had failed in their first attempt as being delivered UpJ by Gfod into their kind s hands yet would they not even thence quiet but wrote again to Vologases who was then king of Panliia and desired that he would kill Izates and set over fherri some other potentate who should be of a Parthian family for they said That  they M hated their own king for abrogating the laws of their fore fathers and embracing foreign custonfts1 j When the king of Parthia heard this he boldly made war upon Izates  and he had just pretence for this war he sent to hint and demanded back those honourable privileges whfch had btefr bestowed on him by his father and threatened on his refrfsftlj to mnke war upon him Upon hearing of this liat s was under no small trouble of mind as thinking it would be a reproach upon him to ap pear to resign those privileges that had been bestowed upon him out of cowardice  yet because he knew that though the king of Parthia should receive back those honours yet would he not be quiet he resblvcd to commit himself to God his protector in the present danger he was in of his life  and as he esteemed him to be his principal assistant he entrusted his children and his wives to a very strong fortress and laid up his corn in his citadels and set the hay and the grass on fire And when he had thus put things in order as well as he could he awaited the coming of the enemy And when the king of Parthia was come with a great army of footmen and horsemen which he did sooner than was expected for he iniarehed in great haste and had cast up a bank at the river that parted Adiabene from Media Izates also pitched his camp not far off having with him six thousand horsemen But there came a messenger to Izates sent by the king of Parthia who told him Â How large  his dominions were as reaching from the river Euphrates to  Bactria and enumerated that king s subjects  he also threaten   ed him that he should be punished as a person ungrateful to  his lords  and said that the God whom he worshipped could  not deliver him of the king s hands When the messenger had delivered this his message Izates replied That  he knew  the king of Parthia s power was much greater than his own   but that he knew also that God was much more powerful  than all men And when he had returned him this answer he betook himself to make supplication to God and threw  â  himself  This mourning and fasting and praying used by Izates with prostration nf his body and ashes upon liis head are plain signs that he was become either a Jew or an Ebionite Christian who indeed differed not much from proper Jews bee chap vi sect i However his supplications were heard and he was pro videmialJy delivered from that imminent dapger he was in 166 Book XX ANTIQJJIIUS OF THE JEWS himself upon the ground and put ashes upon his head in testi mony of his confusion and fasted together with his wives and children When he called upon God and said  O Lord and  Governor if I have not in vain committed myself to thy  goodness but have justly determined that thou only art the  Lord and principal of all beings come now to my assistance  and defend me from my enemies not only on my own account  but on account of their insolent behaviour with regard to thy M power while they have not feared to lift up their proud and  arrogant tongue against thee Thus did he lament and be moan himself with tears in his eyes  whereupon God heard his prayer And immediately that very night Vologases received letters the contents of which were these that a great band of Dahae and Sahae despising him now he was gone so long a jour ney from home had made an expedition and laid Parthia waste  so that he was forced to retire back without doing any thing And thus it was that Izates escaped the threatenings of the Par tisans by the providence of God 3 It was not long ere Izates died when he had completed fifty five years of his life and had ruled his kingdom twenty four years He left behind him twenty four sons and twenty four daughters  However he gave order that his brother Mo nobazus should succeed in the government thereby requiting him because while he was himself absent after their father s death he had faithfully preserved the government for him But when Helena his mother heard of her son s death she was in great heaviness as was but natural upon her loss of such a most dutiful son  yet was it a comfort to her that she heard the succession came to her eldest son Accordingly she went to him in haste  and when she was come into Adiabene she did not long outlive her son Izates But Monobazus sent her bones as well as those of Izates his brother to Jerusalem and gave order that they should be buried at the pyramids  which their mother had erected  they were three in number and distant more than three furlongs from the city Jerusalem But for the actions of Mo nobazus the king which he had during the rest of his life we will relate them hereafter f    CHAP  These pyramids or pillars erected by Helena queen of Adiabene near Je rusalem three in number are mentioned by Eusebius in his Eccles Hist B II ch ii for which Dr Hudson refers us to Valesius s notes upon that place â They are also mentioned by Pausanias as hath been already noted chap ii sect 0 Eel and guesses that that now called Absalom s pillar may be one of them f This account is now wanting Chap V Al fl iUlllES OF THE JEWS 169 CHAP V Concerning Theudas and the sons of Judas the Galilean  as also what calamity fell upon the Jews on the day ofthe passover j 1 VJOW it came to pass while Fadus was procurator of Ju â dea that a certain magician whose name was Theu das  persuaded a great part of the people to take their effects with them and follow him to the river Jordan  for he told them he was a prophet and that he would by his own command di vide the river and afford them an easy passage over it and ma ny were deluded by his words However Fadus did not per mit them to make any advantage of his wild attempt but sent a troop of horsemen out against them  who falling upon them un expectedly slew many of them and took many of them alive They also took Theudas alive and cut off his head and carried it to Jerusalem This was what befel the Jews in the time of Cuspius Fadus s government 2 Then came Tiberius Alexander as successor to Fadus  he was the son of Alexander the Alabarch of Alexandria which A lexander was a principal person among all his contemporaries both for his family and wealth  he was also more eminent for his piety than this his son Alexander for he did not continue in the religion of his country Under thes e procurators that great famine happened in Judea in which queen Helena bought corn inEgypt at a great expence and distributed it to those that were in want as I have related already And besides this the sons of Judas of Galilee were now slain I mean of that Judas who cau sed the people to revolt when Cyrenius came to take an account of the estates of the Jews as we have shewed in a foregoing book The names of those sons were JameS and Simon whom Alex ander commanded to be crucified But now Herod king of Chalcis removed Joseph the son of Camydus from the high priest hood and made Ananias the sou of Nebedus hissuccessor And now it was that Cumanus came a successor to Tiberius A lexander  as also that Herod brother of Agrippa the great king departed this life in the eighth year of the reign of Claudius Cx sar He left behind him three sons Aristobulus whom lie had by his first wife with Bemictanus and Hircanus both whoni he had by Bernice his brother s daughter But Claudius Caesar bestowed his dominions on Agrippa junior 3 Now while the Jewish affairs were under the administra tion of Cumanus there happened a great tumult at the city of Je VOL III Y rusalem  This Theudas who arose under Fadas the procurator about A D 45 or 46 could not bear that Theudas who arose in the days of the taxing under Cy renius or about A D 7 Acts v 36 37 Who that earlier Theudas was see 170 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XX rusalem and many of the Jews perished therein But I shall first explain the occasion whence it was derived When that feast which is called the Passover was at hand at which time our custom is to use unleavened bread and a great multitude was gathered together from all parts to that feast Cumanus was a fraid lest some attempt of innovation should then be made by them  so he ordered that one regiment of the army should take their arms and stand in the temple cloisters to repress any at tempts of innovation if perchance any such should begin  and this was no more than what the former procurators of Judea did at such festivals But on the fourth day of the feast a certain soldier let down his breeches and exposed his privy members to the multitude which put those that saw him into a furious rager and made them cry out that this impious action was not done to reproach them but God himself nay some of them reproach ed Cumanus and pretended that the soldier was set on by him which when Cumanus heard he was also himself not a little provoked at such reproaches laid upon him  yet did he exhort them to leave off such seditious attempts and not to raise a tu mult at the festival But when he could not induce them to be quiet for they still went on in their reproaches to him he gave order that the whole army should take their entire armour and come to Antonia which was a fortress as we have said already which overlooked the temple  but when the multitude saw the soldiers there they were affrighted at them and ran away hasti ly  but as the passages out were but narrow and as they thought their enemies followed them they were crowded together in their flight and a great number were pressed to death in those narrow passages  nor indeed was the number fewer than twenty thou sand that perished in this tumult So instead of a festival they had at last a mournful day of it and they all of them forgot their prayers and sacrifices and betook themselves to lamentation and weeping  so great an afHiction did the impudent obscene ness of a single soldier bring upon them  4 Now before this their first mourning was over another mischief befell them also  for some of those that raised the fore going tumult when they were travelling along the public road about an hundred furlongs from the city robbed Stephanus a servant of Caesar as he was journeying and plundered him of all that he had with him Which things when Cumanus heard of he  This and many more tumults and seditions which arose at the Jewish festi vals in Josephus illustrate the cautious procedure of the Jewish governors when they said Matt xxvi 5  Let us not take Jesus on the feast day lest there be  an uproar among the people as Reland well observes on this place Josephus also takes notice of the same thing Of the War B I ch iv sect 3 Chap VI ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Ill he sent soldiers immediately and ordered them to plunder the neighbouring villages and to bring the most eminent persons a mong them in bonds to him Now as this devastation was making one of the soldiers seized the laws of Moses that lay in one of those villages and brought them out before the eyes of all present and tore them to pieces  and this was done with re proachful language and much scurrility Which things when the Jews heard of they ran together and that in great numbers and came down to Cesarea where Cuvnanus then was and be sought him that he would avenge not themselves but God him self whose laws had been affronted for that they could not beat lo live any longer if the laws of their forefathers must be affront ed after this manner Accordingly Cumanus out of fear left the multitude should go into a sedition and by the advice of his friends also took care that the soldier who had offered the affront to the laws should be beheaded and thereby put a stop to the edition which was ready to be kindled a second time CHAP VI flo ui there happened a quarrel between the Jews and the Samari tans and how Claudius put an end to their differences  1 TVTOW there arose a quarrel between the Samaritans and  the Jews on the occasion following  It was the custom of the Galileans when they came to the holy city at the festi vals to take their journeys through the country of the Sama ritans   and at this time there lay in the road they took a village that was called Ginoa which was situated in the limits of Samaria and the great plain where certain persons thereto belonging fought with the Galileans and killed a great many of them But when the principal of the Galileans were informed of what had been done they came to Cumanus and desired him to avenge the murder of those that were killed  but he was in duced by the Samaritans with money to do nothing in the matter upon which the Galileans were much displeased and persuaded the multitude of the Jews to betake themselves to arms and to regain their liberty saying That  slavery was  in itself a bitter thing but that when it was joined with di  rect injuries it was perfectly intolerable And when their principal men endeavoured to pacify them and promised to en deavour to persuade Cumanus to avenge those that were killed Y 2 Â they  This constant passage of the Galileans through the country of Samaria as they went to Judea and Jerusalem illustrates several passages in the gospels to the same purpose as Dr Hudson rightly observes See Luke xvii i John iv 4 See also Josephus in his own life sect 52 where that journey is determined t three davs ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XX they would not hearken to them but took their weapons and entreated the assistance of Eleazer the son of Dineas a robber  who had many years made his abode in the mountains with which assistance they plundered many villages of the Samaritans When Cumanus heard of this action of theirs he took the band of Sebaste with four regiments of footmen and armed the Sa maritans and marched out against the Jews and caught them and slew many of them and took a great number of them alive  whereupon those that were the most eminent persons at Â Jerusalem and that both in regard to the respect that was paid V them and the families they were of as soon as they saw to what  an height things were gone put on sackcloth and heaped ashes yon their heads and by all possible means besought the sedi tious and persuaded them that they would set before their eyes the utter subversion  of their country the conflagration of their temple and the slavery of themselves their wixes and children which would be the consequences of what they were doing an d would alter their minds would cast away their weapons and for the future be quiet and return to their own homes These persuasions of theirs prevailed upon them So the people dis persed themselves and the robbers went away again to tbejr places of strength  and after this time all Judea was over run with robberies 2 But the principal of the Samaritans went to Ummidius Quadratus the president of Syria who at that time was at Tyre and accused the Jews of setting their villages on fire and plundering them  and said withal That  they were not so  much displeased at what they had suffered as they were at the  contempt thereby shewed the Romans  while if they had re  ceived any injury they ought to have made them the judges  of what had been done and not presently to make such de  vastation as if they had not the Romans for their governors   on which account they came to him in order to obtain that Â vengeance they wanted This was the accusation which the Samaritans brought against the Jews But the Jews affirmed that the Samaritans were the authors of this tumult and fighting and that in the first place Cumanus had been corrupted by their gifts and passed over the murder of those that were slain in si lence Which allegations when Â uadi atus heard he put oft the hearing of the cause and promised that he would give sentence when he should come into Judea and should have a more exact knowledge  Our Saviour had fcretr ld that tlie Jews rejection of his gnspcl xvculd bring upon them among other miseries these three which they themselves here shew they exptcted would be the consequences of their present tumults ancl seditions the utter subversion of their country the conflagration of their

was it not long ere Quadratus came to  Samaria where upon hearing the cause he supposed that the  Samaritans were the authors of that disturbance But when he was informed that certain of the Jews were making innova tions he ordered those to be crucified whom Cumanus had taken captives From whence he came to a certain village called Lyd dn which was not less than a city in largeness and there heard tlie Samaritan cause a second time before his tribunal and there learned from a certain Samaritan that one of the chief of the Jews whose name was Dortu t and some other innovators with him four in number persuaded the multitude to a revolt from die Romans  whom Quadratus ordered to be put to death  b f still he sent away Ananias the high priest and Ananus the com mander of the temple in bonds to Rome to give an account of what they had done to Claudius Caesar He also ordered the principal men both of the Samaritans and of the Jews as also Cumanus the procurator and Celer the tribune to go to Italy to th e emperor that he might hear their cause and determine their differences one with another But he came again to the city of Jerusalem out of his fear that the multitude of the Jews should attempt some innovations  but he found the city in a peaceable state and celebrating one of the usual festivals of their country to God So he believed that they would not attempt any innovations and left them at the celebration of the festival and returned to Antioch 3 Now Cumanus and the principal of thÂ Samaritans who were sent to Rome had a day appointed them by the emperor whereon they were to have pleaded their cause about the quar rels they had one with another But now Cfesar s freed men and his friends were very zealous on the behalf of Cumanus and the Samaritans  and they had prevailed over the Jews un less Agrippa junior who was then at Rome had seen the prin cipal of the Jews hard set and had earnestly entreated Agrip pina the emperor s wife to persuade her husband to hear the cause so as was agreeable to his justice and to condemn those to be punished who were really the authors of this revolt from the Roman government Whereupon Claudius was so well dis posed before hand that when he had heard the cause and found that the Samaritans had been the ringleaders in those mischie vous doings he gave order that those who came up to him should be slain and that Cumanus should be banished He also gave order that Celer the tribune should be carried back to Jerusa lem and should be drawn through the city in the sight of all the people and then should be slair CHAP AttTIOJUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XX CHAP VII Felix is made procurator of Judea  as also concerning Agrippa junior and his sisters Â 1 CO Claudius sent Felix the brother of Pallans to take  care of the affairs of Judea  and when he had already completed the twelfth year of his reign he had bestowed upon Agrippa the tetrarchy of Philip and Batanea and added thereto Trachonitis with Abila which last had been the tetrar  chy of Lysanias but he took from him Chalcis when he had  been governor thereof four years And when Agrippa had received these countries as the gift of Caesar he gave his sister IXrusilla in marriage to Azizus king of Emesa upon his con sent to be circumcised  for Epiphaaes the son of king An tiochus had refused to marry her because after he had pro mised her father formerly to come over to the Jewish religion he would not now perform that promise He also gave Ma riamne in marriage to Archelaus the son of Helcias to whom she had formerly been betrothed by Agrippa her father  from which marriage was derived a daughter whoie name was Ber nice 2 But for the marriage of Drusilla with Azizus it was in no long time afterward dissolved upon the following occasion  While Felix was procurator of Judea he saw this Drusilla and fell in love with her  for she did indeed exceed all other women in beauty  and he sent to her a person whose name was Simon  one  This Simon a friend of Felix a Jew born in Cyprus though he pretended to be a magician and seems to have been wicked enough could hardly be that famous Simon the magician in the Acts of the Apostles viii 9 c as some are ready to suppose This Simon mentioned in the Acts was not properly a Jew bat a Samaritan of the town of Gittae in the country of Samaria as the Apostolical Constitutions VI 7 the Recognitions of Clement II 6 and Justin Martyr him self born in the country of Samaria Apology 1 34 inform us He was also the author not of any ancient Jewish but of the first Gentile heresies as the fore mentioned authors assure us So I suppose him a different person from the other I mean this only upon the hypothesis that Josephus was not misinformed as tohis feeing a Cypriot Jew  for otherwise the time the name the profession and the wickedness of them both would strongly incline one to believe them the very same As to that Drusilla the sister of Agrippa junior as Josephus informs us here md a Jewess as St Luke informs us Acts xxiv 74 whom this Simon mentioned by Josephus persuaded to leave her former husband Azizus king of Emesa a proselyte of justice and to marry Felix the heathen procurator of Judea Tacit Hist V 9 supposes her to be an heathen and the grand daughter of Antonius and Cleopatra contrary both to St Luke and Josephus Now Tacitus lived some what too remote both as to time and place to be compared with either of those Jewish writers in a matter concerning the Jews in Judea in their own days and concerning a sister of Agrippa junior with which Agrippa Josephus was himself so well acquainted It is probable that Tacitus may say true when he informs us that this Felix who had in all three wives or queens as Suetonius in Clau dius sect 28 assures us did once marry such a grandchild of Antonius and Cleopatra and finding the name of one of them to have been Drusilla he mis took her for that other wife whose name he did not know Chap VIII ANTIQtTITIES OF THE JEWS ITS one of his friends  a Jew he was and by birth a Cypriot and one who pretended to be a magician and endeavoured to persuade her to forsake her present husband and marry him  and pro mised that if she would not refuse him he would make her a happy woman Accordingly she acted ill and because she was desirous to avoid her sister Bernice s envy for she was very ill treated by her on account of her beauty was prevailed upon to transgress the laws of her forefathers and to marry Felix  and when he had had a son by her he named him Agrippa But after what manner that young man with his wife perished at the conflagration  of the mountain Vesuvius in the days of Titus Caesar shall be related hereafter f 3 But as for Bernice she lived a widow a long while after the death of Herod king of Chalcis who was both her hus band and her uncle  but when the report went that she had criminal conversation with her brother Agrippa junior she persuaded Polemo who was king of Cilicia to be circumcised and to marry her as supposing that by this means she should prove those calumnies upon her to be false  and Polemo was prevailed upon and that chiefly on account of her riches Yet did not this matrimony endure long  but Bernice left Polenjo and as was said with impure intentions So he forsook at once this matrimony and the Jewish religion  and at the same time Mariamne put away Archelaus and was married to Demetrius the principal man among the Alexandrian Jews both for his fa mily and his wealth and indeed he was then their alabarch So she named her son whom she had by him Agrippinus But of all these particulars we shall hereafter treat more exactly J CHAP VIII After what manner upon the death of Claudius Ifcro succeeded in the government  at also what barbarous things he did Con cerning the robbers murderers and Impostors that arose while Felix and Festus were procurators of Judea J 1 VTOW Claudius Caesardied when he had reigned thirteen  years eight months and twenty days   and a report went about that he was poisoned by his wife Agrippina Her father  This eruption of Vesuvius was one of the greatest we have in history See Bianchini s curious and important observations on this Vesuvius and its seven se  veral great eruptions with their remains vitrified and still existing in so many different ifata under ground till the diggers came to the antediluvian waters with their propqrtionabfe intersiices implying the deluge to have been above 2500 years before the Christian aera according to our exactest chronology  This is now wanting J This also is now wanting  This duration of the reign of Claudius agrees with Dio as Dr Hudson here remarks as he also remarks that Nero s name which was at first L Domitivt JE i obarbus after Claudius had adopted him was Nero Claudius Ceesar Drnsn 1 6 Book XX ANTIOJJITIES OF THE JEWS father was Germanicus the brother of Caesar Her husband was Domitius Enobarbus one of the most illustrious persons that was in the city of Rome  after whose death and her long continuance in widowhood Claudius took her to wife She brought along with her a son Domitius of the same name with his father He had before this slain his wife Messalina out of jealousy by whom he had his children Britannicus and Octavia  their eldest sister was Antonia whom he had by Pelina his first wife He also married Octavia to Nero  for that was the name that Caesar gave him afterward upon his adopting him for his Son 2 But now Agrippina was afraid lest when Britannicus should come to man s estate he should succeed his father in the govern ment and desired to seize upon the principality beforehand for her own son Nero  upon which the report went that she thence compassed the death of Claudius Accordingly she sent Burrhus the general of the army immediately and with him the tribunes and such also of the rreed men as were of the greatest authority to bring Nero away into the camp and to salute him emperor And when Nero had thus obtained the government he got Bri tannicus to be so poisoned that the multitude should not perceive it although he publicly put Jlis own mother to death not long afterward making her this requital not only for being born of her but by bringing it so about by her contrivances that he ob tained the Roman empire He also slew Octavia his own wife and many other illustrious persons under this pretence that they plotted against him 3 But I omit any farther discourse about these affairs  for there have been a great many who have composed the history of Nero some of which have departed from the truth of facts out of favour as having received benefits from him  while others out of hatred to him and the great ill will which they bare him have so impudently raved against him with their lies that they justly deserve to be condemned Nor do I wonder at such as have told lies of Nero since they have not in their wri tings preserved the truth of history as to those facts that were earlier than his time even when the actors could have no way incurred their hatred since those writers lived a long time after them But as to those that have no regard to truth they may write as they please  for in that they take delight but as to ourselves who have made truth our direct aim we shall brief ly touch upon what only belongs remotely to this undertaking but shall relate what hath happened to us Jews with great accu racy and shall not grudge our pains in giving an account both of the calamities we have suffered and of the crimes we have been guilty of I will now therefore return to the relation of our swn affairs 4 For Chap VIII ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEV s 17T 4 For in the first year of the reign of Nero upon the death of Azizus king of Emesa Soemus  his brother succeeded in his kingdom and Aristobulus the son of Herod king of Chal cis was intrusted by Nero with the government of Lesser Ar menia Caesar also bestowed on Agrippa a certain part of Ga lilee Tiberias f and Taricheae and ordered them to submit to his jurisdiction He gave him also Julias a city of Perea with fourteen villages that lay about it 5 Now as for the affairs of the Jews they grew worse and worse continually  for the country was again filled with rob bers and impostors who deluded the multitude Yet did Felix catch and put to death many of those impostors every day to gether with the robbers He also caught Eleazer the son of Dmeas who had gotten together a company of robbers and this he did by treachery  for he gave him assurance that he should suffer no harm and thereby persuaded him to come to him but when he came he bound him and sent him to Rome Felix also bore an ill will to Jonathan the high priest because he frequently gave him admonitions about governing the Jewish af fairs better than he did lest he should himself have complaints made of him by the multitude since hs it was who had desired Caesar to send him as procurator of Judea So Felix contrived a method whereby he might get rid of him now he was become so continually troublesome to him  for such continual admoni tions are grievous to those who are disposed to act unjustly Wherefore Felix persuaded one of Jonathan s mostfaithful friends a citizen of Jerusalem whose name was Doras to bring the robÂ bers upon Jonathan in order to kill him  and this he did by promising to give him a great deal of money for so doing Do ras complied with the proposal and contrived matters so that the robbers might murder him after the following manner Certain of those robbers went up to the city as if they were going to worship God while they had daggers under their garments and by thus mingling themselves among the multitude they slew Jonathan J and as this murder was never avenged the robbers VOL III Z went Â This Soemus is elsewhere mentioned by Josephns in his own life sect II as also by Dio Cassius and Tacitus as Dr Hudson informs us t This agrees with Josephus s frequent accounts elsewhere in his own Life that Tiberias and TaricheiE and Gamala were under this Agrippa junior till Justus th6 son of Pistus seized upon them for the Jews upon the breaking out of the u ar J This treacherous and barbarous murder of the good high priest Jonathan by r ie contrivance of this wicked procurator Felix was the immediate occasion of the ensuing murders by the Sicarii or ruffians and one great cause of the follow ing horrid cruelties and miseries of the Jewish nation as Josephus here sup s whose excellent reflection on the gross wickedness of that nation as the ct cause of their terrible destruction is well worthy the attention of every 719  Book XX ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS went up with the greatest security at the festivals after this time and having weapons concealed in like manner as before and min gling themselves among the multitude they slew certain of their own enemies and were subservient to other men for money and ilew others not only in remote parts of the city but in the tem ple itself also  for they had the boldness to murder men there without thinking of the impiety of which they were guilty And this seems to me to have been the reasons why God out of his hatred of these men s wickedness rejected ouf city  and as for the temple he no longer esteemed it sufficiently pure for him to inhabit therein but brought the Romans upon us and threw a fire upon the city to purge it and brought upon us our wives and children slavery as desirous to make us wiser by our calamities 6 These works that were done by the robbers filled the city with all sorts of impiety And now these  impostors and de ceivers persuaded the multitude to follow them into the wilder ness and pretended that they would exhibit manifest wonders and signs that should be performed by the providence of God And many that were prevailed on by tb m suffered the punish ments of th ir folly  For Felix brought them back and then pu nished Jewish and of every Christian reader And since we are soon coming to the catalogue of the Jewish high priests it may not be amiss with Reland to insert this Jonathan among them and to transcribe his particular catalogue of the last twenty eight high priests taken out of Josephus and begin with Ana nelus who was made by Herod the Great See Antiq B XV ch ii sect 4 and the note there X Anafielus 15 Theophilus his brother and son of a Aristabuhn

mentioned about the middle of this citalogue there are no other than those Annas and Caiaphas so often mention ed in the four gospels and that Ananiasi the son of Ntbedeus was that high priest before whom St Paul pleaded his own cause Acts xxiv t Of these Jewish impostors and false prophets with many other circumstan ces and miseries of the Jews till their utter destruction foretold by our Saviour See Lit Accompl of Proph p 58â 75 Chap VIII ANTIQJJITIES OF THE JEWS nished them Moreover there came out of Egypt  about this time to Jerusalem one that said he was a prophet and advised the multitude of the common people to go along with him to the Mount of Olives as it was called which lay over against the city and at the distance of five furlongs He said farthei that he would shew them from hence how at his command the walls of Jerusalem would fall down  and he promised them that he would procure them an entrance into the city through those walls when they were fallen down Now when Felix was in formed of these things he ordered his soldiers to take their wear pons and came against them with a great number of horsemen and footmen from Jerusalem and attacked the Egyptian and the people that were with him He also slew four hundred of them and took two hundred alive But the Egyptian himself escaped out of the fight but did not appear any more And again the robbers stirred up the people to make war with the Romans and said they ought not to obey them at all  and when any person would not comply with them they set fire io their villages and plundered them 7 And now it was that a great sedition arose between the Jews that inhabited Cesarea and the Syrians who dwelt there also concerning their equal right to the privileges belonging to citizens for the Jews claimed the pre eminence because Herod their king was the builder of Cesarea and because he was bv birth a Jew Now the Syrians did not deny what was alledged about Herod but they said that Cesarea was formerly called Strato s tower and that then there was not one Jewish inhabitant When the presidents of that country heard of these disorder they caught the authors of them on both sides and tormented them with stripes and by that means put a stop to the distur bance for a time But the Jewish citizens depending on their wealth and on that account despising the Syrians reproached them again and hoped to provoke them by such reproaches However the Syrians though they were inferior in wealth yet valuing themselves highly on this account that the greatest part of Roman soldiers that were there were either of Cesarea or Sebaste they also for some time used reproachful language to the Jews also  and thus it was till at length they came to throw ing stones at one another and several were wounded and fell on both sides though still the Jews were the conquerors But when Felix saw that this quarrel was become a kind of war he came upon them on the sudden and desired the Jews to desist and when they refused so to do he armed his soldiers and sent them Z 2 out Â Of this Egyptian impostor and the number of his followers in Josephus ses cts xxi 38 ISO ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS Book XX out upon them and slew many of them and took more of them alive and permitted his soldiers to plunder some of the houses of the citizens which were full of riches Now those Jews that were more moderate and of principal dignity among them were afraid of themselves and desired of Felix that he would sound a retreat to his soldiers and spare them for the future and afford them room for repentance for what they had done  and Felix was prevailed upon to do so 8 About this time king Agrippa gave the high priesthood to Ismael who was the son of Fabi And now arose a sedition be tween the high priests and the principal men of the multitude of Jerusalem  each of which got them a company of the bold est sort of men and of those that loved innovations about them and became leaders to them  and when they struggled together they did it by casting reproachful words against one another and by throwing stones also And there was no body to re prove them but these disorders were done after a licentious manner in the city as if it had no government over it And such was the impudence  and boldness that had seized on the high priests that they had the hardiness to send their servants into the threshing floors to take away those tithes that were due to the priests  insomuch that it so fell out that the poorer sort of the priests died for want To this degree did the violence of the seditious prevail over all right and justice  9 Now when Porcius Festus was sent as successor to Felix by Nero the principal of the Jewish inhabitants of Cesarea went up to Rome to accuse Felix  and he had certainly been brought 1 1 punishment unless Nero had yielded to the importunate so licitations of his brother Pallas who was at that time had in the greatest honour by him Two of the principal Syrians in Cesarea persuaded Bunhus who was Nero s tutor and secre tary for his Greek epistles by giving him a great sum of mo ney to disannul that equality of the Jewish privileges of citi zens which they hitherto enjoyed So Burrhus by his solici tations obtained leave of the emperor that an ejpistle should be written to that purpose This epistle became the occasion of the following miseries that befel our nation  for when the Jews of Cesarea were informed of the contents of this epistle to the Syrians they were more disorderly than before till a war was kindled   10 Upon Festus s coming into Judea it happened that Tudea was afflicted by the robbers while all the villages were set on fire  The wickedness here was very peculiar and extraordinary that the high priests should so oppress their brethren the priests as to starve the poorest of them to death See the like presently ch ix sect a Such fatal crimes are co yetcusness s nd tyranny in the clergy as well as in the laity in all ages Chap VIII AWTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 181 fire and plundered by them And then it was that the Sicarii as they were called who were robbers grew numerous They made use of small swords not much different in length from the Psrsian acwacte but somewhat crooked and like the Ro man note or sickles as they were called  and from these weapons these robbers got their denomination  and with those weapons they slew a great many for they mingled themselves among the multitude at their festivals when they were come up in crowds from all pans to the city to worship God as we said before and easily slew those that they had a mind to slay They also came frequently upon the villages belonging to their ene mies vvith their weapons and plundered them and set them on fire So Festus sent forces both horsemen and footmen to fall upon those that had been seduced by a certain impostor who pro mised them deliverance and freedom from the miseries they were under if they would but follow him as far as the wilderness Accordingly those forces that were sent destroyed both him that had deluded them and those that were his followers also 11 About the same time king Agrippa built himself a very large dining room in the royal palace at Jerusalem near to the portico Now this palace had been erected of old by the chil dren of Asamoneus and was situate upon an elevation and afford ed a most delightful prospect to those that had a mind to take a view of the city which prospect was desired by the king and there he could lie down and eat and thence observe what was done in the temple  vjhieh thing when the chief men of Jerusalem saw they were very much displeased at it for it was not agreeable to the institutions of our country or law that what was done in the temple should be viewed by others espe cially what belonged to the sacrifices They therefore erected a wall upon the uppermost building which belonged to the inner court of the temple towards the west which wall when it was built did not only intercept the prospect of the dining room in the palace but also of the western cloisters that belonged to the outer court of the temple also where it was that the Romans kept guards for the temple at the festivals At these doings both king Agrippa and principally Festus the procurator were much displeased  and Festus ordered them to pull the wall down again  but the Jews petitioned him to give him leave to send an ambassage about this matter to Nero  for they said they could not endure to live if any part of the temple should be de molished  and when Festus had given them leave so to do they sent ten of their principal men to Nero as also Ismael the high priest and Helcias the keeper of the sacred treasure And when Nero had heard what they had to say he not only for gave 182 ANTIQJJITIES OF THE JEWS Book XX gave  them what they had already done but also gave them leave to let the wall they had built stand This was granted them in order to gratify Poppea Nero s wife who was a re ligious woman and had requested these favours of Nero and who gave order to the ten ambassadors to go their way home  but retained Helcias and Ismael as hostages with herself As soon as the king heard this news he gave the high priesthood to Joseph who was called Cabi the son of Simon formerly high priest CHAP IX Concerning Albinus under whose procuratorship James was slain  as also what edifices were built by Agrippa Â 1 A ND now Caesar upon hearing the death of Festus sent Albinus into Judea as procurator But the king de prived Joseph of the high priesthood and bestowed the succession to that dignity on the son of Ananus who was also himself called Ananas Now the report goes that this eldest Ananus proved a most fortunate man i for he had five sons who had all perform ed the office of an high priest to God and who had himself en joyed that dignity a long time formerly which had never hap pened to any other of our high priests But this younger Ananus who as we have told you already took the high priesthood was a bold man in his temper and very insolent he was also of the sect of the Sadducees f who are very rigid in judging offenders above all the rest of the Jews as we have already observed  when therefore Ananus was of this disposition he thought he had now a proper opportunity to exercise his authority Fes tus was now dead and Albinus was put upon the road  so he assembled the sanhedrim of judges and brought before them the brother of Jesus who was called Christ whose name was fames and some others or some of his companions And when he had formed an accusation against them as breakers of the  We have here one eminent example of Nero s mildness and goodness in his government towards the Jews during the five first years of his reign so famous in antiquity we have perhaps another in Josephus s own Life sect 3 and a third though of a very different nature here in sect 9 just before However both the generous acts of kindness were obtained of Nero by his queen Poppea who was a religious lady and perhaps privately a Jewish proselyte and so were not owing entirely to Nero s own goodness t It hence evidently appears that Sadducees might be high priests in the days of Josephus and that these Sadducees were usually very severe and inexorable judges while the Pharisees were much milder and more merciful as appears by Iceland s instances in his note on this place and on Josephus s Life sect 34 and those taken from the New Testament from Josephus himself and from the rab bins nor do we meet with any Sadducees later than this high priest in all Jost phes Chap IX ANTTQtJITlES OF THE JEWS 183 the law he delivered them to be stoned  but as for those who seemed the most equitable of the citizens and such as were the most uneasy at the breach of the laws they disliked what was done  they also sent to the king Agrippa desiring him to send to Ananus that he should act so no more for that what he had already done was not to be justified  nay  some of them went also to meet Albinus as he was upon his journey from Alex andria and informed him that it was not lawful for Ananus to assemble a sanhedrim without his consent Whereupon Al binus complied with what they said and wrote in anger to Ananus and threatened that he would bring him to punishment for what he had done  on which king Agrippa took the high priesthood from him when he had ruled but three months and made Jesus the son of Damneus high priest 2 Now as soon as Albinus was come to the city of Jerusalem he used all his endeavours and care that the country might be kept in peace and this by destroying many of the Sicarii But as for the high priest Ananias f he increased in glory every day and this to a great degree and had obtained the favour and esteem of the citi ens in a signal manner  for he was a great hoarder up of money  he therefore cultivated the friendship of Albinus and of the high priest Jesus by making them pre sents  he also had servants who were very wicked who joined themselves to the boldest sort of the people and went to the threshing floors and took away the tithes that belonged to the priests by violence and did not refrain from beating such as would not give these tithes to them So the other high priests acted in the like manner as did those his servants without any one s being able to prohibit them so that some of the priests that of old were  Of this condemnation of James the Just and its causes as also that he did not die till long afterwards see Prim Christ Revived Vol III ch 43 â 46 The sanhedrim condemned our Saviour but could not put him to deaih without the approbation of the Roman procurator nor could therefore Ananias and his sanhedrim do more here since they never had Albinus s approbation for the putting this James to death t This Ananias was not the son of Nebedeus as I take it but he who was called Annas or Ananus the elder the 9th in the catalogue and who had been esteemed high priest for a long time and besides Caiaphas his son in law had five of his own sons high priests after him which were those of numbers 11 14 15 17 14 in the foregoing catalogue Nor ought we to pass slightly over what Josephus here says of Annas or Ananias that he was high priest a long time be fore his children were so  he was the son of Seth and is set down first for high priest in the foregoing catalogue under number 9 He was made by Quirinus and continued till Ismael the loth in number for about 23 years which long duration of his high priesthood joined to the successions of his son in law and five children of his own made him a sort of perpetual high priest and was pen haps the occasion that former high priests kept their titles ever afterwards i fa  believe it is hardly met with before him 184  ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS  Book XX were wont to be supported with those tithes died for want of food 3 But now the Sicarii went into the city by night just be fore the festival which was now at hand and took the scribe belonging to the governor of the temple whose name was Elea s art who was the son of Ananus Ananias the high priest and bound him and carried him away with them  after which th r sent to Ananias and said that they would send the scribe to him if he would persuade Albinus to release ten of those prisoners which he had caught of their party so Ananias was plainly forced to persuade Albinus and gained his request of him This was the beginning of greater calamities  for the robbers perpe tually contrived to catch some of Ananias s servants and when they had taken them alive they would not let them go till they thereby recovered some of their own Sicarii And as they were again become no small in number they grew bold and were a great affliction to the whole country 4 About this time it was that king Agrippa built Cesarea Philippi larger tha i it was before and in honour of Nero named it Neronias And when he had built a theatre at Berytus with vast expences he bestowed on them shows to be exhibited every year and spent therein many ten thousand drachmae  he also gave the people a largess of corn and distributed oil among them and adorned the entire city with statues of his own donation and with original images made by ancient hands nay he almost trans ferred all that was most ornamental in his own kingdom thither This made htm more than ordinarily hated by his subjects  be cause he took those things away that belonged to them to adorn a foreign city And now Jesus the son of Gamaliel became the successor of Jesus the son of Damneus in the high priesthood which the king had taken from the other  on which account a sedition arose between the high pr iests with regard to one an other  for they got together bodies of the boldest sort of the people and frequently came from reproaches to throwing of stones at each other But Ananias was too hard for the rest by his riches which enabled him to gain those that were most ready to receive Costobarus also and Saulus did themselves get to gether a multitude of wicked wretches and this because they were of the royal family  and so they obtained favour among them because of their kindred to Agrippa  but still they used violence with people and were very ready to plunder those that were weaker than themselve s And from that it principally came to pass that our city was greatly disordered and that all things grew worse and worse among us   5 But when Albinus heard that Gcssins Floras was coming to Chap IX ANTIQJHTIES OF THE JEWS 185 to succeed him he wa s desirous to appear to do somewhat that might be grateful to the pefople of Jerusalem  so he brought out all those prisoners who seemed to him to be the most plainly worthy of death and brdef d fherii to be put to death according ly But as to those who had been put into prison on some tri fling occasions he took nioney of them and dismissed them  bv which means the prisons were emptied but the country was filled with robbers  6 Now as many ef the Levites which is a tribe of ours as were singers of hymns persuaded the king to assemble a sanhe drim and to give them leave to wear linen garments as well as the priests  for they said that this would be a work worthy the times of his government that he might have a memorial of such  a novelty as being his doing Nor did they fail of obtaining their desire  for the king with the suffrages of those that canit into the sanhedrim granted the singers of hymns this privilege that they might lay aside their former garments and wear such a linen one as they desired  and as a pan of this tribe ministered in the temple he also permitted them to learn those hymns as they had besought him for  Now all this was contrary to the laws of our country whichy whenever they have been transgress ed we have never been able to avoid the punishment of such transgressions 7 And now it was that the temple j was finished So when the people saw that the workmen were unemployed who were above eighteen thousand and that they receiving no wages were in want because they had earned their bread by their la bours about the temple and while they were unwilling to keep them by the treasures that were there deposited out of fear of f their being carried away by the Romans and while they had a regard to the making provision for the workmen they had a mind to expend those treasures upon them for if any one of them did but labour for a single hour tye received his pay im mediately  so they persuaded him to rebuild the eastern clois ters These cloisters belonged to the outer coart and were si tuated in a deep valley and had walls that reached four hundred cubits in length and were built of square and very white stones the length of each of which stones was twenty cubits and their height six cubits This was the work of king Solomon  VOL III A a who  This insolent petition of some of the Levites to wear the sacerdotal gar ments when they sung hymns to God in the temple was very probably owing to the great depression and contempt the haughty high priests had nnwbrought their brethren the priests i nto of which see chap viii sect S and chap ix sect 2  Of this

entire temple But king Agrippa who had the care of the temple committed to him by Claudius Caesar considering that it is easy to demolish any building but hard to build it up again and that it was particularly hard to do it to these cloisters which would require a considerable time and great sums of money he denied the petitioners their request about that matter  but he did not obstruct them when they de sired the city might be paved with white stone He also depri ved Jesus the son of Gamaliel of the high priesthood and gave it to Matthias the son of Theophilus under whom the Jews war with the Romans took its beginning CHAP X jtn enumeration of tie Higl prifsts  1 A ND now I think it proper and agreeable to this his  tory to give an account of our high priests  how they began who those are which are capable of that dignity and how many of them there had been at the end of the war In the first place therefore history informs us that Aaron the brother of Moses officiated to God as an high priest and that after his death his sons succeeded him immediately  and that ihis dignity hath been continued down from them all to their posterity Whence it is a custom of our country that no one should take the high priesthood of God but he who is of the blood of Aaron while every one that is of another stock though he were a king can never obtain that high priesthood Ac cordingly the number of all the high priests from Aaron of whom we have spoken already as of the first of them until Pha nas who was made high priest during the war by the seditious was eighty three  of whom thirteen officiated as high priests in the wilderness from the days of Moses while the tabernacle was standing until the people came into Judea when king So lomon erected the temple to God  for at the first they held the high priesthood till the end of their life although afterward they had successors while they were alive Now these thirteen who were the descendants of two of the sons of Aaron received this dignity by succession one after another for their form of government was an aristocracy and after that a monarchy and in the third place the government was regal Now the number of years during the rule of these thirteen from the day when our fathers departed out of Egypt under Moses their leader until the building of that temple which king Solomon erected at  Of these cloisters of

twelve After those thir teen high priests eighteen took the high priesthood at Jerusa lem one in succession to another from the days of king Solo mon until Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon made an expedi tion against that city and burnt the temple and removed our nation into Babylon and then took Josadek the high priest cap tive  the times of these high priests were four hundred sixty six years six months and ten days while the Jews were still un der the regal government But after the term of seventy years captivity under the Babylonians Cyrus king of Persia sent the Jews from Babylon to their own land again and gave them leave to rebuild their temple  at which time Jesus the son of Josadek took the high priesthood over the captives when they were re turned home Now he and his posterity who were in all fif teen until king Antiochus Eupator were under a democratical government for fourteen years  and then the forementioned An tiochus and Lysia the general of his army deprived Onias who was also called Menelaus of the high priesthood and slew him at Berea and driving away the son of Onias the third put Ja cimus into the place of the high priest one that was indeed of the stock of Aaron but not of that family of Onias On which ac count Onias who was the nephew of Onias that was dead and bore the same name with his father came into Egypt and got into the friendship of Ptolemy Philometor and Cleopatra his wife and persuaded them to make him the high priest of th t temple which he built to God in the prefecture of Heliopolis and this in imitation of that at Jerusalem  but as for that tem ple which was built in Egypt we have spoken of it frequently already Now when Jacimus had retained the priesthood three years he died and there was no one that succeeded him that the city continued seven years without an high priest â but then the posterity of the sons of Asamoneus who had the government of the nation conferred upon them when they had beaten the Macedonians in war appointed Jonathan to be their high priest who ruled over them seven years And when he had been slain by the treacherous contrivance of Trypho as we have related somewhere Simon his brother took the high priesthood  and when he was destroyed at a feast by the treachery of his son in law his own son whose name xvasllyrcanus succeeded him af ter he had held the high priesihood one year longer than his bro ther This Hyrcanus enjoyed that dignity thirty years and died an old man leaving the succession to Judas who was also called Aristobukis whose brother Alexander was his heir  which Ju das died of a sore distemper after he had kept the priesthood to gether with the royal authority  for this Judas was the first that A a 2 put IS8  ASTIOPITIES OF THE JEWS Book XX put on his head a diadem for one year And when Alexander had been both king and high priest twenty seven years he de parted this life and permitted his wife Alexandra to appoint him that should be high priest  so she gave the high priesthood to Hyrcanus but retained the kingdom herself nine years and then departed this life The like duration and no longer did her son Hytcanus enjoy the high priesthood  for after her death his brother Aristobulus fought against him and beat him and de o O   prived him of his principality  and he did himself both reign and perform the office of high priest to God But when he had reigned three years and as many months Pompey came upon him and not only took the city of Jerusalem by force but put him and his children in bonds and sent them to Rome He alsa restored the high priesthood to Hyrcanus and made him governor of the nation but forbade him to wear a diadem This Hyrca nus ruled besides his first nine years twenty four years more when Barzapharnes and Parcorus the generals of the Parthians passed over Euphrates and fought with Hyrcanus and took him alive and made Antigonus the son of Aristobulus king  and  when he had reigned three years and three months Sosius and Herod besieged him and took him when Antony had him brought â to Antioch and slain there Herod was then made king by the Romans but did no longer appoint high priests out of the fami ly of Asamoneus â but made certain men to be so that were of no eminent families but barely of those that were priests except ing that he gave that dignity to Aristobulus for when he had made this Aristobulus the grandson of that Hyrcanus who was then taken by the Parthians and had taken his sister Mariamne to wife he thereby aimed to win the good will of the people who had a kind remembrance of Hyrcanus his grandfather Yet did he afterward out of his fear lest they should all bend their inclinations to Aristobulus put him to death and that by contriving how to have him suffocated as he was swimming at Jericho as we have already related that matter but after this man he never intrusted the high priesthood to the posterity of the sons of Asamoneus Archelaus also Herod s son did like his father in the appointment of the high priests as did the Ro mans also who took the government over the Jews into their hands afterward Accordingly the number of the high priests from the days of Herod until the day when Titus took the tem ple and the city and burnt them were in all twenty eight the time also that belonged to them was an hundred and seven years Some of these were the political governors of the people under the reign of Herod and under the reign of Archelaus his son although after their death the government became an aristocra Chap XT ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWSt cy and the high priests were intrusted with a dominion over the nation And thus much may suffice to be said concerning our high priests CHAP XI Concerning Florus the procurator who necessitated the Jaw to take up arms against the Romans The conclusion  1 IVTOW Gessius Florus who was sent as successor to Albi â â nus by Nero filled Judea with abundance of miseries He was by birth of the city of Claz omenae and brought along with him his wife Cleopatra by whose friendship with Poppea Nero s wife he obtained this government who was no way dif ferent from him in wickedness This Florus was so wicked and so violent in the use of his authority that the Jews took Albi nus to have been comparatively their benefactor  so excessive Were the mischiefs that he brought upon them For Albinus concealed his wickedness and was careful that it might not be discovered to all men but Gessius Florus as though he had been sent on purpose to shew his crimes to every body made a pompous ostentation of them to our nation as never omitting any sort of violence nor any unjust sort of punishment for he was not to be moved by pity and never was satisfied with any degree of gain that came in his way  nor had he any more re gard to great than to small acquisitions but became a partner with the robbers themselves For a great many fell then into that practice without fear as having him for their security and de pending on him that he would save them harmless in their par ticular robberies  so that there were no bounds set to the nation miseries  but the unhappy Jews when they were nqt able to bear the devastations which the robbers made among them were all under a necessity of leaving their own habitations and of flying away as hoping to dwell more easily any where else in the world among foreigners than in their own country And what need I say any more upon this head since it was this Florus who ne cessitated us to take up arms against the Romans while we thought it better to be destroyed at once than by little and little Now this war began in the second year of the government of Florus and the twelfth year of the reign of Nero 3ut then what actions we were forced to do or what miseries we were enabled to suffer may be accurately known by such as will peruse those books which I have written about the Jewish war 2 I shall now therefore make an end here of my Antiquities after the conclusion of which events I began to write that account of the war  and thess Antiquities contain what hath been deli â  vered 190 ANTIQUITIES or THE JEWS Book XX vered down to us from the original creation of man until the twelfth year of the reign of Nero as to what hath befallen the Jews as well in Egypt as in Syria and in Palestine and what we have suffered from the Assyrians and Babylonians and what afflictions the Persians and Macedonians and after them the Romans have brought upon us  for I think I may say that I have composed this history with sufficient accuracy in all things I have attempted to enumerate those high priests that we have had during the interval of two thousand years  I have also carried down the succession of our kings and related their actions and political administration without considerable errors as also the power of our monarchs  and all according to what is written in our sacred books  for this it was that I pro mised to do in the beginning of this history And I am so bold as to say now I have so completely perfected the work I pro posed to myself to do that no other person whether he were a Jew or a foreigner had he ever so great an inclination to it could so accurately deliver these accounts to the Greeks as is done in these books For those of my own nation freely ac knowledge that I far exceed them in the learning belonging to Jews  I have also taken a great deal of pains to obtain the learn ing of the Greeks and understand the elements of the Greek lan guage although I have so long accustomed myself to speak our own tongue that I cannot pronounce Greek with sufficient exact ness  for our nation does not encourage those that learn the lan guages of many nations and so adorn their discourses with the smoothness of their periods  because they look upon this sort of accomplishment as common not only to all sorts of free men but to as many of the servants as please to learn them But they give him the testimony of being a wise man who isfullvacquaint ed with our laws and is able to interpret their meaning  on which account as there have been many who have done their en deavours with great patience to obtain this learning there have yet hardly been so many as two or three that have succeeded therein who were immediately well rewarded for their pains And now it will not be perhaps an invidious thing if I treat briefly of my own family and of the actions of my own life while there is still living such as can either prove what 1 say to be false or can attest that it is true  with which accounts I shall put an end to these Antiquities which are contained in twenty books and sixty thousand verses And if God  permit me I will  Chap XI ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS 191 will briefly run over this war again with what befel us therein to this very day which is the thirteenth year of the reign of Caesar Domitian and the fifty sixth year of my own life I have also an intention to write three books concerning our Jewish opinions about God and his essence and about our laws why ac cording to them some things are permitted us to do and others are prohibited THE where whether he performed what he now intended or not Some of the rea sons of this design of his might possibly be his observation of the many errors he had been guilty of in the two first of those seven books of the War which were written when he was comparatively young and less acquainted with the Jewish antiquities than he now was and in which abridgement we might have hoped to find those many passages which himself as well as those several passa ges which others refer to as written by him but which are not extant in his present works However since many of his own references to what he had written elsewhere as well as most of his own errors belong to such early times as could not well come into this abridgement of the Jewish war i and since none of those that quote things not now extant in his works including himself as welt as others ever cite any such abridgement 1 am forced rather to suppose that he never did publish any such work at all I mean as distinct from his own life written by himself for an appendix to these Antiquities and this at least seven years after these Antiquities were finished Nor indeed does it appear to me that Josephus ever published that other work here mentioned as intended by him for the public also I mean the three or four books concerning Cod and his Â settee and concerning the Jewish laws why according to them some things â were permitted the Jews and others prohibited which last seems to be the same work which Josephus had also promised  God pirmitttd at the conclusion of his preface to these Antiquities nor do 1 suppose that Tie ever published any of them The death of all his friends at court Vespasian Titus and Domitian and the coining of those he had no acquaintance with to the crown I mean fc erva and Trajan together with his removal from Rome to Judea with what followed it might easily interrupt such his intentions and prevent his publica tion of those works Ii  r i i ii  L I F E        or   v FLAVIUS JOSEPHUS   1 HPHE family from which I am derived is not an ignoble 4i one but hath descended all along from the priests  and as nobility among several people is of a different origin so with us to be of a sacerdotal dignity is an indication of the splendour of a family Now I am not only sprung from a sacerdotal far mily in general but from the first of the twenty four courses and as among us there is not only a considerable difference be tween one family of each course and another 1 am of the chief family of that first course also nay farther by my mother I am of the royal blood  for the children of Asamoneus from whom that family was derived had both the office of the high priesthood and the dignity of a king for a long time together I will accordingly set down my progenitors in order My grand father s father was named Simon with the addition of Psellus  he lived at the same time with that son of Simon the high priest who first of all the high priests was named Hyrcanus This Si mon Psellus had nine sons one of which was Matthias called Ephlias  he married the daughter of Jonathan the high priest which Jonathan was the first of the sons of Asamoneus who was high priest and was the brother of Simon the high priest also This Matthias had a son called Matthias Curtus and that in the first year of the government of Hyrcanus  his son s name was Joseph born in the ninth year of the reign of Alexandra his son Matthias was born in the tenth year of the reign of Ar chelaus  We may hence correct the error of the Latin copy of the second book against Apion sect 7 8 for the Greek is there lost which says there were then only four tribes of courses of the priests instead of twenty four Nor is this testimony to be disregarded as if Josephus there contradicted what he had affirmed here i because even the account there given better agrees to twenty four than to four courses while he says that each of those courses contained above 5000 men which multiplied by only four will make not more than 20 000 priests whereas the number 120 000 as multiplied by 14 seems much the most probable they being about one tenth of the whole people even after the capti vity See Ezra ii 36â 30â Nehem vii 39 â 42 1 Esd v 24 25 with Ezra ii 64 Nehem vii 66 1 Esd v 41 Nor will this common reading or notion of but four courses of priests agree with Josephus s own farther assertion else where Antiq B VII ch xiv sect 7 that David s partition of the priests into twenty four courses had continued to that day THE LIFE OF FLAVIUS IOSEPHUS 193 chelaus  as was I born to Matthias on the first year of the rcigtl of Caius Caesar I have three sons  Hyrcanus the eldest was born on the fourth year of the reign of Vespasian as was Justus born on the seventh and Agrippa on the ninth Thus have I set down the genealogy of my family as I have found it descri bed in the public records and so bid adieu to those who ca lumniate me as of a lower original 2 Now my father Matthias was not only eminent on account of his nobility but had a higher commendation on account of his righteousness and was in great reputation in Jerusalem the greatest city we have I was myself brought up with my bro ther whose name was Matthias for he was my own brother by both father and mother  and I made mighty proficiency in the improvements of my learning and appeared to have both a great memory and understanding Moreover when I was a child and about fourteen years of age I was commended by all for the love 1 had to learning  on which account the high priests and principal men of the city came then frequently to me toge ther in order to know my opinion about the accurate understand ing of points of the law And when I was about sixteen years old I had a mind to make trial of the several sects that were among us These sects are three  the first is that of the Pharisees the second that of the Sadducees and the third that of the Essens as we have frequently told you  for I thought that by this means I might chuse the best if I were once acquainted with them all so I contented myself with hard fare and underwent great diffi culties and went through them all f Nor did I content myself with these trials only  but when I was informed that one whose name was Banus lived in the desart and used no other cloathing than grew upon trees and had no other food than what grew of its own accord and bathed himself in cold water frequently both by night and by day in order to preserve his chastity 1 imita ted him in those things md continued with him three years f VOL III B b So  An eminent example of the care of the Jews about their genealogies espe  eially as to the priests See Contr Ap B I ch 7 t When Joseplms here says that from sixteen to nineteen or for three years he made trial of the three Jewish sects the Pharisees the Sadducecs and the Essens and yet says presently in all our copies that he stayed besides with one particular ascetick called Eanus ira iu ru with him and this still before he was nineteen there is little room left lor his trial of the thi ee other sects I suppose therefore that for axf aura uiitb him the old reading might be Â Â iu vtil with them which is a very small emendation and takes away the diffi culty before us Nor is Dr Hudson s conjecture hinted at by Mr H all in his pre face to the doctor s edition of Josephus at all improbable that this Banus by this his description might well be a follower of John the Baptist and that from him Josephus might easily imbibe such notions as afterward prepared him to have a favourable opinion about Jesus Christ himself who was attested to by John the Bsptist 194 THE LIFE OF FLAVICS JOSEFHUS So when I had accomplished my desires I returned back to the city being now nineteen years old and began to conduct myself according to the rules of the sect of the Pharisees which is of kin to the sect of the Stoics as the Greeks call them 3 But when I was in the twenty sixth year of my age it happened that 1 took a voyage to Rome and this on the Occasion which I shall now describe At the time when Felix was pro curator of Judea there were certain priests of my acquaintance and very excellent persons they were whom on a small and trif ling occasion he had put into bonds and sent to Rome to plead their cause before Caesar These I was desirous to procure de liverance for and that especially because I was informed that they were not unmindful of piety towards God even under their afflictions but supported themselves with figs and nuts Ac cordingly I came to Rome though it were through a great num ber of hazards by sea  for as our ship was drowned in the A driatic sea we that were in it being about six hundred in num ber f swam for our lives all the night when upon the first ap pearance of the day and upon our sight of a ship of Cyrene I and some others eighty in all by God s providence prevented the rest and were taken up into the other ship And when I had thus escaped and was come to Dicearchia which the Italians call Puteoli I became acquainted with Aliturius an actor of plays and much beloved by Nero but a Jew by birth  through his interest became known to Poppea Caesar s wife and took care as soon as possible to entreat her to procure that the priests might be set at liberty And when besides this favour I had obtained many presents from Poppea I returned home again 4 And now I perceived innovations were already begun and that there were a great many very much elevated in hopes of a revolt from the Romans 1 therefore endeavoured to put a stop to these tumultuous persons and persuaded them to change their minds  and laid before their eyes against whom it was that they were going to fight and told them that they were inferior to the Romans not only in martial skill but also in good fortune and de sired them not rashly and after the most foolish manner to bring on the dangers of the most terrible mischiefs upon their country upon their families and upon themselves And this I said with vehement  We may note here that religions men among the Jews or at least those that were priests were sometimes asceticks also and like Daniel and his com panions in Babylon Dan i 8 â 16 ate no flesh but Jigs and nuts c only This was like the ipâ yi or austere diets of the Christian asceticks in Passion week Constitut V iS t It hath been thought the number of Paul and his companions on ship board Acts xxvii 38 which aie 776 in our copies are too many whereas wc find here that Josephus and his companions a very few years after the other were about 60s THE LIFE OF FLAVIUS JOSEPHUS 195 vehement exhortation because I foresaw that the end of such a war would be most unfortunate to us But I could not persuade them  for the madness of desperate men was quite too hard for me 5 I was then afraid lest by inculcating these things so often I should incur their hatred and their suspicions as if I were of our enemies party and should run into the danger of being sei zed by them and slain  since they were already possessed of Antonia which was the citadel  so I retired into the inner court of the temple Yet did I go out of the temple again after Ma nahem and the principal of the band of robbers were put to death when I abode among the high priests and the chief of the Pha risees But no small fear seized upon us when we aw the peo ple in arms while we ourselves knew not what we should do and were not able to restrain their seditions However as the danger was directly upon us we pretended that we were of the same opinion with them but only advised them to be quiet for the present and to let the enemy go away still hoping that Gessius Floras would not be long ere he came and th t with great forces and so put an end to these seditious proceedings 6 But upon his coming and fighting hewasbeaten and a great many of those that were with him fell And this disgrace which Gessius with Casfius received became the calamity of our whole nation  for those that were fond of the war were so far elevated with this success that they had hopes of finally conquering the Romans Of which war another occasion was ministered  â which was this Those that dwelt in the neighbouring cities of Syria seized upon such Jews as dwelt among them with their wives and children and slew them when they had not the least occasion of complaint against them  for they did neither attempt any innovation or revolt from the Romans nor had they given any marks of hatred or treacherous designs towards the Syrians But what was done by the inhabitants of Scythopolis was the most impious and most highly criminal of all   for when the Jews their enemies came upon them from without they forced the Jews that were among them to bear arms against their own countrymen which it is unlawful for us to do f and when by their assistance they had joined battle with those that attacked them and had beaten them after that victory they forgot the B b 2 assurances Â See Of the War B II ch xviii sect 3  The Jews might collect this unlawfulness of fighting against their brethren iram that law of Moses Levit xix 16  Thou i halt not s arul against the blood â â of thy neighbour  and that ver 17  Thou shalt nor avenge nor btar any  grudge against the children of thy people but ihou shalt love ihy neighbour as  thvselt as well as from many other places in the IV Mtciich and Prophets See Aatig B VHI xh viii sect 3 196 THE LIFE OF FLAVIUS JOSEFHUS assurances they had given these their fellow citizens and confe derates and slew them all being in number many ten thousand l 3 000 The like miseries were undergone by those Jews that were the inhabitants of Damascus But we have given a more accurate account of these things in the books of the Jew ish war I only mention them now because I would demon strate to my readers that the Jews war with the Romans was not voluntary but that for the main they were forced by ne cessity to enter into it 7 So when Gessiushad been beaten as we have said already the principal men of Jerusalem seeing that the robbers and in novators had arms in great plenty and fearing lest they while they were unprovided of arms should be in subjection to their enemies which also carne to be the case afterward and being informed that all Galilee had not yet revolted from the Romans but that some part of it was still quiet they sent me and twq others of the priests who were men of excellent characters Jozar and Judas in order to persuade the ill men there to lay down theityarms and to teach them this lesson that it were betler to have those arms reserved for the most courageous men that the nation had than to be kept there  for that it had been resolved that those our best men should always have their arms ready against futurity but still so that they should wait to see what the Romans would do 8 When I had therefore received these instructions I came into Galilee and found the people of Sepphorisin no small agony about their country by reason that the Galileans had resolved to plunder it on account oi the friendship they had with the Ro mans and because they had given their right hand and made a league with Cestius Gallus the president of Syria But I de livered them all out of the fear they were in and persuaded the multitude to deal kindly with them and permitted them to send to those that were their own hostages with Gessius to Dora which is a city of Phenicia as often as he pleased  though I still found the inhabitants of Tiberias ready to take arms and that on the occasion following  9 There were three factions in this city The first was com posed of men of worth and gravity  of these Julius Capellus was the head Now he as well as all his companions Herod the son of Miarus and Herod the son of Gamalus and Compsus the son of Compsus for as to Compsus s brother Crispus who had once been governor of the city under the great king  Agrip pa he was beyond Jordan in his own possessions  all these   persons  That this Herod Agrippa the father was of old called a Great King as here appears by his coins still remaining  to which Havtrca rp refers us THE LIFE OF FLAVJDS JOSEFHUS 197 persons before named gave their advice that the city should then continue in their allegiance to the Romans and to the king But Pistus who was guided by his son Justus did not acquiesce in that resolution  otherwise he was himself naturally of a good and virtuous character But the second faction was composed of the most ignoble persons and was determined for war But as for Justus the son of Pistus who was the head of the third faction although he pretended to be doubtful about going to war yet was he really desirous of innovation as supposing that he should gain power to himself by the change of affairs He there fore came into the midst of them and endeavoured to inform the multitude That  the city Tiberias had ever been a city of  Galilee and that in the days of Herod the tetrarch who had  built it it had obtained the principal place and that he had or  dered that the city Sepphoris should be subordinate to the city  Tiberias  that they had not lost this pre eminence even under  Agrippa the father but had retained it until Felix was procu  rator of Judea But he told them that now they had been so  unfortunate as to be made a present by Nero to Agrippa jn f nior  and that upon Sepphoris s submission of itself to the  Romans that was become the capital city of Galilee and that  the royal treasury and the archives were now removed from  them When he had spoken these things and a great many more against Agrippa in order to provoke the people to a revolt lie added That  this was the time for them to take arms and  join with the Galileans as their confederates whom they might  command and who would now willingly assist them out of the  hatred they bare to the people of Sepphoris because they pre  served their fidelity to the Romans and to gather a great ntun  ber of forces in order to punish them And as he said this he exhorted the multitude to go to war  for his abilities lay in making harangues to the people and in being too hard in his speeches for such as opposed him though they advised what was more to their advantage and this by his craftiness and his falla cies for he was not unskilful in the learning of the Greeks and in dependence on that skill it was that he undertook te write an history of these affairs as aiming by this way of ha ranguing to disguise the truth But as to this man rmd how ill were his character and conduct of life and he and his brother were in great measure the authors of our destruction I shall give the reader an account in the progress of my narration So when Justus had by his persuasions prevailed with the citizens of Tiberias to take arms nay and had foreed a great many so to do against their will he went out and set the villages that be longed IPS TCHE LIFE OF FLAVIUS JOSEPHtJS longed to Gadara and Hippos on fire  which villages were si tuated on the borders of Tiberias and of the region of Scytho polis 10 And this was the state Tiberias was now in But as for Gischala its affairs were thus  When John the son of Livi saw some of the citizens much elevated upon their revolt from the Romans he laboured to restrain them and entreated them that they would keep their allegiance to them But he could not gain his purpose although he did his endeavours to the ut most  for the neighbouring people of Gadara and Gabara and Sogana with the Tyrians got together a great army and fell upon Gischala and took Gischala by force and set it on fire j and when they had entirely demolished it they returned home Upon which John was so enraged that he armed all his men and joined battle with the people forementioned and rebuilt Gischala after a manner better than before and fortified it with walls for its future security 11 But Gamala persevered in its allegiance to the Romans for the reason following  Philip the son of Jacimus who was their governor under king Agrippa had been unexpectedly pre served when the royal palace at Jerusalem had been besieged  but as he fled away had fallen into another danger and that was of being killed by Manahem and the robbers that were with him  but certain Babylonians who were of his kindred and were then in Jerusalem hindered the robbers from executing their design So Philip staid there four days and fled away on the fifth ha ving disguised himself with fictitious hair that he might not be discovered  and when he was come to one of the villages to him belonging but one that was situated at the borders of the citadel of Gamala he sent to some of those that were under him and commanded them to come to him But God himself hindered that his intention and this for his own advantage also  for had it not so happened he had certainly perished For a fever having seized upon him immediately he wrote to Agrippa and Bernice and gave them to one of his freed men to carry them to Varus who at this time was procurator of the kingdom which the king and his sister had intrusted them withal while they were gone to Berytus with an intention of meeting Gessius When Varus had received these letters of Philip and had learned that he was pre served he was very uneasy at it as supposing that he should ap pear useless to the king and his sister now Philip was come He therefore produced the carrier of the letters before the multitude and accused him of forging the same  and said that he spake falsely when he related that Philip was at Jerusalem fighting 2 THE LIFE OP FLAVHJS JOSEPHU9 193 tnong the Jews against the Romans So he slew him And when this freed man of Philip did not return again Philip was doubtful what should be the occasion of his stay and sent a se cond messenger with letters that he might upon his return in fcrrn him what had befallen the other that had been sent before and why he tarried so long Varus accused this messenger also when he came of telling a falsehood and slew him For he was puffed up by the Syrians that were at Cesarea and had great ex pectations  for they said that Agrippa would be slain by the Ro mans for the crimes which the Jews had committed and that he should himself take the government as derived from their kings  for Varus was by the confession of all of the royal family as be ing a descendant of Sohemus who had enjoyed a tetrarchy about Libanus  for which reason it was that he was puffed up and kept the letters to himself He contrived also that the king should not meet with those writings by guarding all the passes lest any one should escape and inform the king what had been done He moreover slew many of the Jews in order to gratify the Syrians of Cesarea He had a mind also to join with the Trachonites in Batanea and to take up arms and make an assault upon the Babylonian Jews that were at Ecbatana for that was the name they went by He therefore called to him twelve of the Jews of Cesarea of the best character and ordered them to go to Ecbalana and inform their countrymen who dwelt there that Varus hath heard that  you intend to march against the  king  but not believing that report he hath sent us to per  suade you to lay down your arms and that this compliance  will be a sign that he did well not to give credit to those that  raised the report concerning you He also enjoined them to send seventy of their principal men to make a defence for them as to the accusation laid against them So when the twelve messengers came to their countrymen at Ecbatana and found that they had no designs of innovation at all they persuaded them to send the seventy men also  who not at all suspecting what would come sent them accordingly So these seventy  went down to Cesarea together with the twelve  ambassadors where Varus met them with the king s forces and slew them all together with the twelve ambassadors and made an ex pedition against the Jews of Ecbatana But one there was of the seventy who escaped and made haste to inform the Jews of their coming  upon which they took their arms with their wives and children and retired to the citadel at Gamala leaving their own villages full of alll sorts of good things and having many ten thousands of cattle therein When Philip was informed of these things  The famous Jevrhh numbers of twelve and seventy are here remarkaWe Â 00 THE LIFE OF FLAVIUS JOSEPHUS things he also came to the citadel of Gamala  and when he was come the multitude cried aloud and desired him to resume the government and to make an expedition against Varus and the Syrians of Cesarea for it was reported that they had slain the king But Philip restrained their zeal and put them in mind of the benefits the king had bestowed upon them  and told them how powerful the Romans were and said it was not for their advantage to make war with them  and at length he prevailed with them But now whtn the king was acquainted with Va rus s design which was to cut off the Jews of Cesarea being many ten thousands with their wives and children and all in one day he called to him Equiculus Modius and sent him to be Varus s successor as we have elsewhere related But still Philip kept possession of the citadel of Gamala and of the country adjoining to it which thereby continued in their alle giance to the Romans â 12 Now as soon as I was come into Galilee and had learned this state of things by the information of such as told me of them I wrote to the sanhedrim at Jerusalem about them and required their direction what 1 should do Their direction was that I should continue there and that if my fellow legates were will ing I should join with them in the care of Galilee But those my fellow legates having gotten great riches from those tithes which as priests were then dues and were given to rhem deter mined to return to their own country Yet when 1 desired them to stay so long that we might first settle the public affairs they complied with me So I removed together with them from the city of Sepphoris and came to a certain village called Bethmaus four furlongs distant from Tiberias  and thence I sent messen gers to the senate of Tiberias and desired that the principal men of the city would come to me  and when they were come Justus himself being also with them I told them that I was sent to them by the people of Jerusalem as a legate together with these other priests in order to persuade them to demolish that house which Herod the tetrarch had built there and which had the figures of living creatures in it although our laws have forbidden us to make any such figures and I desired that they would give us leave so to do immediately But for a good while Capellus and the principal men belonging to the city would not give us leave but were at length entirely overcome by us and were induced to be of our opinion So Jesus the son of Sapphias one of those whom we have already mentioned as the leader of a seditious tumult of mariners and poor people prevented us and took with him cer tain Galileans and set the entire palace on fire and thought he should get a great deal of money thereby because he saw some ef the roofs gilt with gold They also plundered a great deal of the THE LIFE OF FLAVIUS JOSEPHU3 201 the furniture which was done without our approbation  for after we had discoursed Capellus and the principal men of the city we departed from Bethmaus and went into the upper Ga lilee But Jesus and his party slew all the Greeks that were inhabitants of Tiberias and as many others as were their ene mies before the war began 13 When 1 understood this state of things I was greatly pro voked and went down to Tiberias and took all the care I could of the royal furniture to recover all that could be recovered from such as had plundered it They consisted of candlesticks made of Corinthian brass and of royal tables and of a great quantity of uncoined silver  and I resolved to preserve whatso ever came to my hand for the king So I sent for ten of the prin cipal men of the senate and for Capellus the son of Antyllus and committed the furniture to them with this charge that they should part with it to nobody else but to myself From thence I and my fellow legates went to Gischala to John as de sirous to know his intentions and soon saw that he was for in novations and had a mind to the principality  for he desired me to give him authority to carry off that corn which belonged to Caesar and lay in the villages of Upper Galilee  and he pretend ed that he would expend what it came to in building the walls of his own city But when I perceived what he endeavoured at and what he had in his mind I said I would not permit him so to do for that I thought either to keep it for the Romans or for myself now I was entrusted with the public affairs there by the people of Jerusalem But when he was not able to prevail with me he betook himself to my fellow legates  for they had no sagacity in providing for futurity and were very ready to take bribes So he corrupted them with money to de cree that all that corn which was within his province should be delivered to him while I who was but one was outvoted by two and held my tongue Then did John introduce another cunning contrivance of his  for he said that those Jews who in habited Cesarea Philippi and were shut up by the order of the king s deputy there had sent to him to desire him that since they had no oil that was pure for their use he would provide a sufficient quantity of such oil that came from the Greeks and thereby transgress their own laws Now this was said by John not out of his regard to religion but out of his most flagrant desire of gain  for he knew that two sextaries were sold with them of Cesarea for one drachma but that at Gischala four score sextaries were sold for four sextaries So he gave order that all the oil which was there should be carried away as ha ving my permission for so doing  which yet I did not grant him VOL III Cc voluntarily 202 THE LIFE OF F1AVIUS IOSEPHU3 voluntarily but only out of fear of the multitude since if I had forbidden him I should have been stoned by them When I had therefore permitted this to be done by John he gained vast sums of money by this his knavery 14 But when I had dismissed my fellow legates and sent them back to Jerusalem I took care to have arms provided and the cities fortified And when 1 had sent for the most hardy among the robbers I saw that it was not in my power to take their arms from them  but I persuaded the multitude to allow them money as pay and told them it was better for them to give them a little willingly rather than to be forced to over look them when they plundered their goods from them And when I had obliged them to take an oath not to come into that country unless they were invited to come or else when they had not their pay given them I dismissed them and charged them neither to make an expedition against the Romans nor against those their neighbours that lay round about them  for my first care was to keep Galilee in peace So I was willing to have the principal of the Galileans in all seventy as hostages for their fidelity but still under the notion of friendship Ac cordingly I made them my friends and companions as I jour neyed and set them to judge causes and with their approba tion it was that I gave my sentences while I endeavoured not to mistake what justice required and to keep my hands clear of all bribery in these determinations 15 I was now about the thirtieth year of my age  in which time of life it is a hard thing for any one to escape the calumnies of the envious although he restrain himself from fulfilling any unlawful desires especially where a person is in great authority Yet did I preserve every woman free from injuries  and as to what presents were offered me I despised them as not standing in need of them Nor indeed would I take those tithes which were due to me as a priest from those that brought them Yet do I confess that I took part of the spoils of those Syrians which inhabited the cities that adjoined to us when I had conquered them and that I sent them to my kindred at Jerusalem although when I twice took Sepphoris by force and Tiberias four times and Gadara once and when I had subdued and taken John who  often laid treacherous snares for me I did not punish with death either him or any of the people fore named as the pro gress of this discourse will shew And on this account I sup pose it was that God  who is never unacquainted with those that  Our Josephus shews both here and every where that he was a most religious person and one that had a deep sense of od and his providence upon his mind and ascribed all his numerous and wonderful escapes and preservations in times  i anger to God s blessing him and taking care of him and this on account of bis acts of piety justice humanity and charity to the Jews his brethren THE LIFE OF FLAVIUS JOSEPHUS 203 that do as they ought to do delivered me still out of the hands of these my enemies and afterward preserved me when I fell into those many dangers which I shall relate hereafter 16 Now the multitude of the Galileans had that great kind ness for me and fidelity to me that when their cities were taken by force and their wives and children carried into slavery they did not so deeply lament for their own calamities as they were solicitous for my preservation But when John saw this he en vied me and wrote to me desiring that I would give him leave to come down and make use of the hot baths of Tiberias for the recovery of the health of his body Accordingly I did not hinder him as having no suspicion of any wicked designs of his  and I wrote to those to whom I had committed the admi nistration of the affairs of Tiberias by name that they should provide a lodging for John and for such as should come with him and should procure him what necessaries soever he should stand in need of Now at this time my abode was in a village of Galilee which is named Cana 17 But when John was come to the city of Tiberias he per suaded the men to revolt from their fidelity to me and to adhere to him  and many of them gladly received that invitation of his as ever fond of innovations and by nature disposed to changes and delighting in seditions  but they were chiefly Justus and his father Pistus that were earnest in their revolt from me and their adherence to John But I came upon them and prevented them  for a messenger had come to me Irom Silas whom I had made governor of Tiberias as I have said already and had told me of the inclinations of the people of Tiberias and advised me to make haste thither  for that if I made any delay the city would come under another s jurisdiction Upon the receipt of this letter of Silas I took two hundred men along with me and travelled all night having sent before a messenger to let the people of Tiberias know that I was coming to them When I came near to the city which was early in the morning the mul titude came out to meet me  and John came with them and sa luted me but in a most disturbed manner as being afraid that my coming was to call him to an account for what I was now sensible he was doing So he in great haste went to his lod ging But when I was in the open place of the city having dis missed the guards I had about me excepting one and ten armed men that were with him I attempted to make a speech to the multitude of the people of Tiberias and standing on a certain elevated place I entreated them not to be so hasty in their re volt  for that such a change in their behaviour would be to their reproach and that they would then justly be suspected by those C c 2  that 20 THE LIFE Of FLAVIUS JOSEPHUS that should be their governors hereafter as if they were not likely to be faithful to them neither 18 But before I had spoken all I designed I heard one of my own domestics bidding me come down  for that it was not a proper time to take care of retaining the good will of the people of Tiberias but to provide for my own safety and escape my enemies there  for John had chosen the most trusty of those armed men that were about him out of those thousand that he had with him and had given them orders when he sent them to kill me having learned that I was alone excepting some of my domestics So those that were sent came as they were ordered and they had executed what they came about had I not leaped down from the elevation I stood on and with one of my guards whose name was James been carried out of the crowd upon the back of one Herod of Tiberias and guided by him down to the lake where I seized a ship and got into it and escaped my enemies unexpectedly and came to Taricheae 19 Now as soon as the inhabitants of that city understood the perfidiousness of the people of Tiberias they were greatly pro voked at them So they snatched up their arms and desired me to be their leader against them  for they said they would avenge their commander s cause upon them They also carried the re port of what had been done to me to all the Galileans and ea gerly endeavoured to irritate them against the people of Tibe rias and desired that vast numbers of them would get together and come to them that they might act in concert with their com mander what should be determined as fit to be done Accord ingly the Galileans came to me in great numbers from all parts with their weapons and besought me to assault Tiberias to take it by force and to demolish it till it lay even with the ground and then to make slaves of its inhabitants with their wives and children Those that were Josephus friends also and had esca ped out of Tiberias gave him the same advice But I did not comply with them thinking it a terrible thing to begin a civil war among them  for I thought that this contention ought not to proceed farther than words  nay I told them that it was not for their own advantage to do what they would have me to do while the Romans expected no other than that we should de stroy one another by our mutual seditions And by saying this I put a stop to the anger of the Galileans 20 But now John was afraid for himself since his treachery had proved unsuccessful So he took the armed men that were about him and removed from Tiberias to Gischala and wrote to me to apologise for himself concerning what had been done as if it had been done without his approbation and desired me to have THE LIFE OF FLAVIUS JOSEPHUS 205 have no suspicion of him to his disadvantage He also added oaths and certain horrible curses upon himself and supposed he should be thereby believed in the points he wrote about to me 21 But now another great number of the Galileans came to gether again with their weapons as knowing the man how wick ed and how sadly perjured he was and desired me to lead them against him and promised me that they would utterly destroy both him and GIschala Hereupon I professed that I was ob liged to them for their readiness to serve me and that I would more than requite that their goodawill to me However I en treated them to restrain themselves and begged of them to give me leave to do what I intended which was to put an end to these troubles without bloodshed and when I had prevailed with the multitude of the Galileans to let me do so I came to Sepphoris 22 But the inhhitants of this city having determined to con tinue in their allegiance to the Romans were afraid of my co ming to them and tried by putting me upon another action to di vert me that they might be freed from the terror they were in Accordingly they sent to Jesus the captain of those robbers who were in the confines of Ptolemais and promised to give him a great deal of money if he would come with those forces he had with him which were in number eight hundred and fight with us Accordingly he complied with what they desired upon the promises they had made him and was desirous to fall upon us when we were unprepared for him and knew nothing of his co ming beforehand So he sent to me and desired that I would give him leave to come and salute me When 1 had given him that leave which I did without the least knowledge of his treach erous intentions beforehand he took his band of robbers and made haste to come to me Yet did not this his knavery suc ceed well at last for as he was already nearly approaching one of those with him deserted him and came to me and told me what he had undertaken to do When I was informed of this I went into the market place and pretended to know nothing of his treacherous purpose I took with me many Galileans that were armed as also some of those of Tiberias  and when I had given orders that all the roads should be carefully gardeud I charged the keepers of the gates to give admittance to none but Jesus when he came with the principal of his men and to ex clude the rest and in case they aimed to force themselves in to use stripes in order to repel them Accordingly those that had received such a charge did as they were bidden and Jesus came in with a few others  and when I had ordered him to throvy down his arms immediately and told him that if he refused so to do he was a dead man he seeing armed men standing all round  Â 06 THE LIFE OF FLAVIUS JOSEPHUS round about him was terrified and complied  and as for those of his followers that were excluded when they were informed that he was seized they ran away I then called Jesus to me by himself and told him that  I was not a stranger to that treach  erous design he had against me nor was I ignorant by whom  he was sent for  that however I would forgive what he had  done already if he would repent of it and be faithful to me  hereafter And thus upon his promise to do all that I de sired I let him go and gave him leave to get those whom he had formerly had with him together again But I threatened the inhabitants of Sepphoris that if they would not leave off their ungrateful treatment of me I would punish them sufficiently 23 A this time it was that two great men who were under the jurisdiction of the king Agrippa came to me out of the region of Trachonitis bringing their horses and their arms and carrying with them their money also  and when the Jews would force them to be circumcised if they would stay among them I would not permit them to have any force put upon them  but said to them u Every one ought to worship God according to rt his own inclinations and not to be constrained by force  and u that these men who had fled to us for protection ought not  to be so treated as to repent of their coming hither And when I had pacified the multitude I provided for the men that were come to us whatsoever it was they wanted according to their usual way of living and that in great plenty also 24 Now king Agrippa sent an army to make themselves masters of the citadel of Gamala and over it Equiculus Modius but the forces that were sent were not enow to encompass the citadel quite round but lay before it in the open places and be sieged it But when Ebutius the decurion who was intrusted with the government of the great plain heard that I was at Si monias a village situated in the confines of Galilee and was dis tant from him sixty furlongs he took an hundred horsemen that were with him by night and a certain number of footmen a bout two hundred and brought the inhabitants of the city Gi bea along with him as auxiliaries and marched in the night and came to the village where I abode Upon this I pitched my camp over against him which had a great number of forces in it but Ebutius tried to draw us down into the plain as great ly depending on his horsemen t but we would not come down  for  Josephns s opinion is here welllworth noting that every one is to be permit t ed to worship God according to his own conscience and is not to be compelled in matters of religion  as one may here observe on the contrary that the rest of the Jews were still for obliging all those who married Jews to be circumcised and become Jews and were ready to destroy all that would not submit to do so See lest 31 and Luke ix 54 THE I IFE OF FLAVIUS JOSEFHUS Â 07 for when I was satisfied of the advantage that his horse wouM have if we came down into the plain while we were all foot men I resolved to join battle with the enemy where I was Now Ebutius and his party made a courageous opposition for some time  but when he saw that his horse were useless to him in that place he retired back to the city Gibea having lost three of his men in the fight So I followed him directly with twa thousand armed men  and when I was at the city Besara that lay in the confines of Ptolemais but twenty furlongs from Gi bea where Ebutius abode I placed my armed men on the out side of the village and gave orders that they should guard the passes with great care that the enemy should not disturb us un till we should have carried off the corn a great quantity of which lay there  it belonged to Bernice the queen and had been ga thered together out of the neighbouring villages into Besara  so I loaded my camels and asses a great number of which I had brought along with me and sent the corn into Galilee When I had done this I offered Ebutius battle  but when he would not accept of the offer for he was terrified at our readiness and courage I altered my route and marched towards Neopolitanus because I had heard that the country about Tiberias was laid waste by him This Neopolitanus was captain of a troop of horse and had the custody of Scythopolis intrusted to his care by the enemy  and when I had hindered him from doing any farther mischief to Tiberias I set myself to make provision for the affairs of Galilee 27 But when John the son of Levi who as we before told you abode at Gischala was informed how all things had suc ceeded to my mind and that I was much in favour with those that were under me as also that the enemy were greatly afraid of me he was not pleaesd with it as thinking my prosperity tended to his ruin So he took up a bitter envy and enmity against me  and hoping that if he could inflame those that were under me to hate me he should put an end to the prosperi ty I was in he tried to persuade the inhabitants of Tiberias and of Sepphoris and for those of Gabara he supposed they would be also of the same mind with the others which were the great est cities of Galilee to revolt from their subjection to me and to be of his party  and told them that he would command them better than I did As for the people of Sepphoris who belonged to neither of us because they had chosen to be in subjection to the Romans they did not comply with his proposal and for those of Tiberias they did not indeed so far comply as to make a revolt from under me but they agreed to be his friends while the inhabitants of Gabara did go over to John and it was Si maa 208 THE LIFE OF FLAVIUS JOSEFHUS mon that persuaded them so to do one who was both the prin cipal man in the city and a particular friend and companion of John It is true these did not openly own the making a re Tolt because they were in great fear of the Galileans and had frequent experience of the good will they bore to me  yet did they privately watch for a proper opportunity to lay snares for me  and indeed I thereby came into the greatest danger on the occasion following 26 There were some bold young men of the village Da baritta who observed that the wife of Ptolemy the king s pro curator was to make a progress over the great plain with a mighty attendance and with some horsemen that followed as a guard to them and this out of a country that was subject to the king and queen into the jurisdiction of the Romans  and fell upon them on the sudden and obliged the wife of Ptolemy to fly away and plundered all the carriages They also came to me to Taricheae with four mules loading of garments and other furniture  and the weight of the silver they brought was not small and there were five hundred pieces of gold also Now I had a mind to preserve these spoils for Ptolemy who was my countryman  and it is prohibited  us by our laws even to spoil our enemies  so I said to those that brought these spoils that they ought to be kept in order to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem with them when they came to be sold But the young men took it very ill that they did not receive a part of these spoils for themselves as they expected to have none  so they went among the villages in the neighbourhood of Tiberias and told the people that I was going to betray their country to the Romans and that I used deceitful language to them when I said that what had been thus gotten by rapine should be kept for the re building of the walls of the city of Jerusalem  although I had resolved to restore these spoils again to their former owner And indeed they were herein not mistaken as to my intentions  for when I had gotten clear of them I sent for two of the prin cipal men Dassion and Janneus the son of Levi persons that were  How Joseplius could say here that the Jewish laws for bade them to  spoil Â even their enemies while yet a little before his time our Saviour had mention ed it as then a current maxim with them Thou shalt love thy neighbour and hate  thine enemy Matt v 43 is worth our inquiry 1 take it that Josephus hav ing been now for many years an Ebionite Christian had learned this interpreta tion of the law of Moses from Christ whom he owned for the true Messiah as it follows in the succeeding verses which though he might not read in St Mat thew s gofpel yet might he have read much the same exposition in their own Ebionite or Nazarene gospel itself of which improvements made by Josephuj after he was become a Christian we have already had several examples in tliis his life sect 3 M 15 19 21 23 and shall have many more therein before ill conclusion as well as we have them elsewhere in all his latter writings THE LIFE OF FLAVIU3 JOSEPHUS 209 were among the chief friends of the king and commanded them to take the furniture that had been plundered and to send it to him  and I threatened that I would order them to be put to death by way of punishment if they discovered this my com mand to any other person 27 Now when all Galilee was filled with this rumour that their country was about to be betrayed by me to the Romans and when all men were exasperated against me and ready tu bring me to punishment the inhabitants of Taricheae did also themselves suppose that what the young men said was true and persuaded my guards and armed men to leave me when 1 was asleep and to come presently to the hippodrome in order there to take counsel against me their commander And when they had prevailed with them and they were gotten together they found there a great company assembled already who all joined in one clamour to bring the man who was so wicked to them as to betray them to his due punishment and it was Jesus the sou of bappluas who principally set them on He was ruler in 1 i berias a wicked man and naturally disposed to make disturb ances in matters of consequence  a seditious person he was in deed and an innovator beyond every body else He then took the laws of Moses into his hands and came into the midst of the people and said  O my fellow citizens 1 if you are not disposed  to hate Josephus on your own account have regard however  to these laws of your country which your commander in chief  is going to betray  hate him therefore on both these accounts  and bring the man who hath acted thus insolently to his de  served punishment 28 When he had said this and the multitude had openly ap_ plauded him for what he had said he took some of the armed men and made haste away to the house in which 1 lodged as it he would kill me immediately while I was wholly insensible of all till this disturbance happened and by reason of the pains 1 had been taking was fallen fast asleep But Simon who was intrusted with the care of my body and was the only person that stayed with me and saw the violent incursion the citizens made upon me he awaked me and told me of the danger I was in and de sired me to let him kill me that I might die bravely and like a general before my enemies came in and forced me to kill my self or killed me themselves Thus did he discourse to me â but I committed the care of my life to God and made haste to go out to the multitude Accordingly I put on a black gar ment and hung my sword at my neck and went by such a dif ferent way to the hippodrome wherein I thought none of my ad yersaries would meet me j so I appeared among them on the sud Vet III Dd den 210 THE LIFE OF FLAVIUs JOSEPHUS den and fell dovra flat on the earth and bedewed the ground with my tears then I seemed to them all an object of compas sion And when I perceived the change that was made in the mul titude Itried todivide their opinions before the armed men should return from my house so I granted them that I had been as wick sed as they supposed me to be  but still I entreated them to let me first inform them for what use I had kept that money which arose from the plunder and that they might then kill me if they plea sed  and upon the multitude s ordering me to speak the armed men came upon me and when they saw me they rah to kill me but when the multitude bid them hold their hands they com plied and expected that as soon as I should own to them that I kept the money for the king it would be looked on as a confes sion of my treason and they should then be allowed to kill me 29 When therefore silence was made by the whole multi tude I spake thus to them  M O my countrymen  I refuse not  to die if justice so require However I am desirous to tell  you the truth of this matter before I die  for as I know that  this city of yours Taricheae was a city of great hospitality  and filled with abundance of such men as have left their own  countries and are come hither to be partakers of your for  tune whatever it be I had a mind to build walls about it out  of this money for which you are so angry with me while  yet it was to be expended in building your own walls Upon my saying this the people of Taricheae and the strangers cried out That  they gave me thanks and desired me to be of good cou  rage Although the Galileans and the people of Tiberias continued in their wrath against me insomuch that there arose a tumult among them while some threatened to kill me and some bid me not to regard them but when I promised them that I would build them walls at Tiberias and at other cities that wanted them they gave credit to what I promised and re turned every one to his own home So I escaped the foremention ed danger beyond all my hopes and returned to my own house accompanied with my friends and twenty armed men also 30 However these robbers and other authors of this tumult who were afraid on their own account lest I should punish them for what they had done took six hundred armed men and came to the house where I abode in order to set it on fire When this their insult was told me I thought it indecent for me to run away and I resolved to expose myself to danger and to act with some boldness so I gave orders to shut the doors and went up into an upper room anddesired that they would sendsome of their men in to receive the money from the spoils  for I told them hey would then have no occasion to be angry with me and when THE LIFE OF FLAVIUS JOSEPHUS 211  they had sent in one of the boldest of them all I had him whip ped severely and I commanded that one of his hands should be cut off and hung about his neck  and in this case was he put out to those that sent him At which procedure of mine they were greatly affrighted and in no small consternation and were afraid that they should themselves be served in like manner if they stayed there  for they supposed that I had in the house more armed men than they had themselves so they ran away immediately while I by the use of this stratagem escaped this their second treacherous design against me 31 But there were still some that irritated the multitude against me and said that those great men that belonged to the king ought not to be suffered to live if they would not change their religion to the religion of those to whom they fled for safe ty  they spake reproachfully of them also and said that they were wizards and such as called in the Romans upon them So the multitude was soon deluded by such plausible pretences as were agreeable to their own inclinations and were prevailed on by them But when I was informed of this I instructed ths multitude again that those that fled to them for refuge ought not to be persecuted  I also laughed at the allegation about witchcraft  and told them that the Romans would not maintain so many ten thousand soldiers if they could overcome their ene mies by wizards Upon my saying this the people assented for a while  but they returned afterward as irritated by some ill people against the great men  nay they once made an assault upon the house in which they dwelt at Taricheae in order to kill them  which when I was informed of I was afraid lest so hor rid a crime should take effect and no body else would make that city their refuge any more I therefore came myself and some others with me to the house where these great men lived and locked their doors and had a trench drawn from their house leading to the lake and sent for a ship and embarked therein with them and sailed to the confines of Hippos  I also paid them the value of their horses nor in such a flight could I have their horses brought to them I then dismissed them and begged of them earnestly that they would courageously bear this distress which befel them I was also myself greatly displeased that I was compelled to expose those that had fled to me to go again in to an enemy s country  yet did I think it more eligible that they should perish among the Romans if it should so happen than in the country that was under my jurisdiction However they es D d 2 caped  Here we may observe the vulgar Jewish notions of witchcraft but that our Joscphus was too wise to give any countenance to 212 THE LIFE OF FLAVIUS JOSEPHUS caped at length and king Agrippa forgave them their offences And this was the conclusion of what concerned th ese men 32 But as for the inhabitants of the city of Tiberias they wrote to the king and desired him to send them forces sufficient to be guard to their country  for that they were desirous to come over to him this was what they wrote to him But when I came to them they desired me to build their walls as I had promised them to do for they had heard that the walls of Tarichea e were already built I agreed to the proposal accordingly  and when I had made preparation for the entire building I gave order to the architects to go to work  but on the third day when I was gone to Taricheae which was thirty furlongs distant from Tibe rias it so fell out that some Roman horsemen were discovered on tbeir march not far from the city which made it to be supposed that the forces were come from the king upon which they shout ed and lifted up their voices in commendations of the king and in reproaches against me Hereupon one came running to me and told me what their dispositions were and that they had re solved to revolt from me  upon hearing which news I was very much alarmed for I had already sent away my armed men from Taricheae to their own homes because the next day was our Sabbath  for I would not have the people of Taricheae dis turbed on that day by a multitude of soldiers and indeed whenever I sojourned at that city I never took any particular care for a guard about my own body because I had had frequent instances of the fidelity its inhabitants bore to me I had now about me no more than seven armed men besides some friends and was doubtful what to do  for to send to recall my own for ces I did not think proper because the present day was almost over  and had those forces been with me I could not take up arms on the next day because our laws forbade us so to do even though our necessity should be Tery great and if I should per mit the people of Taricheae and the strangers with them to guard the city I saw that they would not be sufficient for that purpose and I perceived that I should be obliged to delay my assistance a great while  for I thought with myself that the forces that came from the king would prevent me and that I should be driven out of the city I considered therefore how to get clear of these forces by a stratagem  so I immediately placed those my friends of Taricheae on whom I could best confide at the gates to watch those very carefully who went out at those gates  I also called to me the heads of families and bid every one of them to seize upon a ship  to go on board it and to take a master with them and  In this section as well as sect 18 and sect 33 those small vessels that saii ed on the sea of Galilee are called by JosephuJ Nw and na Â Â and mafn i e THE LIFE OF FLAVIUS JOSEPHUSi 213 and follow him to the city of Tiberias I also myself went on board one of those ships with my friends and the seven arme  men already mentioned and sailed for Tiberias 33 But now when the people of Tiberias perceived that there were no forces come from the king and yet saw the whole lake full of ships they were in fear what would become of their city and were greatly terrified as supposing that the ships were full of men on board  so then they changed their minds and threw down their weapons and met me with their wives and children and made acclamations to me with great commendations  tor they imagined that I did not know their former inclinations to have been against me  so they persuaded me to spare the city But when I was come near enough I gave order to the masters of the ships to cast anchor a good way off the land that the peo ple of Tiberias might not perceive that the ships had no men on board  but I went nearer to the people in one of the ships and rebuked them for their folly and that they were so fickle as without any just occasion in the world to revolt from their fide lity to me However I assured them that I would entirely forgive them for the time to come if they would send ten of the ringleaders of the multitude to me  and when they com plied readily with this proposal and sent me the men foremen tioned I put them on board a ship and sent them away to Ta richeae and ordered them to be kept in prison 34 And by this stratagem it was that I gradually got all the senate of Tiberias into my power and sent them to the city forementioned with many of the principal men among the po pulous and those not fewer in number than the other But when the multitude saw into what great miseries they had brought themselves they desired me to punish the author of this sedition  his name was Clitus a young man bold and rash in his undertakings Now since I thought it not agreeable to piety to put one of my own people to death and yet found ic necessary to punish him I ordered Levi one of my own guards to go to him and cut off one of ClitUs s hands  but as he that was ordered to do this was afraid to go out of the ship alone among so great a multitude I was not willing that the timo rousness of the soldier should appear to the people of Tiberias So I called to Clitus himself and said to him  Since thou de Â sefvest to lose both thine hands for thy ingratitude to me be  thou thine own executioner lest if thou refusest so to be  thou undergo a worse punishment And when he earnestly begged plainly ships so that we need not wonder at our Evangelists who still call them shipi nor ought we to render them boats ai some do Their number was ia all 130 as we learn from our author elsewhere Of the War B II ch xxi sect 8 214 THE LIFE OF FLAVIUS JOSEPHUS begged of me to spare him one of his hands it was with difficult ty that I granted it So in order to prevent the loss of both his hands he willingly took his sword and cut off his own left hand  and this put an end to the sedition 35 Now the men of Tiberias after I was gone to Taricheae perceived what stratagem I had used against them and they ad mired how I had put an end to their foolish sedition without shedding of blood  But now when I had sent for some of those multitudes of the people of Tiberias out of prison among whom were Justus and his father Pistus I made them to sup with me  and during our supper time I said to them that I knew the power of the Romans was superior to all others but did not say so publicly because of the robbers So I advised them to do as I did and to wait for a proper opportunity and not to be uneasy at my being their commander  for that they could not expect to have another who would use the like moderation that I had done I also put Justus in mind how the Galileans had cut off his brother s hands before ever I came to Jerusalem upon on accusation laid against him as if he had been a rogue and had forged some letters  as also how the people of Gamala in a sedition they raised against the Babylonians after the de parture of Philip slew Chares who was a kinsman of Philip and withal how they had wisely punished Jesus his brother Jus tus s sister s husband with death When I had said this to them during supper time I in the morning ordered Justus and all the rest that were in prison to be loosed out of it and sent away  36 But before this it happened that Philip the son of Jaci mus went out of the citadel of Gamala upon the following oc casion  When Philip had been informed that Varus was put out of his government by king Agrippa and that Modius Equieo lus a man that was of old his friend and companion was come to succeed him he wrote to him and related what turns of for tune he had had and desired him to forward the letters he sent to the king and queen Now when Modius had received these letters he was exceedingly glad and sent the letters to the king and queen who were then about Berytus But when king A grippa knew that the story about Philip was false for it had been given out that the Jews had begun a war with the Ro mans and that this Philip had been their commander in that wax he sent some horsemen to conduct Philip to him and when he was come he saluted him very obligingly and shewed him to the Roman commanders and told them that this was the man of whom the report had gone about as if he had revolted from the Romans He also bid him to take some horsemen with him and to go quickly to the citadel of Gamala and to bring out THE LIFE OF FLAVIUS JOSEPIIUS 215 r out tlieiice all his domestics and to restore the Babylonians to Batanea again He also gave it him in charge to take all possi ble cape that none of his subjects should be guilty of making any innovation Accordingly upon these directions from the king he made haste to do what he was commanded 37 Now there was one Joseph the son of a female physician who excited a great many young men to join with him He al so insolently addressed himself to the principal persons at Gamala and persuaded them to revolt from the king and take up arms and gave them hopes that they should by his means recover their liberty And some they forced into the service  and those that would not acquiesce in what they had resolved on they slew They also slew Chares and with him Jesus one of his kinsmen and a brother of Justus of Tiberias as we have already said Those of Gamala also wrote to me desiring me to send them an armed force and workmen to raise up the walls of their city  nor did I reject either of their requests The region of Gaulonitis did also revolt from the king as far as the village So lyma I also built a wall about Seleucia and Soganni which are villages naturally of very great strength Moreover I in like manner walled several villages of Upper Galilee though they were very rocky of themselves Their names are Jamnia and Meroth and Achabaru I also fortified in the Lower Ga lilee the cities Taricheae Tiberias Sepphoris and the villages the Cave of Arbela Bersobe Selamin Jotapata Caphareccho and Siggo and Japha and Mount Tabor  I also laid up a great quantity of corn in these places and arms withal that might be for their security afterward 38 But the hatred that John the son of Levi bore to me grew now more violent while he could not bear my prosperity with patience So he proposed to himself by all means possible to make away with me and built the walls of Gischala which was the place of his nativity He then sent his brother Simon and Jonathan the son of Sisenna and about an hundred armed men to Jerusalem to Simon the son of Gamaliel f in order to persuade him to induce the commonalty of Jerusalem to take from me  the government over the Galileans and to give their suffrages for conferring that authority upon him This Simon was of the city Jerusalem and of a very noble family of the sect of the Pharisees  Part of these fortifications on Mount Tabor may be those still remaining and which were Seen lately by Mr Maundrel See his Travels p i iz t This Gamaliel may be the very same that is mentioned by the rabbins in the Mishna in Juchasin and in Porto Mosis as is observed in the Latin notes He might be also that Gamaliel 11 whose grandfather was Gamaliel I who is men tioned Acts v 34 and at whose feet St I aul wai brought up Acts xxii 3 See d at the year 445 6 THE LrÂ E OF FLAVIUS JOSEPHUS Pharisees which are supposed to excel others in the accurate knowledge of the laws of their country He was a man of great wisdom and reason and capable of restoring public affairs by his prudence when they were in an ill posture He was also an old friend and companion of John  but at that time he had a differ ence with me When therefore he had received such an exhor tation he persuaded the high priests Ananus and Jesus the son of Gamala and some others of the same seditious faction to cut me down now I was growing so great and not to overlook me while I was aggrandizing myself to the height of glory  and he said that it would be for the advantage of the Galileans if I were deprived of my government there Ananus also and his friends desired them to make no delay about the matter lest I should get the knowledge of what was doing too soon and should come and make an assault upon the city with a great army This was the counsel of Simon but Ananus the high priest demonstra ted to them that this was not an easy thing to be done because many of the high priests and of the rulers of the people bore wit ness that I had acted like an excellent general and that it was the work of ill men to accuse one against whom they had nothing to say 39 When Simon heard Ananus say this he desired that the messengers would conceal the thing and not let it come among many  for that he would take care to have Josephus removed out of Galilee very quickly So he called for John s brother Simon and charged him that they should send presents to A nanus and his friends  for as he said they might probably by that means persuade them to change their minds And indeed Simon did at length thus compass what he aimed at for Ananus and those with him being corrupted by bribes agreed to expel me out of Galilee without making the rest of the citizins ac quainted with what they were doing Accordingly they resol ved to send men of distinction as to their families and of distinc tion as to their learning also Two of these were of the popu lace Jonathan  and Ananias by s ct of Pharisees  while the third Jozar was of the stock of the priests and a Pharisee also  and Simon the last of them was of the youngest of the high priests These had it given them in charge that when they were come to the multitude of the Galileans they should ask them what was the reason of their love to me  and if they said that it was because I was born at Jerusalem that they should reply that they four were all born at the same place  and if they should say it was because I was well versed in their law they should reply that neither were they unacquainted with the Â This Jonathan is also taken notice of in the Latin notes as the same that is mentioned by the rabbins in Porta Mosis THE LIFE OF FLAVIUS JOSEPH S 211 the practices of their country  but if besides these they should say they loved me because I was a priest they should reply that two of these were priests also 40 Now when they had given Jonathan and his companions these instructions they gave them forty thousand drachmae out of the public money  but when they heard that there was a certain Galilean that then sojourned at Jerusalem whose name was Jesus who had about him a band of six hundred armed men they sent for him and gave him three month s pay and gave him orders to follow Jonathan and his companions and be obe dient to them They also gave money to three hundred men that were citizens of Jerusalem to maintain them all and order ed them also to follow the ambassadors  and when they had complied and were gotten ready for the march Jonathan and his companions went out with them having along with them John s brother and an hundred armed men The charge that was given them by those that Sent them was this that if I would voluntarily lay down my arms they should send me alive to the city Jerusalem but that in case I opposed them they should kill me and fear nothing  for that it was their command for them so to do They also wrote to John to make all ready for fight ing me and gave order to the inhabitants of Sepphoris and Ga bara and Tiberias to send auxiliaries to John 41 Now as my father wrote me an account of this for Jesus the son of Gamala who was present in that council a friend and companion of mine told him of it I was very much troubled as discovering thereby that my fellow citizens pro ved so ungrateful to me as out of envy to give order that I should be slain  my father earnestly pressed me also in his letter to come to him for that he longed to see his son before he died I informed my friends of these things and that in three days time I should leave the country and go home Upon hearing this they were all very sorry and desired me with tears in their eyes not to leave them to be destroyed for so they thought they should be if I were deprived of the command over them  but as I did not grant their request but was taking care of my own safety the Galileans out of their dread of the consequence of my departure that they should then be at the mercy of the robbers sent messengers over all Galilee to inform them of my resolution to leave them Whereupon as soon as they heard it they got together in great numbers from ail parts with their wives and children  and this they did as it appeared to me not more out of their affection to me than out of their fear on their own account for while I staid with them they supposed that they should suffer no harm So they all came into the great plain wherein I lived the name of which was AsoMs VOL III E e 42 But 218 THE LIFE OF FLAVIUS JOSEFHU9 42 But wonderful it was what a dream I saw that very night for when I had betaken myself to my bed as grieved and disturbed at the news that had been written to me it seemed to me that a certain person stood by me and said  O Josephus   leave off to afflict thy soul and put away all fear  for what  now grieves thee will render thee very considerable and in  all respects most happy  for thou shalt get over not only these  difficulties but many others with great success However  be not cast down but remember that thou art to fight with  the Romans When I had seen this dream I got up with an intention of going down to the plain Now when the whole multitude of the Galileans among whom were the women and children saw me they threw themselves down upon their faces and with tears in their eyes besought me not to leave them exposed to their enemies nor to go away and permit their country to be injured by them But when I did not comply with their entreaties they compelled me to take an oath that I would stay with them  they also cast abundance of reproaches upon the people of Jerusalem that they would net let tlieir country enjoy peace 43 When I heard this and saw what sorrow the people were in I was moved with compassion to them and thought it be came me to undergo the most manifest hazards for the sake of so great a multitude  so I let them know I would stay with them And when I had given order that five thousand of them should come to me armed and with provisions for their main tenance I sent the rest away to their own homes  and when those five thousand were come I took them together with three thousand of the soldiers that were with me before and eighty horsemen and marched to the village of Chabolo situated in the confines of Ftolemais and there kept my forces together pre tending to get ready to fight with Placidus who was come with two cohorts of footmen and one troop of horsemen and was sent thither by Cestius Gallus to burn those villages of Galilee that were near Ptolemais Upon whose casting up a bank before the city Ptolemais I also pitched my camp at about the distance of sixty furlongs from that village And now we frequently brought out our forces as if we would fight but proceeded no farther than skirmishes at a distance  for when Placidus per ceived that I was earnest to come to battle he was afraid and avoided it Yet did he not remove from the neighbourhood of Ptolemais  44 About  This I take to be the Erst of Josephus s remarkable or divine dreams which were predictive of the great things that afterward came to pass of which see more in the note on Antiq B III chap viii sect 5 The other is in the War B III ch viii sect 3 5 THE LIFE OF FLAVIUS JOSEPflUS 219 44 About this time it was that Jonathan and his fellow legates came They were sent as we have said already by Simon and Ananus the high priest And Jonathan contrived how he might catch me by treachery  for he durst not make any attempt upon me openly So he wrote me the following epistle   Jonathan and those that are with him and are sent  by the people of Jerusalem to Josephus send greeting We  are sent by the principal men of Jerusalem who have heard  that John of Gischala hath laid many snares for thee to re  buke him and to exhort him to be subject to thee hereafter u We are also desirous to consult with thee about our common  concerns and what is fit to be done We therefore desire  thee to come to us quickly and to bring only a few men  with thee  for this village will not contain a great number of  soldiers Thus it was that they wrote as expecting one of these two things either that I should come without armed men and then they should have me under their power or if I came with a great number they should judge me to be a pub Hc enemy Now it was an horseman who brought the letter a man at other times bold and one that had served in the army under the king It was the second hour of the night that he came when I was feasting with my friends and the principal of the Galileans This man upon my servant s telling me that a certain horseman of the Jewish nation was come was called in at my command but did not so much as salute me at all but held out a letter and said  This letter is sent  thee by those that are come from Jerusalem  do thou write  an answer to it quickly for I am obliged to return to them  very soon Now my guests could not but wonder at the boldness of the soldier Uut 1 desired him to sit down and sup with us  but when he refused so to do I held the letter in my hands as I received it and fell talking with my guests about other matters But a few hours afterwards I got up and when I had dismissed the rest to go to their beds I bid only four of my intimate friends to stay and ordered my servant to get some wine ready I also opened the letter so that nobody could perceive it  and understanding thereby presently the pur port of the writing I sealed it up again and appeared as if I had not yet read it but only held it in my hands I ordered  twenty drachma should be given the soldier for the charges of his journey  and when he took the money and said he thank ed me for it I perceived that he loved money and that he was to be caught chiefly by that means and I said to him  If thou  wilt but drink with us thou shall have a drachma for every  glass thou drinkest So he gladly embraced the proposal E e 2  and 220 THE LIFE OF FLAV1US JOSEFHUS and drank a great deal of wine in order to get the more money and was so drunk that at last he could not keep the secrets he was intrusted with but discovered them without my putting questions to him viz that a treacherous design was contrived against me and that I was doomed to die by those that sent him When I heard this I wrote back this answer   Josephus to  Jonathan and those that are with him sendeth greeting Upon  the information that you are come in health into Galilt e 1 re  joice and tKis especially because I can now resign the care of  public affairs here into your hands and return into my na  live country  which is what I have desired to do a great  while  and I confess I ought not only to come to you as far  as Xaloth but farther and this without your commands  But I desire you to excuse me because I cannot do it now  since I watch the motions of Placidus who hath a mind to go  up into Galilee  and this I do here at Chabolo Do you Â therefore on the receipt of this epistle come hither to me  Fare you well 45 When I had written thus and given the letter to be car ried by the soldier sent along with them thirty of the Galileans of the best characters and gave the ji instructions to salute those ambassadors but to say nothing else to them I also gave orders to as many of those armed men whom I esteemed most faith ful to me to go along with the others every one with him whom he was to guard lest some conversation might pass be tween those whom I sent and those who were with Jonathan So those men went to Jonathan But when Jonathan and his partners had failed in this their first attempt they sent me another letter the contents whereof were as follows   Jona  than and those with him to Josephus send greeting We re  quire thee to come to us to the village Gabaroth on the third  day without any armed men that we may hear what thou Â hast to lay to the charge of John of Gischala When they had written this letter they saluted the Galileans whom I sent and came to Japha which was the largest village of all Galilee and encompassed with very strong walls and had a great number of inhabitants in it There the multitude of men with their wives and children met them and exclaimed loudly against them and desired them to be gone and nor to envy them the advantage of an excellent commander With these clamours Jonathan and his partners were greatly provoked al though they durst not shew their anger openly  so they made him no answer but went to other villages But still the same cla mours met them from all the people who said  Nobody should  persuade them to have any other commander besides Jose  phus So Jonathan and his partners went away from them  THE LIFE OF FLAVIUS JOSEPHUS 221 without success and came to Sepphoris the greatest city of all Galilee Now the men of that city who inclined to the Romans in their sentiments met them indeed but neither praised nor re proached me  and when they were gone clown from Sepphoris to Asochis the people of that place made a clamour against them as those of Japha had done Whereupon they were able to con tain themselves no longer but ordered the armed men that were with them to beat those that made the clamour with their clubs And when they came to Gabara John met them with three thousand armed men  but as I understood by their letter that they had resolved to fight against me I arose from Chabolo with three thousand armed men also  but left in my camp one of my fastest friends and came to Jotapata as desirous to be near them the distance being no more than forty furlongs Whence I wrote thus to them   If you are very desirous that I should come to  you you know there are two hundred and forty cities and vil  lages in Galilee I will come to any of them which you please  excepting Gabara and Gischala  the one of which is John s  native city and the other in confederacy and friendship with  him 46 When Jonathan and his partners had received this letter they wrote to me no more answers but called a council of their friends together and taking John into their consultation they took counsel together by what means they might attack me John s opinion was that they should write to all the cities and villages that were in Galilee  for that there must be certainly one or two persons in every one of them that were at variance with me and that they be invited to come to oppose me as an enemy He would also have them send this resolution of theirs to the city Jerusalem that its citizens upon the knowledge of my being adjudged to be an enemy by the Galileans might them selves also confirm that determination He said also that when this was done even those Galileans who were affected to me would desert me out of fear When John had given them this counsel what he had said was very agreeable to the rest of them I was also made acquainted with these affairs about the third hour of the night by the means of one Saccheus who had belonged to them but now deserted them and came over to me and told me what they were about so I perceived that no time was to be lost Accordingly I gave command to Jacob an armed man of my guard whom I esteemed faithful to me to take two hundred men and to guard the passages that led from Gabara to Galilee and to seize upon the passengers and send them to me especially such as were caught with letters about them I also sent Jeremias himself one of my friends with six hundred arrced men 222 THE LIFE OF FLAVIUS JOSEFHtTS men to the borders of Galilee in order to watch the roads that led from the country to the city Jerusalem and gave him charge to lay hold of such as travelled with letters about them to keep the men in bonds upon the place but to send me the letters 47 When I had laid these commands upon them I gave them orders and bid them to take their arms and bring three days provision with them and be with me the next day I also part ed those that were about me into four parts and ordained those of them that were most faithful to me to be a guard to my bo dy I also set over them centurions and commanded them to take care that not a soldier which they did not know should mingle himself among them Now on the fifth day following when I was at Gabaroth I found the entire plain that was before the village full of armed men who wer e come out of Galilee to assist me  many others of the multitude also out of the village ran along with me But as soon as I had taken my place and began to speak to them they all made an acclamation and call ed me the benefactor and saviour of the country And when I had made them my acknowledgements and thanked them for their affection to me I also advised them to fight  with no body nor to spoil the country  but to pitch their tents in the plain and be content with their sustenance they had brought with them  for I told them I had a mind to compose these troubles without shedding any blood Nowit came to pass that on thevery same day those who were sent by John with letters fell among the guards whom I appointed to watch the roads  so the men were themselves kept upon the place as my orders were but I got the letters which were full of reproaches and lies  and 1 in tended to fall upon these men without saying a word of these matters to any body 48 Now as soon as Jonathan and his companions heard of my coming they took all their own friends and John with them and retired to the house of Jesus which indeed was a large castle and no way unlike a citadel so they privately laid a band of armed men therein and shut all the other doors but one which they kept open and they expected that I should come out of the road to them to salute them And indeed they had given or ders to the armed men that when I came they should let no body besides rue come in but should exclude others 5 as sup posing that by this means they should easily get me under their power  but they were deceived in their expectation  for I per ceived Â Josephus s directions to his soldiers here are much the same that John the Baptist gave Luke iii 14  Do Violence to no man neither accuse any falsely  and be content with your wages Whence Dr Hudson confirms this conjec ture that Josephus in some things was even now a follower of John the Bap tist which is no way improbable See the note on sect z THE LITE OF FLAVIUI JOSEPHU3 223 ceived what snares they had laid for me No v as soon as I was got off my journey I took up my lodgings over against them and pretended to be asleep  so Jonathan and his party thinking that I was really asleep and at rest made haste to go down into the plain to persuade the people that I was an ill governor But the matter proved otherwise  for upon their appearance there was a cry made by the Galileans immediately declaring their good opinion of me as their governor  and they made a clamour against Jonathan and his partners for coming to them when they had suffered no harm and as though they would overturn their happy settlement and desired them by all means to go back a gain for that they would never be persuaded to have any other to rule over them but myself When I heard of this I did riot fear to go down into the midst of them  I went therefore my self down presently to hear what Jonathan and his companions said As soon as I appeared there was immediately an accla mation made to me by the whole multitude and a cry in my commendation by them who confessed their thanks was owing to me for my good government of them 49 When Jonathan and his companions heard this they were in fear of their own lives and in danger lest they should be as saulted by the Galileans on my account  so they contrived how they might run away But as they were not able to get off for I desired them to stay they looked down with concern at my words to them I ordered therefore the multitude to restrain en tirely their acclamations and placed the most faithful of my arm ed men upon the avenues to be a guard to us lest John should unexpectedly fall upon us  and I encouraged the Galileans to take their weapons lest they should be disturbed at their ene mies if any sudden insult should be made upon them And then in the first place I put Jonathan and his partners in mind of their former letter and after what manner they had written to me and declared they were sent by the common consent of the people of Jerusalem to make up the differences I had with John and how they had desired me to come to them  and as I spake thus I publicly shewed that letter they had written till they could not at all deny what they had done the letter itself convicting them I then said  O Jonathan  and you that are  sent with him as his colleagues if I were to be judged as to  my behaviour compared with that of John s and had brought  no more than two  or three witnesses good men and true it  is  We here learn the practice of the Jews in the days of Josenhus to inquire into the characters of witneses before they were admitted and that their num ber ought to be three or two at the least also exactly as in the law of Moses and in the Apostolical Constitutions B II ch 37 See Horeb Covenant Revived paje 9 j 98 224 THE LIFE OF FLAVlUS JOSEPHUS   is plain yon had been forced upon the examination of their  characters beforehand to discharge the accusations that  therefore you may be informed that I have acted well in  the affairs of Galilee I think three witnesses too few to be  brought by a man that hath done as he ought to do  so I gave  you all these for witnesses Inquire of them  how I have Â lived and whether I have not behaved myself with all decen  cy and after a virtuous manner among them And I farther  conjure you O Galileans  to hide no part of the truth but to  speak before these men as before judges whether I have in  any thing acted otherwise than well 50 While I was thus speaking the united voices of all the people joined together and called me their benefactor and sa viour and attested to my former behaviour and exhorted me to continue so to do hereafter  and they all said  upon their oaths that their wives had been preserved free from injuries and that no one had ever been aggrieved by me After this I read to the Galileans two of those epistles which had been sent by Jona than and his colleagues and which those whom I had appointed to guard the road had taken and sent to me These were full of reproaches and of lies as if I had acted more like a tyrant than a governor against them with many other things besides therein contained which were no better indeed than impudent falsities I also informed the multitude how I came by these letters and that those who carried them delivered them up voluntarily  for I was not willing that my enemies should know any thing of the guards I had set lest they should be afraid and leave off writing hereafter 5J When the multitude heard these things they were great ly provoked at Jonathan and his colleagues that were with him and were going to attack them and kill them  and this they had certainly done unless I had restrained the anger of the Galileans and said That  I forgave Jonathan and his colleagues what was  past if they would repent and go to their own country and  tell those who sent them the truth as to my conduct When I had said this 1 let them go although I knew they would do no thing of what they had promised But the multitude were very much enraged against them and entreated me to give them leave to punish them for their insolence  yet did I try all methods to persuade them to spare the men  for I knew that every instance of sedition was pernicious to the public welfare But the mul titude Â This appeal to the whole body of the Galileans by Josephns and the testi mony they gave him of integrity in his conduct e as their governor is very like that appeal and tetsimony in the case of the prophet Samuel i Sam xii Iâ 5 and perhaps Mas done by Josephus in imitation of him THE LIFE OF FLAVIUS JOSEPHUS 225 titude was too angry with them to be dissuaded and all of them went immediately to the house in which Jonathan and his col leagues abode However when I perceived that their rage could not be restrained I got on horseback and ordered the mul titude to follow me to the village Sogane which was twenty fur longs off Gabara  and by using this stratagem I so managed my self as not to appear to begin a civil war amongst them 52 But when 1 was come near Sogane I caused the multitude to make an halt and exhorted them not to be so easily provoked to anger and to the inflicting such punishments as could not be afterwards recalled  I also gave order that an hundred men who were already in years and were principal men among theui should get themselves ready to go to the city Jerusalem and should make a complaint before the people of such as raised se ditions in the country And I said to them that  in case they  be moved with what you say you shall desire the community Â to write to me and to enjoin me to continue in Galilee and to  order Jonathan and his colleagues to depart out of it When I had suggested these instructions to them and while they were getting themselves ready as fast as they could I sent them on this errand the third day after they had been assembled  I also sent five hundred armed men with them as a guard I then wrote to my friends in Samaria to take care that they might safely pass through the country  for Samaria was already under the Romans and it was absolutely necessary for those that go quickly to Jerusalem to pass through that country  for in that road you may in three days time go from Galilee to Jerusa lem I also went myself and conducted the old men as far as the bounds of Galilee and set guards in the roads that it might not be easily known by any one that these men were gone And when I had thus done I went and abode at Japha 53 Now Jonathan and his colleagues having failed of accom plishing what they would have done against me they sent John back to Gischala but went themselves to the city Tiberias expect ing it would submit itself to them  and this was founded on a letter which Jesus their then governor had written them promising that if they came the multitude would receive them and choose to be under their government  so they went their ways with this expectation But Silas who as I said had been left curator of Tiberias by me informed me of this and desired me to make haste thither Accordingly I complied with his advice imme diately and came thither  but found myself in danger of my life from the following occasion  Jonathan and his colleagues had been at Tiberias and had persuaded a great many of such as had a quarrel with me to desert me  but when they heard of my VOL III F f coming 220 THE LIFE OF FLAVIUS JOSEPHUS coming they were in fear for themselves and came to me an when they had saluted me they said that I was an happy man in having behaved myself so well in the government of Ga lilee  and they congratulated me upon the honours that were paid me  for they said that my glory was a credit to them since they had been my teachers and fellow citizens and they said farther that it was but just that they should prefer my friendship to them rather than John s and that they would have immediately gone home but that they staid that they might de liver up John into my power  and when they said this they rook their oaths of it and those such as are most tremendous amongst u s and such as I did not think fit to disbelieve How ever they desired me to lodge some where else  because the next day was the Sabbath and that it was not fit the city of Ti berias should be disturbed on that day 54 So I suspected nothing and went away to Taricheae  yet did 1 withal leave some to make inquiry in the city how matters went and whether any thing was said about me I also set many persons all the way that led from Taricheae to Tiberias that they might communicate from one to another if they learned any news from those that were left in the city On the next day therefore they all came into the Proseucha   it was a large edifice and capable of receiving a great number of people  thither Jonathan went in and though he durst not openly speak of a revolt yet did he say that their city stood in heed of a better governor than it then had But Jesus who was the ruler made no scruple to speak out and said openly  O fellow citizens  it is â better for you to be in subjection to four than to one  and  those such as are of high birth and not without reputation for  their wisdom  and pointed to Jonathan and his colleagues Upon his saying this Justus came in and condemned him for what he had said and persuaded some of the people to be of his mind also But the multitude were not pleased with what was said and had certainly gone into a tumult unless the sixth hour which was now come had dissolved the assembly at which hour our laws require us to go to dinner on Sabbath days  so Jona than and his colleagues put off their council till the next day and went off without success When I was informed of these af fairs I determined to go to the city of Tiberias in the morning Accordingly on the next day about the first hour of the day 1 THE LIFE Of FLAVIUS JOSEPHUS 227 fatne to Taricheae and found the multitude ready assembled in Proseucha  but on what account they were gotten together those that were assembled did not know But when Jonathan and his colleagues saw them there unexpectedly they were in dis order  after which they raised a report of their own contrivance that Roman horsemen were seen at a place called Union in the borders of Galilee thirty furlongs distant from the city Upon which report Jonathan and his colleagues cunningly exhorted me not to neglect this matter nor to suffer the land to be spoiled by the enemy And this they said with a design to remove me out of the city under the pretence of the want of extraordinary assistance while they might dispose the city to my enemy 55 As for myself although I knew of their design yet did I comply with what they proposed lest the people of Tiberias should have occasion to suppose that I was not careful of their Security I therefore went out but when I was at the place I found not the least footsteps of any enemy so I returned as fast as ever I could and found the whole council assembled and the body of the people gotten together and Jonathan and his col leagues bringing vehement accusations against me as one that had no concern to ease them of the burdens of war and as one that lived luxuriously And as they were discoursing thus they produ ced four letters as written to them from some people that lived at the borders of Galilee imploring that they would come to their assistance for that there was an army of Romans both frorse men and footmen who would come and lay waste the coun try on the third day  they desired them also to make haste and not to overlook them When the people of Tiberias heard this they thought they spake truth and made a clamour against me and said 1 ought not to sit still but to go away to the assistance of their countrymen  Hereupon I said for I understood the meaning of Jonathan and his colleagues that I was ready to com ply with what they proposed and without delay to march to the war which they spake of yet did I advise them at the same time that since these letters declared that the Romans would make their assault in four several places they should part their forces into five bodies and make Jonathan and his colleagues generals of each body of them because it was fit for brave men not only to give counsel but to take the place of leaders and assist their countrymen when such a necessity pressed them  for said I it is not possible for me to lead more than one party This advice of mine greatly pleased the multitude  so they compelled them to go forth to war But their designs were put into very much disorder beca ase they IICK not done what they designed to do F f 2  on 228 THE LIFE OF FLAVIUS JOSEPHUS on account of ray stratagem which was opposite to their under takings 56 Now there was one whose name was Ananias a wicked man he was and very mischievous  he proposed that a general religious fast  should be appointed the next day fpr all the peo ple and gave order that at the same hour they should come to the same place without any weapons to make it manifest before God thatwhile they obtained his assistance they thought all these weapons useless This he said not out of piety but that they might catch me and my friends unarmed Now I was  reupon forced to comply lest I should appear to despise a pro posal that tended to piety As soon therefore as we were gone home Jonathan and his colleagues wrote to John to come to them in the morning and desiring him to come with as many soldiers as he possibly could for that they should then be able easily to get me into their hands and to do all that they desired to do When John had received this letter he resolved to com ply with it As for myself on the next day I ordered two of the guards of my body whom I esteemed the most courageous and most faithful to hide daggers under their garments and to go along with me that we might defend ourselves if any attack should be made upon us by our enemies I also myself took my breast plate and girt on my sword so that it might be as far as was possible concealed and came into the Proseucha 57 Now Jesus who was the ruler commanded that they should exclude all that came with me for he kept the door him self and suffered none but his friends to go in And while we were engaged in the duties of the day and had betaken ourselves to our prayers Jesus got up and inquired of me what was become of the vessels that were taken out of the king s palace when it was burnt down and of that uncoined silver  and in whose possession they now were  This he said in order to drive nway time till John should come I said that Capellus and the ten principal men of Tiberias had them all and I told him that they might ask them whether I told a lie or not And when they said they had them he asked me what is become of those twenty pieces of gold which thou didst receive upon the sale of a certain weight of uncoined money  I replied that I had given them to those ambassadors of theirs as a maintenance for them when they were sent by them to Jerusalem So Jonathan and his colleagues said that I had not done well to pay the ambassa dors out of the public money And when the multitude were very  One mavo nserve here that this lay Pharisee Ananias as we have seen he xvas sect 3 p took upon him to appoint a fast at Tiberias and was obeyed tho igh iniked ii was not cut of religion but knavish polic THE LIFE OF FLAVItIS JOSEPJIUS 229 Very angry at them for this for they perceived the wickedness of the men I understood that a tumult was going to arise  and being desirous to provoke the public to a greater rage against the men I said  But if I have not done well in paying our ambas  sadors out of the public stock leave off your anger at rr e for  I will repaythe twenty pieces of gold myself 58 When I had said this Jonathan and his colleagues held their peace  but the people were still more irritated against them upon their openly shewing their unjust ill will to me When Jesus saw this change in the people he ordered them to depart but desired the senate to stay  for that they could not examine things of such a nature in tumult and as the people were cry ing out that they would not leave me alone there came one and told Jesus and his friends privately that John and his armed men were at hand  whereupon Jonathan and his colleagues being able to contain themselves no longer and perhaps the pro vidence of God hereby procuring my deliverance for had not this been so I had certainly been destroyed by John said  O  you people of Tiberias  leave off this inquiry about the twenty  pieces of gold  for Josephus hath not deserved to die for them   but he hath deserved it by his desire of tyrannizing and by  cheating the multitude of the Galileans with his speeches in  order to gain the dominion over them When he had said this they presently laid hands upon me and endeavoured to kill me  but as soon as those that were with me saw what they did they drew their swords and threatened to smite them if they offered any violence to me The people also took up stones and were about to throw them at Jonathan and so they snatched me from the violence of my enemies 59 But I was going out a little way I was just upon meet ing John who was inarching with his armed men So I was afraid of him and turned aside and escaped by a narrow pas sage to the lake and seized on a ship and embarked in it and sailed over to Taricheae So beyond my expectation I escaped this danger Whereupon I presently sent for the chief of the Galileans and told them after what manner against all faith given I had been very near to destruction from Jonathan and his colleagues and the people of Tiberias Upon which the mill  titude of the Galileans were very angry and encouraged me to delay no longer to make war upon them but to permit them to go against John and utterly to destroy him as well as Jonathan and his colleagues However I restrained them though they were in such a rage and desired them to tarry a while till we should be informed what orders those ambassadors that were sent by them to the city of Jerusalem should bring thence  for 230 THE LIFE OF FLAVIUS JOSEPHUS I told them that it was best for them to act according to their de termination  whereupon they were prevailed on At which time also John when the snares he had laid did not take effect returned back to Gischala GO Now in a few days those ambassadors whom he had sent came back again and informed us that the people were greatly provoked at Ananus and Simon the son of Gamaliel and their friends  that without any public determination they had sent to Galilee and had done their endeavours that I mitjht be turned otit  O of the government The ambassadors said farther that the people were ready to burn their houses They also brought letters where by the chief men of Jerusalem at the earnest petition of the people confirmed me in the government of Galilee and enjoin Jonathan and his colleagues to return home quickly When I had gotten these letters I came to the village Arbela where I procured an assembly of the Galileans to meet and bid the am bassadors declare to them the anger of the people of Jerusalem at what had been done by Jonathan and his colleagues and how much they hated their wicked doings and how they had con firmed me in the government of their country as also what re lated to the order they had in writing for Jonathan and his col leagues to return home So I immedie tely sent them the letter and bid him that carried it to inquire as well as lie could how they intended to act on this occasion til Now when they had received that letter and were there by greatly disturbed they sent for John and for the senators of Tiberias and for the principal men of the Gabarens and propo sed to hold a council and desired them to consider what was to be done by them However the governors of Tiberias were greatly disposed to keep the government to themselves  for they said it was not fit to desert their city now it was committed td their trust and that otherwise I should not delay to fall upon them  for they pretended falsely that so I had threatened to do Now John was not only of their opinion but advised them that two of them should go to accuse me before the multitude at Je rusalem that I do not manage the affairs of Galilee as I ought to do and that they would easily persuade the people because of their dignity and because the whole multitude are very mutable When therefore it appeared that John had suggested the wisest advice to them they resolved that two of them Jonathan and A nanias should go to the people of Jerusalem and the other two Simon and Joazar should be left behind to tarry at Tiberias f They also took along with them an hundred soldiers for their guard 62 However the governors of Tiberias took care to have their city THE LIFE OF FLAVIUS JOSEPHUS Â ity secured with walls and commanded their inhabitants to take their arms They also sent for a great many soldiers from John to assist them against me if there should he occasion for them Now John was at Gischala Jonathan therefore and those that were with him when they were departed from Tiberias and as soon as they were come to Dabaritta a village that lay in the ut most parts of Galilee in the great plain they about midnight fell among the guards I had set who both commanded them to lay aside their weapons and kept them in bonds upon the placf as I had charged them to do This news was written to me by jl evi who had the command of that guard committed to him by me Hereupon I said nothing of it for two days  and pretend ing to know nothing about it I sent a message to the people of Tiberias and advised them to lay their arms aside and to dis miss their men that they might go home But supposing that Jonathan and those that were with him were already arrived at Jerusalem they made reproachful answers to me  yet was I not terrified thereby but contrived another stratagem against them for I did not think it agreeable with piety to kindle the fire of war against the citizens As I was desirous to draw those men away from Tiberias I chose out ten thousand of the best of my armed men and divided them into three bodies and ordered them to go privately and lie still as an ambush in the villages I also led a thousand into another village which lay indeed in the mountains as did the others but only four furlongs distant from Tiberias and gave order that when they saw my signal they should come down immediately while I myself lay with iny soldiers in the sight of every body Hereupon the people of Tiberias at the sight of me came running out of the city perpetually and abused me greatly Nay their madness was come to that height that they made a decent bier for me and standing about it they mourned over me in the way of jest and sp6rt and I could not but be myself in a pleasant humour upon the sight of this madness of theirs 63 And now being desirous to catch Simon by a wile and Joazar with him 1 sent a message to them and desired them to come a little way out of the city with many of their friends to guard them  for I said I would come down to them and make a league with them and divide the government of Galilee with them Accordingly Simon was deluded on account of his im prudence and out of the hopes of gain and did not delay to come but Joazar suspecting snares were laid for him staid behind So when Simon was come out and his friends with him for his guard I met him and saluted him with great civility and pro fessed that I was obliged to him for his coming up to me but a little 232 THE LIFE OF FLAVIUS JOSEFHUS little while afterward I walked along with him as though I would say something to him by himself and when I had drawn him a good way from his friends I took him about the middle and gave him to my friends that were with me to carry him into a village  and commanding my armed men to come down I wvth them made an assault upon Tiberias Now as the fight grew hot on both sides and the soldiers belonging to Tiberias were in a fair way to conquer me for my armed men were al ready fled away I saw the posture of my affairs  and encoura ging those that were with me I pursued those of Tiberias even when they were already conquerors into the city 1 also sent another band of soldiers into the city by the lake and gave them orders to set on fire the first house they could seize upon When this was done the people of Tiberias thought that their city was taken by force and so threw down their arms for fear and im plored they their wives and children that I would spare their pity So I was over persuaded by their entreaties and restrained the soldiers from the vehemency with which they pursued them  while I myself upon the coming on of the evening returned back with my soldiers and went to refresh myself I also invi ted Simon to sup with me and comforted him on occasion of what had happened  and I promised that I would send him safe and secure to Jerusalem and withal would give him provision for his journey thither  64 But on the next day I brought ten thousand men with me and came to Tiberias I then sent for the principal men of the multitude into the public place and enjoined them to tell me who were the authors of the revolt and when they had told me who the men were I sent them bound to the city Jotapa But ns to Jonathan and Ananias I freed them from their bonds and gave them provisions for their journey together with Simon and Joazar and five hundred armed men who should guard them and so I sent them to Jerusalem The people of Tiberias also came to me again and desired that I would forgive them for what they had done and they said they would amend what they had done amiss with regard to me by their fidelity for the time to come  and they besought me to preserve what spoils remain ed upon the plunder of the city for those that had lost them â Accordingly I enjoined those that had got them to bring them all before us  and when they did not comply for a great while and I saw one of the soldiers that were about me with a garment on that was more splendid than ordinary I asked him whence he had it and he replied that he had it out of the plunder of the city I had him punished with stripes and I threatened all the rest to inflict a severer punishment upon them unless they produced before THE LIFE OF FLAVIUS JOSEPHUS Â 33 before us whatsoever they had plundered and when a great many spoils were brought together I restored to every one of Tiberias what they claimed to be their own 65 And now I am come to this part of my narration I have a mind to say a few things to Justus who hath himself written an history concerning these affairs as also to others who profess to write history but have little regard to truth and are not afraid either out of ill will or good will to some persons to re late falsehoods These men do like those who compose forged deeds and conveyances  and because they are not brought to the like punishment with them they have no regard to truth When therefore Justus undertook to write about these facts and about the Jewish war that he might appear to have been an industrious man he falsified in what he related about me and could not speak truth even about his own country  whence it is that being be lied by him I am under a necessity to make my defence  and so I shall say what I have concealed till now And let no one won der that I have not told the world these things a great while ago For although it be necessary for an historian to write the truth yet is such an one not bound severely to animadvert on the wick edness of certain men  not out of any favour to them but out of an author s own moderation How then comes rt to pass O Justus  thou most sagacious of writers that I may address myself to him as if he were here present for so thou boastest of thyself that 1 and the Galileans have been the authors of that sedition which thy country engaged in both against the Romans and against the king Agrippa junior  For before ever I was appointed governor of Galilee by the community of Jerusalem both thou and all the people of Tiberias had not only taken up arms but had made war with Dccapolisof Syria Accordingly thou hadst ordered their villages to be burnt and a domestic ser vant of thine fell in the battle Nor is it I only who say this  but so it is written in the commentaries of Vespasian the empe ror as also how the inhabitants of Decapolis came clamouring to Vespasian at Ptolemais and desired that thou who wast the author of that war mightest be brought to punishment And thou hadst certainly been punished at the command of Vespasian had not king Agrippa who had power given him to have thee put to death at the earnest entreaty of his sister Bernice chan ged the punishment from death into a long imprisonment Thy political administration of affairs afterward do also clearly discover both thy other behaviour in life and that thou wast the occasion of thy country s revolt from the Romans  plain signs of which I shall produce presently 1 have also a mind to say a few things to the rest of the people of Tiberias on thy account Irt FoL HI  G g Â and THE LIFE OF FLAVIUS JOSEPHUSV and to demonstrate to those that light upon this history that you bare no good will neither to the Romans nor to the king To bs sure the greatest cities of Galilee O Justus  were Sepphoris and thy country Tiberias But Sepphoris situated in the very midst of Galilee and having many villages about it and able with ease to have been bold and troublesome to the Romans if they had so pleased yet did it resolve to continue faithful to those their masters and at the same time excluded me out of their ci ty and prohibited all their citizens from joining with the Jews in the war and that they might be out of danger from me they by a wile got leave of me to fortify their city with walls  they al so of their own accord admitted of a garrison of Roman legionsr sent them by Cestius Gallus who was then president of Syria and so had me in contempt though I was then very powerful and all were greatly afraid of me  and at the same time that the greatest of our cities Jerusalem was besieged and that temple of ours which belonged to us all was in danger of falling under the enemy s power they sent no assistance thither as not willing to have it thought they would bear arms against the Romans But as for thy country O Justus situated upon the lake of Gen nesareth and distant from Hippos thirty furlongs from Gadara sixty and from Scythppolis which was under the king s juris diction an hundred and twenty  when there was no Jewish city near it might easily have preserved its fidelity to the Romans if it had so pleased them to do  for the city and its people had plenty of weapons But as thou sayest I was then the author of thtir revolt And pray O Justus  who was that author afterwards For thou knowest that I was in the power of the Romans before Jerusalem wasbesieged and before the same time Jotapata was taken by force as well as many other fortresses and a great many of the Galileans fell in the war It was there fore then a proper time when you were certainly freed from any fear on my account to throw away your weapons and to demonstrate to the king and to the Romans that it was not of choice but as forced by necessity that you fell into the war a gainst them  but you staid till Vespasian came himself as far as your walls with his whole army  and then you did indeed lay aside your weapons out of fear and your city had for certain been taken by force unless Vespasian had complied with the king s supplication for you and had excused your madness It was not 1 therefore who was the author of this but your own inclinations to war Do not you remember how often 1 got you under my power and yet put none of you to death  nay you once fell into a tumult one against another and slew one hundred and eighty fivj of your citizens not on account of your good will THE LIFE OF FLAVIUS JOSEFHUS 235 to the king and to the Romans but en account of your own wickedness and this while 1 was besieged by the Romans in Jotapata Nay indeed were there not reckoned up two thousand of the people of Tiberias during the siege of Jerusa lem some of which were slain and the rest caught and cacried captives  But thou wilt pretend that thou didst not engage in the War since thou didst ilee to the king Yes indeed thou didst flee to him  but I say it was out of fear of me Thou sayest indeed that it is I who am a wicked man But then for what reason was it that king Agrippa who procured thee ihy life when thou wast condemned to die by Vespasian and who bestowed so muck riches upon thee did twice afterward put thee into bonds and as often obliged thee to run away from thy country and when he had once ordered thee to be put to death he granted thee a pardon at the earnest request of Bernice  and when after so many of thy wicked pranks he had made thee his secretary he caught thee falsifying his epistles and drove thee away from his sight But I shall not inquire accurately in to these matters of scandal against thee Yet cannot I but won der at thy impudence when thou hast the assurance to say that thou hast better related these affairs of the war than have all he others that have written about them whilst thou didst not know what was done in Galilee  for thou wast then at Bcrytus with the king  nor didst thou know how much the Romans sut fered at the siege of Jotapata or what miseries they brought up on us  nor couldst thou learn by inquiry what I did during that siege myself for all those that might afford such information were quite destroyed in that siege But perhaps thou wilt ay thou hast written of what was done against the people of Jerusa lem exactly But how should that be  for neither wast thou concerned in that war nor hast thou read the commentaries of Caesar  of which we have evident proof because thou hast con tradicted those commentaries of Caesar in thy history But if thou art so hardy as to affirm that thou hast written that history bstter than all the rest why didst thou not publish thy history while the emperors Vespasian and Titus the generals in that war as well as king Agrippa and his family who were men very well skilled in the learning of the Greeks were til alive  for thou hast had at written these twenty years and then mightest thou have had the testimony of thy accuracy But now when these men are no longer with us and thou thinkest thou canst not be contradicted thou venturest to publish it But then I was not in like manner afraid of my own writing but I offered any books to the emperors themselves when the facts were al Â ost under men s eyes  for I was conscious to myself that I had G g 2 observed 230 THE LIFE OF FLAV1US IOSEPHUS observed the truth of the facts  and as I expected to have their attestation to them so I was not deceived in such expectation Moreover I immediately presented my history to many other persons some of which were concerned in the war as was king Agrippa and some of his kindred Now the emperor Titus was so desirous that the knowledge of these affairs should be taken from these books alone that he subscribed his own hand to them and ordered that they should be published  and for Agrippa he wrote me sixty two letters and attested to the truth of what I had therein delivered  two of which letters I have here subjoin ed and thou mayest thereby know their contents  King A  gr PPa t0 Josephus his dear friend sendeth greeting I have f read over thy book with great pleasure and it appears to me  that thou hast done it much more accurately and with great  er care than have the other writers Send me the rest of  these books Farewell my dear friand  King Agrippa  to Josephus his dear friend sendeth greeting It seems by f what thou hast written that thou standest in need of no in i  struction in order to our information from the beginning  However when thou comest to me I will inform thee of a great  many things which thou dost not know So when this histo ry was perfected Agrippa neither by way of flattery which was not agreeable to him nor by way of irony as thou wilt say for he was entirely a stranger to such an evil disposition of mind but he wrote this by way of attestation to what was true as all that read histories may do And so much shall be said concern ing Justus which I am obliged to add by way of digression o 6 Now  The character of this history qf Justus of Tiberias the rival of our Josephus which is now losr with irs only remaining fragment are given us by a very able critic Photius who read that history It is in the 33d code of his Bibliotheca and runs thus  1 have read say s Phctius the chronology of Justus of Tiberias  whose title is this The chronolongy of  the Kings of Judith which succeeded  one another This Justus canie out of the city Tiberias in Galilee He be  gins his history from Moses and ends it not till the death of Agrippa the sc  venth ruler of the family of Herod and the last king of the Jews  who took  the government under Claudius had it augmented under Nero and still more  augmented by Vespasian He died in the third year of Trajan where also his  history ends He is very concise in his language and slightly passes ever those  alFairs that were most necessary to be insisted on and being under the Jewish prejudices as indeed he was himself also a Jew by birth he makes not the  least mention of the appearance of Christ or of what things happened to him  or of the wonderful works that he did He was the son of a certain Jew  whose name was Pittus He was a man as he is described by Josephus of a  must profligate character a slave both to money and to pleasures In public  affairs he was opposite to Josephus and it is related that he laid many plots  against him but that Jo eplius though he had this his enemy frequently under  his power did only reproach him in words and so let him go without farther  punishment He says ako that the history which this man wrote is for the  main fabulous and chiefly as to those parts where he describes the Roman  war with the Jevs and the taking of Jerusalem 1 THE LIFE OF FLAVIUS JOSEPHUS 337 G6 Now when I had settled the affairs of Tiberias and had assembled my friends as a Sanhedrim I consulted what I should do as to John Whereupon it appeared to be the opinion of all the Galileans that I should arm them all and march against John and punish him as the author of all the disorders that had happened Yet was not I pleased with their determination  as purposing to compose these troubles without bloodshed Up on this I exhorted them to use the utmost care to learn the names of all that were under John  which when they had done and I thereby was apprised who the men were I published an edict wherein I offered security and my right hand to such of John s party as had a mind to repent and I allowed twenty days time to such as would take this qiost advantageous course for them selves I also threatened that unless they threw down their arms I would burn their houses and expose their goods to pub lic sale When the men heard of this they were in no small disorder and deserted John and to the number of four thou sand threw down their arms and came to me So that no o thers staid with John but his own citizens and about fifteen hundred strangers that came from the metropolis of Tyre  and when John sawrthat he had been outwitted by my stratagem he continued afterward in his own country and was in great fear of me 67 But about this time it was that the people of Sepphoris grew insolent and took up arms out of a confidence they had in the strength of their walls and because they saw me engaged in other affairs also So they sent to Cestius Gallus who was president of Syria and desired that he would either come quick ly to them and take their city under his protection or send them a garrison Accordingly Gallus promised them to come but did not send word when he would come  and when I had learn ed so much I took the soldiers that were with me and made an assault upon the people of Sepphoris and took the city by force The Galileans took this opportunity as thinking they had now a proper time for shewing their hatred to them since they borfe ill will to that city also Then they exerted them selves as if they would destroy them all utterly with those that sojourned there also So they ran upon them and set their houses on fire as finding them without inhabitants  for the men out of fear ran together to the citadel So the Galileans carried off every thing and omitted no kind of desolation which they could bring upon their countrymen When I saw this I was exceedingly troubled at it and commanded them to leave off and put them in mind that it was not agreeable to piety to do Si ch things to their countrymen  but since they neither would hearken S38 THE LIFE OF FLAVIUS JOSEPHUS 4 hearken to what I exhorted nor to what I commanded them to do for the hatred they bore to the people there was too hard for my exhortations to them I bid those my friends who were most faithful to me and were about me to give out reports as if the Romans were falling upon the other part of the city with a great army  and this I did that by such a report s being spread abroad I might restrain the violence of the Galileans and pre serve the city of Sepphoris And at length this stratagem had its effect for upon hearing this report they were in fear for themselves and so they left off plundering and ran away  and this more especially because they saw me their general do the same also  for that I might cause this report to be believed I pretended to be in fear as well as they Thus were the inhabi tants of Sepphoris unexpectedly preserved by this contrivance of mine 68 Nay indeed Tiberias had like to have been plundered by the Galileans also upon the following occasion  The chief men of the senate wrote to the king and desired that he would come to them and take possession of their city The king promised to come and wrote a letter in answer to theirs and gave it to one of his bed chamber whose name was Crispus and who was by birth a Jew to carry it to Tiberias When the Galileans knew that this man carried such a letter they caught him and brought him to me  but as soon as the whole multitude heard of it they were enraged and betook themselves to their arms So a great many of them got together from all quarters the next day and came to the city Asochis where I then lodged and made heavy clamours and called the city of Tiberias a traitor to them and a friend to the king  and desired leave of me to go down and utterly destroy it for they bore the like ill will to the people of Tiberias as they did to those of Sep phoris 69 When I heard this I was in doubt what to do and he sitated by what means I might deliver Tiberias from the rage of the Galileans  for I could not deny that those of Tiberias had written to the king and invited him to come to them  for his letters to them in answer thereto would fully prove the truth of that So 1 sat a long while musing with myself and then said to them  I know well enough that the people of  Tiberias have offended  nor shall I forbid you to plunder the Â city However such things ought to be done with discretion   for they of Tiberias have not been the only betrayers of our  liberty but many of the most eminent patriots of the Gah  leans as they pretended to be have done the same Tarry  therefore till I shall thoroughly find out those authors of our  danger THE LIFE OF FLAVIUS JOSEPHUS 539 u danger and then you shall have them all at once under your  power with all such as you shall yourselves bring in also Upon my saying this I pacified the multitude and they left oft their anger and went their ways  and I gave orders that he who brought the king s letters should be put into bonds  but in a few days I pretended that I was obliged by a necessary affair of my own to go out of the kingdom I then called Crispus privately and ordered him to make the soldier that kept him drunk and to run away to the king So when Tiberias was in danger of being utterly destroyed a second time it escaped the danger by my skilful management and the care that I had for its preser vation 70 About this time it was that Justus the son of Pistus without my knowledge ran away to the king the occasion of which I will here relate Upon the beginning of the war be tween the Jews and the Romans the people of Tiberias re solved to submit to the king and not to revolt from the Ro mans  while Justus tried to persuade them to betake themselves to their arms as being himself desirous of innovations and having hopes of obtaining the government of Galilee as well as of his own country Tiberias also Yet did he not obtain what he hoped for  because the Galileans bore ill will to those of Tiberias and on this account of their anger at what miseries they had suffered from them before the war  thence it was that they would not endure that Justus should be their governor I myself also who had been intrusted by the community of Jeru salem with the government of Galilee did frequently come to that degree of rage at Justus that I had almost resolved to kill him as not able to bear his mischievous disposition He was therefore much afraid of me lest at length my passion should come to extremity  so he went to the king as supposing that he should dwell better and more safely with him 71 Now when the people of Sepphoris had in so surprising a manner escaped their first danger they sent to Cestius Gal lus and desired him to come to them immediately and take possession of their city or else to send forces sufficient to repress all their enemies incursions upon them  and at the last they did prevail with Gallus to send them a considerable army both of horse and foot which came in the night time and which they admitted into the city But when the country round a bout it was harassed by the Roman army I took those soldiers that were about me and came to Garisme where I cast up a bank a good way off the city Sepphoris  and when I was at twenty furlongs distance I came upon it by night and made an assault upon its walls with my forces and when I had or dered 340 THE LIFE OF FLAVIUS JOSEPHUS dered a considerable number of my soldiers to scale them with ladders 1 became master of the greatest part of the city But soon after our unacquaintedness with the places forced us to re tire after we had killed twelve of the Roman footmen and two horsemen and a few of the people of Sepphoris with the less of only a single man of our own And when it afterward came to a battle in the plain against the horsemen and we had un dergone the dangers of it courageously for a long time we were beaten  for upon the Romans encompassing me about my sol diers were afraid and fled back There fell in that battle one of those that had been intrusted to guard my body his name was Justus who at this time had the same post with the king At the same time also there came forces both horsemen and footmen from the king and Sylla their commander who was the captain of this guard  this Sylla pitched his camp at five furlongs distance from Julias and set a guard upon the roads both that which led to Cana and that which led to the fortress Gamala that he might hinder their inhabitants from getting provisions out of Galilee 72 As soon as I had gotten intelligence of this I sent two thousand armed men and a captain over them whose name was Jtremiab who raised a bank a furlong off Julias near to the river Jordan and did no more than skirmish with the enemy  till I took three thousand soldiers myself and came to them But on the next day when I had laid an ambush in a certain valley not far from the banks I provoked those that belong ed to the king to come to a battle and gave orders to rny own soldiers to turn their backs upon them until they should have drawn the enemy away from their camp and brought them out into the field which was done accordingly  for Sylla sup posing that our party did really run away was ready to pursue them when our soldiers that lay in ambush took them on their backs and put them all into great disorder I also imme diately made a sudden turn with my own forces and met those of the king s party and put them to flight And I had performed great things that day if a certain fate had not been my hindrance  for the horse on which I rode and upon whose back 1 fought fell into a quagmire and threw me on the ground and I was bruised on my wrist and carried into a village named Cepharnome or Capernaum When my soldiers heard of this they were afraid I had been worse hurt than I was  and so they did not go on with their pursuit any further but returned in very great concern for me I there fore sent for the physicians and while 1 was under their hand THE LIFE OF FLAVIU S JOSEPHUS 241 Hand I continued feverish that day  and as the physicians di rected I was that night removed to Taricheae T3 When Sylla and his party were informed what happened to me they took courage again  and understanding that the watch was negligently kept in our camp they by night placed a body of horsemen in ambush beyond Jordan and when it was day they provoked us to fight and as we did not refuse it but came into the plain their horsemen appeared out of that ambush in which they had lain and put our men into disorder and made them run away so they slew six men of our side Yet did they not go off with the victory at last for when they heard that some armed men were sailed from Taricheae to Julias they were afraid and retired 14 It was not now long before Vespasian came to Tyre and king Agrippa with him  but the Tyrians began to speak re proachfully of the king and called him an enemy to the Ro mans For they said that Philip the general of his army had betrayed the royal palace and the Roman forces that were in Jerusalem and that it was done by his command When Ves pasian heard of this report he rebuked the Tyrians for abusing a man who was both a king and a friend to the Romans but he exhorted the king to send Philip to Rome to answer for what he had done before Nero But when Philip was sent thither he did not come into the sight of Nero for he found him very near death on account of the troubles that then happened and a civil war  and so he returned to the king But when Vespasian was come to Ptolemais the chief men of Decapolis of Syria made a clamour against Justus of Tiberias because he had set their villages 6n fire  so Vespasian delivered him to the king to be put to death by those under the king s jurisdiction  yet did the king only put him into bonds and concealed what he had done from Vespasian as I have before related But the people of Sepphoris met Vespasian and saluted him and had forces sent him with Placidus their commander he also went up with them as I also followed them till Vespasian came into Galilee As to which coming of his and after what manner it was or dered and how he fought his first battle with me near the vil lage Taricheae and how from thence they went to Jotapata and how I was taken alive and bound and how I was afterward loosed with all that was done by me in the Jewish war and during the siege of Jerusalem  I have accurately related them in the books concerning the War of the Jews However it v ill I think be fit for me to add now an account of those ac tions of my life which I have not related in that book of the Jewish War VOL III H h 75 242 THE LIFE OF FLAVIUS JOSEPHUS 75 For when the siege of Jotapata was over and I was among the Romans I was kept with much care by means of the great respect that Vespasian shewed me Moreover at his command I married a virgin  who was from among the captives of that country  yet did she not live with me long but was divorced npon my being freed from my bonds and my going to Alex andria However I married another wife at Alexandria and was thence sent together with Titus to the siege of Jerusalem and was frequently in danger of being put to death  while both the Jews were very desirous to get me under their power in order to have me punished And the Romans also whenever they were beaten supposed that it was occasioned by my treachery and made continual clamours to the emperors and desired that they would bring me to that punishment as a traitor to them  but Titus Caesar was well acquainted with the uncertain fortune of war and returned no answer to the soldiers vehement solicitations against me Moreover when the city Jerusalem was taken by force Titus Caesar persuaded me frequently to take whatsoever I would of the ruins of my country and said that he gave me leave so to do But when my country was destroyed I thought nothing else to be of any value which I could take and keep as a comfort under my calamities  so I made this request to Titus that my family might have their liberty  I had also the holy books f by Titus s concession Nor was it long after that I asked of him the life of my brother and of fifty friends with him and was not de nied When I also went once to the temple by the permission of Titus where there were a great multitude of captive women and children  I got all those that I remembered as among my own friends and acquaintance to be set free being in number about one hundred and ninety  and so I delivered them without their paying any price of redemption and restored them to their former fortune And when I was sent by Titus Caesar with Cerealius and a thousand horsemen to a certain village called Thccoa in order to know whether it were a place fit for a camp as I came back I saw many captives crucified and remembered three of them as my former acquaintance 1 was very sorry at this Â Here Josephus a priest honestly confesses that he

Titus and told him of them  so he immediately commanded them to be taken down and to have the greatest care taken of them in or der to their recovery  yet two of them died under the physi cian s hands while the third recovered 16 But when Titus had composed the troubles in Judea and conjectured that the lands which Ihad in Judea Would bring me in no profit because a garrison to guard the country was after ward to pitch there he gave me another country in the plain And when he was going away to Rome he made choice of mt to sail along with him and paid me great respect and when we were come to Rome I had great care taken of me by Ves pasian  for he gave me an apartment in his own house which he lived in before he came to the empire He also honoured me with the privilege of a Roman citizen and gave me an annual pension  and continued to respect me to the end of his life without any abatement of his kindness to me  which very thing made me envied and brought me into danger for a cer tain Jew whose name was Jonathan who had raised a tumult in Cyrene and had persuaded two thousand men of that country to join with him was the occasion of their ruin But when he was bound by the governor of that country and sent to the em peror he told him that I had sent him both weapons and mo ney However he could not conceal his being a liar from Ves pasian who condemned him to die  according to which sentence he was put to death Nay after that when those that envied my good fortune did frequently bring accusations against me by God s providence I escaped them all I also received from Ves pasian no small quantity of land as free gift in Judea about which time I divorced mv wife also as not pleased with her be haviour though not till she had been the mother of three chil dren two of which are dead and one whom I named Hyrca nus is alive After this I married a wife who had lived at Crete but a Jew by birth  a woman she was of eminent parents and such as were the most illustrious in all the country and whose character was beyond that of most other women as her future life did demonstrate By her I had two sons the elder s name was Justus and the next Simonides who was also named Agrippa And these were the circumstances of my domestic affairs However the kindness of the emperor to me continued still the same  for when Vespasian was dead Titus who suc ceeded him in the government kept up the same respect for me which I had from his father and when I had frequent accusa tions laid against me he would not believe them And Domi tian who succeeded still augmented his respects to me  for he H h 2 punished 244 TfiE LIFE OF FLAVIOS JOSEFHUS punished those Jews that were my accusers and gave command that a servant of mine who was an eunuch and my accuser should be punished He also made that country I had in Judea tax free which is a mark of the greatest honour to him who hath it nay Domitia the wife of Caesar continued to do me kindnesses And this is the account of the actions of my whole life  and let others judge of my character by them as they please But to thee O Epaphroditus  thou most excellent of men do I dedicate all this treatise of our Antiquities  and so for the pre sent I here conclude the whole Â Of this Epaphroditus see the note on the Preface to the Anti juities THE WARS OF THE JEWS OR THE HISTORY OF THE DESTRUCTION OF JERUSALEM PREFACE  1  V1T HEREAS the war which the Jews made with the  Romans hath been the greatest of all those not only that have been in our times but in a manner of those that ever were heard of both of those wherein cities have fought against cities or nations against nations while some men who were not concerned in the affairs themselves have gotten toge ther vain and contradictory stories by hearsay and have written them down after a sophistical manner and while those that were there present have given false accounts of things and this either out of a humour of flattery to the Romans or of hatred towards the Jews and while their writings contain sometimes accusa tions and sometimes encomiums but no where the accurate truth of the facts  I have proposed to myself for the sake of such as live under the government of the Romans to translate those books into the Greek tongue which I formerly composed in the language  I have already observed more than once that this history of the Jewish war wai Josephus s first work and published about A D 75 when he was but 38 years of age and that when he wrote it he was not thoroughly acquainted with several circumstances of history from the days of Antiochus Epiphanes with vrhich it begins till near his own times contained in the first and former part of the second book and so committed many involuntary errors therein That he published his Antiquities 18 years afterward perused those most authentic histories the first book of Maccabees in the rjth year of Domitian A D 93 when he was much more completely acquainted with those ancient times and after he had wrote the Chronicles of the Priesthood of John Hyrcanus c â That accordingly he then reviewed those parts of this work and gave the pub Jic a more faithful complete and accurate account of the facts therein related  aui d honestly corrected the errors he had before run into 246 PREFACE language of our country and sent to the Upper Barbarians  I Joseph the son of Matthias by birth an Hebrew a priest also and one who at first fought against the Romans myself and was forced to be present at what was done afterwards am the author of this work 2 Now at the time when this great concussion of affairs happen ed the affairs of the Romans were themselves in great disorder Those Jews also who were for innovations then arose when the limes were disturbed  they were also in a flourishing condition for strength and riches insomuch that the affairs of the east were then exceeding tumultuous while some hoped for gain and others were afraid of loss in such troubles  for the Jews hoped that all of their nation which were beyond Euphrates would have raised an insurrection together with them The Galls al so in the neighbourhood of the Romans were in motion and the Celta e were not quiet  but all was in disorder after the death of Nero And the opportunity now offered induced many to aim at the royal power  and the soldiery affected change out of the hopes of getting money L thought it therefore an absurd thing to see the truth falsified in affairs of such great consequence and to take no notice of it but to suffer those Greeks and Ro mans that were not in the wars to be ignorant of these things and to read either flatteries or fictions while the Parthians and the Babylonians and the remotest Arabians and those of our nation beyond Euphrates with the Adiabeni by my means knew accu rately both whence the war begun what miseries it brought upon us and after what manner it ended 3 It is true these writers have the confidence to call their accounts histories  wherein yet they seem to me to fail of their own purpose as well as to relate nothing that is found For they have a mind to demonstrate the greatness of the Romans while they still diminish and lessen the actions of the Jews as not discerning how it cannot be that those must appear to be great who have only conquered those that were little Nor are they ashamed to overlook the length of the war the multitude of the Roman forces who so greatly suffered in it or the might of the commanders whose great labours about Jerusalem will be deemed inglorious if what they atchieved be reckoned but a small matter 4 However  Who these Upper Barbarians remote from the sea were Josephus himself will inform us sect 2 viz the Parthians and Babylonians and remotest Arabi ans or the Jews among them  besides the Jews beyond Euphrates and the Adiabeni or Assyrians Whence we also learn that these Parthians Babylo nians the remotest Arabians or at least the Jews among them as also the Jews beyond Euphrates and tiie Adiibeni or Assyrians understood Josephus s Hebrew or rather Chaldiac books of the Jewish War before they were put into the Greek language  PREFACE 247 4 However I will not go to the other extreme out of op position to those men who extol the Romans nor will I determine to raise the actions of my countrymen too high  but I will pro secute the actions of both parties with accuracy Yet shall I suit my language to the passions I am under as to the affairs I describe and must be allowed to indulge some lamentations upon the miseries undergone by my own country For that it was a se ditious temper of our own that destroyed it and that they were the tyrants among the Jews who brought the Roman power upon us who unwillingly attacked us and occasioned the burning of our holy temple Titus Caesar who destroyed it is himself a witness who during the entire war pitied the people who were kept under by the seditious and did often voluntarily delay the taking of the city and allowed time to the siege in order to let the authors have opportunity for repentance But if any one makes an unjust accusation against us when we speak so passion ately about the tyrants or the robbers or sorely bewail the mis fortunes of our country let him indulge my affections herein though it be contrary to the rules for writing history  because it had so come to pass that our city Jerusalem had arrived at au higher degree of felicity than any other city under the Roman government and yet at last fell into the sorest of calamities again Accordingly it appears to me that  the misfortunes of all men from the beginning of the world if they be compared to these of the Jews are not so considerable as they were while the authors of them were not foreigners neither This makes it impossible for me to contain my lamentations But if any pne be inflexi ble in his censures of me let him attribute the facts themselves to the historical part and the lamentations to the writer him self only 5 However I may justly blame the learned men among the Greeks who when such great actions have been done in their own times which upon the comparison quite eclipse the old wars do yet sit as judges of those affairs and pass bitter censures upon the labours of the best writers of antiquity which mo derns although they may be superior to the old writers in elo quence yet are they inferior to them in the execution of what they intended to do While these also write new histories about the Assyrians and Medes as if the ancient writers had not de scribed their affairs as they ought to have done  although these be as far inferior to them in abilities as they are different in their  That these calamities of the Jews who were our Saviour s murderers were to be the greatest that had ever been since the beginning of the world our Sa viour had directly foretold Matt xxiv n Mark xiii 19 Luke xxi 23 24  and that the proved to be such accordingly Josephus is here a most authentic Witness 248 PREFACE thÂ ir notions from them For of old every one took upon th eni to write what happened in his own time  where their imme diate concern in the actions made their promises of value  and where it must be reproachful to write lies when they must be known by the readers to be such But then an undertaking to preserve the memory of what hath not been before recorded and to represent the affairs of one s own time to those that come af terwards is really worthy of praise and commendation Now he is to be esteemed to have taken good pains in earnest not who does no more than change the disposition and order of other men s works but he who not only relates what had not been re lated before but composes an entire body of history of his own  accordingly I have been at great charges and have taken very great pains about this history though I be a foreigner  and do dedicate this work as a memorial of great actions both to the Greeks and to the Barbarians But for some of our own prin cipal men their mouths are wide open and their tongues loosed presently for gain and law suits but quite muzzled up when they are to write history where they must speak truth and ga ther facts together with a great deal of pains  and so they leave the writing such histories to weaker people and to such as are not acquainted with the actions of princes Yet shall the real truth of historical facts be preferred by us how much soever it be neglected among the Greek historians 6 To write concerning the Antiquities of the Jews who they were originally and how they revolted from the Egyp tians and what country they travelled over and what country they seized upon afterward and how they were removed out of them I think this not to be a fit opportunity and on other ac counts also superfluous and this because many Jews before me have composed the histories of our ancestors very exactly j as have some of the Greeks done it also and have translated our histories into their own tongue and have not much mistaken the truth in their histories But then where the writers of these af fairs and our prophets leave off thence shall I take my rise and begin my history Now as to what concerns thatwar which happened in my own time 1 will go over it very largely and with all the diligence I am able  but for what preceded mine own age that I shall run over briefly 7 For example I shall relate how Antiochus who was named Epiphanes took Jerusalem by force and held it three years and three months and was then ejected out of the country by the sons of Asamoneus  after that how their posterity quar relled about the government and brought upon their settlement the Romans and Pompey  how Herod also ths son of Antipa ter PREFACE 24 ter dissolved their government and brought Sosius upon them  as also how our people made a sedition upon Herod s death while Augustus was the Roman emperor and Quintilius Varus was in that country  and how the war broke out in the twelfth year of Nero with what happened to Cestius  and what places the Jews assaulted in an hostile manner in the first sallies of the war 8 As also p shall relate how they built walls about the neighbouring cities  and how Nero upon Cestius s defeat was in fear of the entire event of the war and thereupon made Ves pasian general in this war  and how this Vespasian with the  elder of his sons made an expedition into the country of Judea  what was the number of the Roman army that he made use of  and how many of his auxiliaries were cut off in all Galilee  and how he took some of its cities entirely and by force and others of them by treaty and on terms Now when I come so far I shall describe the good order of the Romans in war and the discipline of their legions  the amplitude cf both the Galilees with its nature and the limits of Judea And besides this I shall particularly go over what is peculiar to the country the lakes and fountains that are in them and what miseries happened to every city as they were taken  and all this with accuracy as I saw the things done or suffered in them For 1 shall not conceal any of the calamities I myself endured since I shall relate them to such as know the truth of them 9 After this I shall relate how when the Jews affairs were become very bad Nero died and Vespasian when he was going to attack Jerusalem was called back to take the govern ment upon him  what signs happened to him relating to his gaining that government and what mutations of government then happened at Rome and how he was unwillingly made emperor by his soldiers and how upon his departure to ligypt to take upon him the government of the empire the affairs of the Jews became very tumultuous  as also how the tyrants rose up against them and fell into dissensions amongst themselves 10 Moreover I shall relate how Titus marched out of Egypt into Judea the second time  as also how and where and how many forces he got together  apd in what state the city was by the means of the seditious at his coming what attacks he maie and how many ramparts he c j st up  of the three walls that en compassed the city and of their measures  of the strength of the city and the structure of the temple and holy house  and be sides the measures of those edifices and of the altar and all ac curately determined A description also of certain of their III I i festivals  Titus 25O KtEPACT festivals and  seven purifications of purity and the sacred1 ministrations of the priests with the garments of the priests and of the high priests  and of the nature of the most holy place of the temple without concealing any thing or adding any thing to the known truth of things 11 After this I shall relate the barbarity of the tyrants to wards the people of their own nation as well as the indulgence of the Romans in sparing foreigners  and how often Titus out of his desire to preserve the city and the temple invited the se ditious to come to terms of accommodation I shall also distin guish the sufferings of the people and their calamities how far they were afflicted by the sedition and how far by the fa mine and at length were taken Nor shall omit to mention the misfortunes of the deserters nor the punishments inflicted on the captives as also how the temple was burnt against the consent of Caesar and how many sacred things that had been laid up in the temple were snatched out of the fire  and the de struction also of the entire city with the signs and wonders that went before it and the taking the tyrants captives and the multitude of those that were made slaves and into what different misfortunes they were every one distributed Moreover what the Romans did to the remains of the war  and how they de molished the strong holds that were in the country and how Titus went over the whole country and settled its affairs  to gether with his return into Italy and his triumph 12 I have comprehended all these things in seven books and have left no occasion for complaint or accusation to such as have been acquainted with this war and I have written it down for the sake of those that love truth but not for those that please themselves with fictitious relations And I will begin my ac count of these things with what I call my First Chapter  Tbe e seven or rather five degrees of purily or purification are enumera ted hereafter B V ch v sect 6 The rabbins make ten degrees of them aÂ StUnd there informs Us BOOK Chap  WA S OF THE JEWS 251 BOOK I Containing the interval of one hundred fixty feven years From the taking of Jerusalem By Antiochus Epiphanes to the death of Herod the Great J CHAP L How the city Jerusalem was taken and the temple pillaged ly An tiochus Epiphanes As also concerning the actions of the Mac cabees Matthias and Judas and concerning the death of Ju das i i AT the same time that Antiochus who is called Epipha res had a quarrel with the sixth Ptolemy about his right to the whole country of Syria a great sedition fell among the men of power in Judea and they had a contention about ob taining the government while each of those that were of digni ty could not endure to be subject to their equals However O nias one of the high priests got the better and ca st the sons of Tobias out of the city who fled to Antiochus and besought him to make use of them for his leaders and to make an expedition into Judea The king being thereto disposed beforehand com plied with them and came upon the Jews with a great army and took their city by force and slew a great multitude of those that favoured Ptolemy and sent out his soldiers to plunder them with out mercy He also spoiled the temple and put a stop to the constant practice of offering a daily sacrifice of expiation for three years and six months ButOni s the high priest fled to Ptole my and received a place from him in the Nomus of Heliopolis where he built a city resembling Jerusalem and a temple that was like  its temple  concerning which we shall speak more in its proper place hereafter 2 Now Antiochus was not satisfied either with his unexpect ed taking the city or with its pillage or with the great slaugh ter he had made there  but being overcome with his violent passions and remembering what he had suffered during the siege he compelled the Jews to dissolve the laws of their country and I i 2 to  I see little difference in the several accounts in Josephus about the Egyptian tÂ mple Onion of which large complaints are made by his commentators Onias it seems hoped to have made it very like that at Jerusalem and of the same di mensions and so he appears to have really done as tar as he was able and thought proper Of this temple see Antiq B XUI chap iii sect i i 3 and Of the War B VII ch x sect 3 Â 32 Book T WARS OF THE JEWS to keep their infants uncircumcised and to sacrifice swine s flesh upon the altar against which they all opposed themselves and the most approved among them were put to death Bacchides also who was sent to keep the fortresses having these wicked commands joined to his own natural barbarity indulged all sorts of the extremest wickedness and tormented the worthiest of the inhabitants man by man and threatened the city every day with open destruction  till at length he provoked the poor sufferers by the extremity of his wicked doings to avenge themselves 3 Accordingly Matthias the son of Asamonus one of the priests who lived in a village called Modin armed himself toge ther with his own famil which had five sons of his in it and slew Bacchadas with daggers  and thereupon out of the fear of the many garrisons of the enemy he fled to the mountains and so many of the people followed him that he was encoura ged to come down from the mountains and to give battle to An tiochus s generals when he beat them and drove them out of Ju dea So he came to the government by this his success and became the prince of his own people by their own free consent and then died leaving the government to Judas his eldest son 4 Now Judas supposing that Antiochus would not lie still gathered an army out of his own countrymen and was the first that made a league of friendship with the Romans and drove Kpighanes out of the country when he had made a second expe dition into it and this by giving him a great defeat there  and when he was warmed by this great success he made an assault upon the garrison that was in the city for it had not been cut off hitherto  so he ejected them out of the Upper City and drove the soldiers into the Lower which part of the city was called the Citadel He then got the temple under his power and cleansed the whole place and walled it round about and made new ves sels forsacred ministrations and brought theminto thetemple be cause the former vessels had been profaned  He also built ano ther altar and began to offer the sacrifices  and when the city had already received its sacred constitution again Antiochus died  whose son Antiochus succeeded him in the kingdom and in his hatred to the Jews also 5 So this Antiochus eot together fiftv thousand footmen and jive thousand horsemen and fourscore elephants and marched through Judea into the mountainous parts He then took Beth sura which was a small city  but at a place called Bethzacha rias where the passage vyas narrow Judas met him with his army However before the forces joined battle Judas s brother Eleai zar steingthc very highest of the elephants adorned with a large tower and with military trappings of gold to guard him and sup posing Chap IT WARS OF THE JEWS 253 posing that Antiochus himself was upon him he ran a great I Â way before his own army and cutting his way through the ene mies troops he got up to the elephant yet could not reach him who seemed to be the king by reason of his being so high  but still he ran his weapon into the belly of the beast and brought him down upon himself and was crushed to death having done no moire than attempted great things and shewed that he pre ferred glory before life Now he that governed the elephant was but a private man and had he proved to be Antiochus Eleazar had performed nothing more by this bold stroke than that it might appear he chose to die when he had the bare hope of thereby doing a glorious action  nay this disappointment pro ved an omen to his brother Judas how the entire battle would end It is true that the Jews fought it out bravely for a long time but the king s forces being superior in number and having fortune on their side obtained the victory And when a great many of his men were slain Judas took the rest with him and fled to the toparchy of Gophra So Antiochus went to Jerusa lem and staid there but a few days for he wanted provisions and so he went his way He left indeed a garrison behind him such as he thought sufficient to keep the place but drew the rest of his army off to take their winter quarters in Syria 6 Now after the king was departed Judas was not idle  for as many of his own nation came to him so did he gather those that had escaped out of the battle together and gave battle again to Antiochus s generals at a village called Adasa  and being too hard for his enemies in the battle and killed a great number of them he was at last himself slain also Nor was it many days afterward that his brother John had a plot laid against him by Antiochus s party and was slain by them CHAP II Concerning the successors of Judas ivho were Jonathan and Simeon t and John Hyrcanus  1 T7 HEN Jonathan who was Judas s brother succeeded v r him he behaved himself with great circumspection in other respects with relation to his own people  and he corro borated his authority by preserving his friendship with the Ro mans He also made a league with Antiochus the son Yet was not all this sufficient for his security  for the tyrant Trypho who was guardian to Antiochus s son laid a plot against him  and besides that endeavoured to take of his friends and caught Jo natb an by a wile as he was going to Ptolemais to Antiochus jyith a few persons in his company and put them in bonds and then S54 WARS OF THE JRW3 Book I then made an expedition against the Jews  but when he was af terward driven away by Simeon who was Jonathan s brother and was enraged at his defeat he put Jonathan to death 2 However Simeon managed the public affairs after a cou rageous manner and took Gazara and Joppa and Jamnia which were cities in the neighbourhood He also got the garrison un der and demolished the citadel He was afterward an auxiliary to Antiochus against Trypho whom he besieged in Dora before lie went on his expedition against the Medes  yet could not he make the king ashamed of his ambition though he had assisted him in killing Trypho  for it was not long ere Antiochus sent Cendebeus his general with an army to lay waste Judea and to subdue Simeon  yet he though he were now in years conduct ed the war as if he were a much younger man He also sent his hons with a band of strong men against Antiochus while he took part of the army himself with him and fell upon him from ano ther quarter  lie also laid a great many men in ambush in many places of the mountains and was superior in all his attacks upon them  and when he had been conqueror after so glorious a man ner he was high priest and also freed the Jews from the domi nion of the Macedonians after an hundred and seventy years of the empire of Seleucus 3 This Simeon also had a plot laid against him and was slain at a feast by his son in law Ptolemy who put his wife and two sons into prison and sent some persons to kill John who was al so  called Hyrcanus But when the young man was informed of their coming beforehand he made haste to get to the city as having a very great confidence in the people there both on ac count of the memory of the glorious actions of his father and of the hatred they could not but bear to the injustice of Ptolemy Ptolemy also made an attempt to get into the city by another gate  but was repelled by the people who had just then admit ted Hyrcanus  so he retired presently to one of the fortresses that were about Jericho which was called Dagon Now when Hyrcanus had received the high priesthood which Uis father had held before and had offered sacrifice to God he made great haste to attack Ptolemy that he might afford relief to his mother and brethren 4 So he laid siege to the fortress and was superior to Ptolemy in  Why this Johntbe son of Simeon the high priest and governor of the Jews was called Hyrcanus Josephus no where informs us nor is he called other than John at the end of the first book of the Maccabees However Sixtus Senensis when he gives us an epitome of the Greek version of the book here abridged by Josephus or of the Chronicles of this John Hyrcanus then extant assures us that he was called Hyrcanus from his conquest of one of that name See Authent Rec  Part I p 27 Bat of this younger Antiochus see Dean Aldrich s note here Chap II WARS OF THE JEWS 255 in other respects but was overcome by him as to the Just af fection he had for his relations  for when Ptolemy was dis tressed he brought forth his mother and his brethren and set them upon the wall and beat them with rods in every body s sight and threatened that unless he would go away immediate ly he would throw them down headlong  at which sight Hyr canus s commiseration and concern were too hard for his anger But his mother was not dismayed neither at the stripes she re ceived nor at the death with which she was threatened  but stretched out her hands and prayed her son not to be moved with the injuries that she had suffered to spare the wretch  since it was to her better to die by the means of Ptolemy than to live ever so long provided he might be punished for the injuries he had done to their family Now John s case was this  when he considered the courage of his mother and heard her entreaty he set about his attacks  but when he saw her beaten and torn to pieces withthe stripes he grew feeble and was entirely over come by his affections And as the seige was delayed by this means the year of rest came on upon which the Jews rest every seventh year as they do on every seventh day On this year therefore Ptolemy was freed from being besieged and slew the brethren of John with their mother and fled to Zeno who wa also called Cotylas who was the tyrant of Philadelphia 5 And now Antiochus was so angry at what he had suffered from Simon that he made an expedition into Judea and sat down before Jerusalem and besieged Hyrcanus  but Hyrcanus opened the sepulchre of David who was the richest of all kings and took thence about three thousand talents in money and in duced Antiochus by the promise of three thousand talents to raise the siege Moreover he was the first of the Jews that had money enough and began to hire foreign auxiliaries also 6 However at another time when Antiochus was gone upon an expedition against the Medes and so gave Hyrcanus an op portunity of being revenged upon him he immediately made an attack upon the cities of Syria as thinking what proved ta be the case with them that they would find them empty of good troops So he took Medeba and Samea with the towns in their neighbourhood as also Sechem and Gerizaim and besides thess he subdued the nation of the Chutheans who dwelt round about that temple which was built in imitation of the temple at Jeru salem  he also took a great many other cities of Idumea with Adoreon and Marissa 7 He also proceeded as far as Samaria where is now the city Sebaste which was built by Herod the king and encom passed it all round with a wall and set his sons Aristobulus and Anti gonuSj 256  WARS OF THE JEWS Book I Antigonus over the siege  who pushed it on so hard that a fa mine so far prevailed within the city that they were forced to eat what never was esteemed food They also invited Anti ochus who was called Cyzicenus to come to their assistance  whereupon he got ready and complied with their invitation but was beaten by Aristobulus and Antigonus  and indeed he Was pursued as far as Scythopolis by these brethren and fled away from them So they returned back to Samaria and shut the multitude again within the wall and when they had taken the city they demolished it and made slaves of its inhabitants And as they had still great success in their undertakings they did not suffer their zeal to cool but marched with an army as far as Scythopolis and made an incursion upon it aud laid waste all the country that lay within Mount Carmel 8 But then these successes of John and of his sons made them be envied and occasioned a sedition in the country and many there were who got together and would not be at rest till they brake out into open war in which war they were beaten So John lived the rest of his life very happily and administered the government after a most extraordinary manner and this for thir ty three entire years together He died leaving five sons be hind him He was certainly a very happy man and afforded no occasion to have any complaint made of fortune on his account He it was who alone had three of the most desirable things in the world the government of his nation and the high priest hood and the gift of prophecy For the Deity conversed with him and he was not ignorant of any thing that was to come af terward  insomuch that he foresaw and foretold that his two eldest sons would not continue masters of the government  and it will highly deserve our narration to describe their catas trophe and how far inferior these men were to their father in felicity CHAP III How Aristobulus wa t the Jirst that put a diadem about Ms lead and after he had put his mother and brother to dsath died him self when he had reigned no more than a year Â 1 T OR after the death of their father the elder of them A  ristobnlus changed the government into a kingdom and was the first that put a diadem upon his head four hundred se venty and one years and three months after oar people came down into this country when they were set free from the Baby lonian slavery Now of his brethren he appeared to have an af fection for Antigonus who was next to him and made him his ermal  but for the rest he bound them and pnt them in prison He  III WARS OF THE JEWS He also put his mother in bonds for her contesting the govern ment with him for John had left her to be the governess of public affairs He also proceeded to that degree of barbarity as to cause her to be pined to death in prison 2 But vengeance circumvented him in the affiiir of his bro ther Antigonus whom he loved and whom he made his part ner in the kingdom for he slew him by the means of the qalum nies which ill men about the palace contrived against him At first indeed Aristobulus would not believe their reports partly out of the affection he had for his brother and partly because he thought that a great part of these tales were owing to the en  vy of their relaters however as Antigonus came once in a splendid manner from the army to that festival wherein our ancient custom is to make tabernacles for God it happened ill those days that Aristobulus was sick and that at the conclu sion of the feast Antigonus came up to it with his armed men about him and this when he was adorned in the finest manner possible and that in a great measure to pray to God on the behalf of his brother Now at this very time it was that these ill men came to the king and told him in what a pompous man ner the armed men came and with what insolence Antigonus marched and that such his insolence was too great for a private person and that accordingly he was come with a great band of men to kill him  for that he could not endure this bare enjoy ment of royal honour when it was in his power to take the kingdom himself 3 Now Aristobulus by degrees and unwillingly gave credit to these accusations  and accordingly he took care not to disco ver his suspicion openly though he provided to be secure against any accidents  so he placed the guards of his body in a certain dark subterranean passage  for he lay sick in a place called for merly the Citadel though afterwards its name was changed to Antonia and he ga ve orders that if Antigonus came unarmed they should let him alone  but if he came to him in his armour they should kill him He also sent some to let him know before hand that he should come unarmed But upon this occasion the queen very cunningly contrived the matter with those that plotted his ruin for she persuaded those that were sent to con ceal the king s message  but to tell Antigonus how his brother had heard he had got a very fine suit of armour made with fine martial ornaments in Galilee  and because his present sickness hindered him from coming and seeing all that finery he very much desired to see him now in his armour because said he in 3 little time thou art going away from me 4 As soon as Antigonus heard this the good temper of his VOL III K k  brother 558 WARS OF THE JEWS Book I brother not allowing him to suspect any harm from him he came along with his armour on to shew it to his brother but when he was going along that dark passage which was called Strato s Tower he was slain by the body guards and became an eminent instance how calumny destroys all good will and natural affection and how none of our good affections are strong enough to resist enyy perpetually 5 And truly any one would be surprised at Judas upon this occasion He was of the sect of the Es sens and had never failed or deceived men in his predictions before Now this man saw Antigonus as he was passing along by the temple and cried out lp his acquaintance they were not a few who attended upon liim as his scholars  P strange said he it is good for me to V die now since truth is dead before me and somewhat that I  have foretold hath proved false  for this Antigonus is this day  alive who ought to have died this day  and the place where Â he ought to be slain according to that fatal decree was Strato s  Tower whrch is at the distance of six hundred furlongs from Â this place  and yet four hours of this day are over already V which point of time renders the prediction impossible to be  fulfilled A nd when the old man had said this he was de jected in hi mind and so continued But in a little time news came that Antigonus was slain in a subterraneous place which was itself also called Strato s Tower by the same name with thai Cesarea which lay by the serf side and this ambiguity it was which caused the prophet s disorder     6 Hereupon Aristohulus repented of the great crime he had been guilty of and this gave occasion to the increase of his dis femper He also grew worse and worse and his soul was con stantly disturbed at the thoughts of what he had done till his very bowels being torn to pieces by the intolerable grief he was under he threw up a great quantity of blood And as one of those servants that attended him carried out that blood he  by some supernatural providence slipped and fell down in the very place where Antigonus had been slain  and so he spilt some of the murderer s blood upon the spots of the blood of him that had been murdered which still appeared Hereupon a lamentable cry arose airiohg the spectators as if the servant had spilled the blood on purpose in that place  and as the king heard that cry he inquired what Was the cause of it  and while no body durst leli him he pressed them so much the more to let him know what was the matter so at length when he had threatened them and forced them to sjjeak out they told  whereupon he burst into tears and groaned and said  So I perceive 1 am noi  like to escape thf all seeing eye of God as to the great crimes     I have Chap IV WARS OF THE Jfiws 259  I have committed  bat the vengeance of the blood of my kins  man pursues me hastily O thon most impudent body  how  long xvilt thoa retaia a soul that ought to die 0 1 account of that   punishment it ought to suffer for a mother and a brother slain   how long shall I myself spend my blood drop by drop  let  them take it all at once  and let their ghosts no longer be dis  appointed by a few parcels of my bowels offered to them As soon as he had said these words he presently died when he had reigned no longer than a year CHAP IV What actions Mere done by Alexander jf nneuS who reigned â â twenty seven years Â 1 AND now the king s wife loosed the king s brethren â j and made Alexander king who appeared both elder i i age and more moderate iu his temper than the rest who when he came to the government slew one of his brethren as affecting to govern himself but had tl e other of them in great esteem as loving a quiet life without meddling with public af fairs 2 Now it happened that there was a battle between him and Ptolemy who was called Lathyrus who had taken the city Aso chis He indeed slew a great many of his enemies but the vie tory rather inclined to Ptolemy But when this Ptolemy was pursued by his mother Cleopatra and retired into Egypt Alex ander besieged Gadara and took it as also he did Amathus which was the strongest of all the fortresses that were about Jordan and therein were the most precious of all the posses sions of Theodorus the sou of Zeno Whereupon Theodoras marched against him and took what belonged to himself as well as the king s baggage and slew ten thousand of the Tews However Alexander recovered this blow and turned his force towards the maritime parts and took Raphia and Gaza with Anthedon also which was afterwards called Agrippias by king Herod 3 But when he had made slaves of the citizens of all these ci ties the nation of the Jews made an insurrection against him at a festival for at those feasts seditions are generally begun and it looked as if he should not be able to escape the plot they had laid for him had not his foreign auxiliaries the Pisidians and Cici lians assisted him for as to the Syrians he never admitted them among his mercenary troops on account of their innate enmity against the Jewish nation And when he had slain more than six thousand of the rebels he made an incursion into Arabia and ivhen he had taken that country together with the Gileadites K k a and WARS OF THE JEWS Book I and Moabites he enjoined them to pay him tribute and return ed to Amathus and as Theodorus was surprised at his great success he took the fortress and demolished it 4 However when he fought with Obodus king of the Ara bians who had laid an ambush for him near Golan and a plot against him he lost his entire army which was crowded together in a deep valley and broken to pieces by the multitudes of camels And when he had made his escape to Jerusalem he provoked the multitude which hated him before to make an insurrection against him and this on account of the greatness of the calamity that he was under However he was then too hard for them and in the several battles that were fought on both sides he slew not fewer than fifty thousand of the Jews in the interval of six years Yet had he no reason to rejoice in these victories since he did but consume his own kingdom  till at length he fell off fighting and endeavoured to come to a composition with them by talking with his subjects But this mutability and irregula rity of his conduct made them hate him still more And when he asked them why they so hated him  and what he should do in order to appease them  they said by killing himself for that it would be then all they could do to be reconciled to him who had done such tragical things to them even when he was dead At the same time they invited Demetrius who was call ed Eucerus to assist them and as he readily complied with their requests in hopes of great advantages and came with his ar my the Jews joined with those their auxiliaries about Shechem 5 Yet did Alexander meet with these forces with one thousand horsemen and eight thousand mercenaries that were on foot He had also with him that part of the Jews which favoured him to the number of ten thousand while the adverse party had three thousand horsemen and fourteen thousand footmen Now before they joined battle the kings made proclamation and endeavour ed to draw off each other s soldiers and make them revolt t while Demetrius hoped to induce Alexander s mercenaries to leave him and Alexander hoped to induce the Jews that were with Demetrius to leave him  But since neither the Jews would leave off their rage nor the Greeks prove unfaithful they came to an engagement and to a close fight with their weapons In which battle Demetrius was the conqueror although Alexan der s mercenaries shewed the greatest exploits both in soul and body Yet did the upshot of this battle prove different from what was expected as to both of them  for neither did those that invited Demetrius to come to them continue firm to him though he were conqueror  and six thousand Jews out of pity to the change of Alexander s condition when he was fled to Chap IV WARS OF THE JEWS 261 the mountains came over to him Yet could not Demetrius bear this turn of affairs but supposing that Alexander was al ready become a match for him again and that all the nation would at length run to him he left the country and went his way 6 However the rest of the Jewish multitude did not lay aside their quarrels with him when the foreign auxiliaries were gone  but they had a perpetual war with Alexander until he had slain the greatest part of them and driven the rest into the city Bemeselis and when he had demolished that city he carried the captives to Jerusalem Nay his rage was grown so extra vagant that his barbarity proceeded to the degree of impiety  for when he had ordered eight hundred to be hung upon crosses in the midst of the city he had the throats of their wives and children cut before their eyes  and these executions he saw as he was drinking and lying down with his concubines Upon which so deep a surprise seized on the people that eight thousand of his opposers fled away the very next night out of all Judea whose flight was only terminated by Alexander s death so at last though not till late and with great difficulty he by such actions procured quiet to his kingdom and left off fighting any more 7 Yet did that Antiochus who was also called Dionysus be come an forigin of troubles again This man was the brother of Demetrius and the last of the race of the Seleucidae Alex ander was afraid of him when he was marching against the Ara bians  so he cut a deep trench between Antipatris which was near the mountains and the shores of Joppa  he also erected an high wall before the trench and built wooden towers in order to hinder any sudden approaches But still he vas not able to exclude Antiochus for he burnt the towers and filled up the trenches and marched on with his army And as he looked upon taking his revenge on Alexander for endeavouring to stop him as a thing of less consequence he marched directly against the A rabians whose king retired into such parts of the country as were fittest for engaging the enemy and then on the sudden made his horse turn back which were in number ten thousand and fell upon Antiochus s army while they were in disorder and a ter rible battle ensued Antiochus s troops so long as he was alive fought it out although a mighty slaughter was made among them by the Arabians but when he fell for he was in the fore front in the utmost danger in rallying his troops they all gave ground and Â Joseplius here calls this Antiochus the last of the Seleutidae although thera remained still a shadow of another king of that family Antiochus Asiaticus or Commagenus who reigned or rather lay hid till Pompejr juite turned him out as Dean Aldrich here notes from Apphn and Jihtin 262 Book r WARS OF THE JEWS and the greatest part of his army were destroyed either in tjte action or the flight and for the rest who fled to the village of Cana it happened that they were all consumed by want of ne cessaries a few only excepted   8 About this time it was that the people of Damascus out of their hatred to Ptolemy the son of Menneus invited Aretas to take the government and made him king of Ceiesyria This man also made an expedition against Judea and beat Alexander in battle  but afterwards retired by mutual agreement But Alexander when he had taken Pella marched to Gerasa again out of the covetous desire he had of Theodorus s possessions  and when he had built a triple wall about the garrison he took the place by force He also demolished Golan and Seleucia and what was called The trolley of Antiochus  besides which he took the strong fortress of Gamala and stripped Demetrius who was governor therein of what he had on account of the many crimes laid to his charge and then returned into Judea after he had been three whole years in this expedition And now he was kindly received of the nation because of the good success he had So when he was at rest from war he fell into a distemper  for he was arBicted with a quartan ague and sup posed that byexercising himself again in martial affairs he should get rid of this distemper  but by making such expeditions at unseasonable times and forcing his body to undergo greater hardships than it was able to bear he brought himself to his end He died therefore in the midst of his troubles after ho had reigned seven and twenty years  CHAP V Alexandra reigns nine years during which time the Pharisees vecre the real rulers of the nation Â 1 VTOW Alexander left the kingdom to Alexandra his wife and dependedupon it that the Jews would nowvery rea dily submit to her  because she had been very averse to such cruelty as he had treated them with and had opposed his viola tion of their laws and had thereby got the good will of the people Nor was he mistaken as to his expectations for this woman kept the dominion by the opinion that the people had of her piety  for she chiefly studied the ancient customs of her country and cast those men out of the government that offended v against their holy laws And as she had two sons by Alexan der she made Hyrcanus the elder high priest on account of his age as also besides that on account of his inactive temper no way disposing him to disturb the public But she retained the younger Chap V WARS OF THE 3EWSi 203 younger Aristobulus with her as a private person by reason of the warmth of his temper 2 And now the Pharisees joined themselves to her to assist her in the government These are a certain sect of the Jews that appear more religious than others and seem to interpret the laws more accurately Now Alexandra hearkened to them to an extraordinary degree as being herself a woman of great piety towards God But these Pharisees artfully insinuated them selves into her favour by little and little and became themselves the real administrators of the public affairs they banished and reduced whom they pleased  they bound and loosed men at their pleasure  f and to say all at once they had the enjoy ment of the ro al authority whilst the expences and the difficul ties of it belonged to Alexandra She was a sagacious woman in the management of great affairs and intent always upon gather ing soldiers together  so that she increased the army the one half and procured a great body of foreign troops till her own nation became not only very powerful at home but terrible also to foreign potentates while she governed other people and the Pharisees governed her 3 Accordingly they themselves slew Diogenes a person of figure and one that had been a friend to Alexander  and accused him as having assisted the king with his advice for crucifying the eight hundred men before mentioned They also pre vailed with Alexandra to put to death the rest of those who had irritated him against them Now she was so superstitious as to comply with their desires and accordingly they slew whom they pleased themselves  but the principal of those that were in danger fled to Aristobulus who persuaded his mother to spare the men on account of their dignity but to expel them out of the city unless she took them to be innocent  so they were suffered to go unpunished and were dispersed all over the coun try But when Alexandra sent out her army to Damascus under pretence that Ptolemy was always oppressing that city she got possession of it  nor did it make any considerable re sistance She also prevailed with Tigranes king of Armenia who lay with his troops about Ptolemais and besieged J Cleopa tra  Matt xvi 19 xviii 18 f Here we have the oldest and most authentic Jewish exposition of binding and loosing for punishing or absolving men not for declaring actions lawful or unlawful as some more modern Jews and Christians vainly pretend  Strabo B XVI p 740 relates that this Selene Cleopatra was besieged by Tigranes not in Ptolemais as here but after she had left Syria in Seleucia a citadel in Mesopotamia and adds that when he had kept her a while in prison he put her to death Dean Aldrich supposes here that Strabo contradicts Jose phus which does not appear to me  for although josephus says both here and in the Antiquities B XIII ch xvi sect 4 that Tigranes besieged her now in Ptole 264 WARS OF THE JEWS Book I tra by agreements and presents to go away Accordingly Ti granes soon arose from the siege by reason of those domestic tu mults which happened upon Lucullus s expedition into Armenia 4 In the mean time Alexandra fell sick and Aristobulus her younger son took hold of this opportunity with his domestics of which he had a great many who were all of them his friends on account of the warmth of their youth and got possession of all the fortresses He also used the sums of money he found in them to get together a number of mercenary soldiers and made himself king  and besides this upon Hyrcanus s complaint to his mother she compassionated his case and put Aristobulus s wife and sons under restraint in Antonia which was a fortress that joined to the north part of the temple It was as I have already said of old called the Citadel but afterwards got the name of Antonia when Antony was lord of the East just as the other cities Sebaste and Agrippias had their names changed and these given them from Sebastus and Agrippa But Alex andra died before she could punish Aristobulus for his disinherit ing his brother after she had reigned nine years CHAP VI When Hyramus who was Alexander s heir receded from his claim of the crown Aristobulus is made king and afterward the same Hyrcanus by the means of Antipater is brought back by Are tas At last Pompey is made the arbitrator of the dispute be tween the brothers j 1 VTOW Hyrcanus was heir to the kingdom and to him did  his mother commit it before she died  but Aristobulus was superior to him in power and magnanimity  and when there was a battle between them to decide the dispute about the king dom near Jericho the greatest part deserted Hyrcanus and went over to Aristobulus but Hyrcanus with those of his party who staid with him fled to Antonia and got into his power the hos tages that might be for his preservation which were Aristobu lus s wife with her children  but they came to an agreement before things should come to extremities that Aristobulus should be king and Hyrcanus should resign that up but retain all the rest of his dignities as being the king s brother Hereupon they were reconciled to each other in the temple and embraced one another in a very kind manner while the people stood round about them they also changed their houses while Aristobulus went mais and that he took the city the Antiquities inform us yet does he no where intimate that he now took the queen herself so that both the narrations of Stra bo and Josephus may still be true notwithstanding Chap VI WARS OF THE JEWS 265 went to the royal palace and Hyrcanus retired to the house of Aristobulus 2 Now those other people which were at variance with Ari stobulus were afraid upon his unexpected obtaining the govern ment  and especially this concerned  Antipater whpm Aristo bulus hated of old He was by birth an Idumean and one of the principal of that nation on account of his ancestors and riches and other authority to him belonging  he also persuaded Hyr canus to fly to Aretas the king of Arabia and to lay claim to the kingdom  as also he persuaded Aretas to receive Hyrcanus and to bring him back to his kingdom  he also cast great re proaches upon Aristobulus as to his morals and gave great com mendations to Hyrcanus and exhorted Aretas to receive him and told him how becoming a thing it would be for him who ruled so great a kingdom to afford his assistance to such as are injured  alleging that Hyrcanus was treated unjustly by being deprived of that dominon which belonged to him by the prero gative of his birth And when he had predisposed them both to do what he would have them he took Hyrcanus by night and ran awayfrom the city and continuing his flight with great swiftness he escaped to the place called Petra which is the royal seat of the king of Arabia where he put Hyrcanus into Aretas s hand  and by discoursing much with him and gaining upon him with many presents he prevailed with him to give him an army that might restore him to his kingdom This army consisted of fifty thousand footmen and horsemen against which Aristobulus was not able to make resistance but was de serted in his first onset and was driven to Jerusalem  he also had been taken at first by force if Scaurus the Roman general had not come and seasonably interposed himself and raised the siege This Scaurus was sent into Syria from Armenia by Pompey the Great when he fought against Tigranes  so Scaurus came to Damascus which had been lately taken by Metellus and Lollius and caused them to leave the place  and upon his hearing how the affairs of Judea stood he made haste thither as to a certain booty 3 As soon therefore as he was come into the country there came ambassadors from both the brothers each of them desiring his assistance  but Aristobulus s three hundred talents had more weight with him than the justice of the cause  which sum when Scaurus had received he sent an herald to Hyrcanus and the Arabians and threatened them with the resentment of the Romans and of Pompey unless they would raise the siege So VOL Hit v LI  J   Aretas  That this Antipater the father of Herod the Great was an Idumean as Jo SNepJius affirms here see the note on Amiq B XIV ch xv sect z 266 WARS OF THE JEWS Book I Aretas was terrified and retired out of Judea to Philadelphia as did Scaurus return to Damascus again  nor was Aristobulus satisfied with escaping out of his brother s hands but gather td all his forces together and pursued his enemies and fought them at a place called Papyron and slew above six thousand of them and together with them Antipater s brother Phalion 4 When Hyrcanus and Antipater were thus deprived of their hopes from the Arabians  they transferred the same to their adversaries  and because Pompey had passed through Syria and was come to Damascus they fled to him for assistance  and  without any bribes they made the same equitable pleas that they had used to Aretas and besought him to hate the violent be haviour of Aristobulus and to bestow the kingdom upon him to whom it justly belonged both on account of his good character and on account of his superiority in age However neither was Aristobulus wanting to himself in this case as relying on the bribes that Scaurus had received  he was also there himself and adorned himself after a manner the most agreeable to royalty that he was able But he soon thought it beneath him to come in such a servile manner and could not endure to serve his own ends in a way so much more abject than he was used to  so he departed from Diospolis 5 At this his behaviour Pompey had great indignation  Hyr canus also and his friends made great intercession to Pompey  sd he took not only his Roman forces but many of his Syrian auxiliaries and marched against Aristobulus But when he had passed by Pella and Scythopolis and was come to Corea where you enter into the country of Judea when you go up to it through the Mediterranean parts he heard that Aristobulus was fled to Alexandrum which is a strong hold fortified with the utmost magnificence and situated upon an high mountain and he seiat to him and commanded him to come down Now his inclination was to try his fortune in a battle since he was called in such an imperious manner rather than to comply with that call However he saw the multitude were in great fear and his friends exhorted him to consider what the power of the Romans was and how it was irresistible  so he complied with their advice and came down to Pompey  and when he had made that the 1 offered sect 6  although his remarkable abstinence from the 2000 talents that were in the Jewish temple when he took it a little afterward ch vii sect 6 and Antiq B XIV ch iv sect 4 will hatdly permit us to desert the Greek cepits all which agree that hÂ did not take them Chap VI WARS or THE JEWS 267 a long apology for himself and for the justness of his cause in taking the government he returned to the fortress And when his brother invited him again to plead his cause he came down and spake about the justice of it and then went away without any hindrance from Pompey  so he was between hope and fear And when he came down it was to prevail with Pompey to allow him the government entirely  and when he went up to the citadel it was that he might not appear to debase himself 4oo low However Pompey commanded him to give up his fortified places and forced him to write to every one of their governors to yield them up  they having had this charge given them to obey no letters but what were of his own hand writing Accordingly he did what he was ordered to do  but had still an indignation in what was done and retired to Jerusalem and pre pared to fight with Pompey 6 But Pompey did not give him time to make any prepara tions for a siege but followed him at his heels  he was also obliged to make haste in his attempt by the death of Mithri dates of which he was informed about Jericho Now here is the most fruitful country of Judea which bears a vast number of palm trees besides the balsam tree whose sprouts they cut with sharp stones and at the incisions they gather the juice which drops down like tears So Pompey pitched his camp in that place one night and then hasted away the next morning to Jeru salem  but Aristobulus was so affrighted at his approach that he came and met him by way of supplication He also promised him money and that he would deliver up both himself and the city into his disposal and thereby mitigated the anger of Pompey Yet did not he perform any of the conditions he had agreed to  for Aristobulus s party would not so much as admit Gabinius into the city who was sent to receive the money that he had promised CHAP VII How Pompey iad the city Jerusalem delivered up to Jnm lut took the temple byforce Hoiv be vent into the Holy of Holies  as a so what were his other exploits in Judea 5 1 A T this treatment Pompey was very angry and took  Aristobulus into custody And when he was come to the city he looked about where he might make his attack  for he saw the walls were so firm that it would be hard to overcome them and that the valley before the walls was terrible  and that L 1 2 the  Of the famous palm trees and balsam about Jericho and Engaddi seethe notes in Havercamp s edition both here and B 11 ch U sect i The are some what too long to be transcribed in this place WARS OF THE JEWS Book I the temple which was within that valley was itself encompas sed with a very strong wall insomuch that if the city were taken the temple would be a second place of refuge for the ene my to retire to   2 Now as he was long in deliberating about this matter a sedition arose among the people within the city  Aristobulus s party being willing to fight and to set their king at liberty while the party of Hyrcanus were for opening the gates to Pom pey  and the dread people were in occasioned these last to be a very numerous party when they looked upon the excellent order the Roman soldiers were in So Aristobulus s party was worsted and retired into the temple and cut off the communi cation between the temple and the city by breaking down the bridge that joined them together and prepared to make an op position to the utmost but as the others had received the Ro mans into the city and had delivered up the palace to him Pom pey sent Piso one of his great officers into that palace with an army who distributed a garrison about the city because he could not persuade any one of those that had fled to the temple to come to terms of accommodation  he then disposed all things that were round about them so as might favour their attacks as having Hyrcanus s party very ready to afford them both counsel and assistance 3 But Pompey himself filled up the ditch that was on the north side of the temple and the entire valley also the army it self being obliged to carry the materials for that purpose And indeed it was an hard thing to fill up that valley by reason of its immense depth especially as the Jews used all the means pos sible to repel them from their superior station  nor had the Ro mans succeeded in their endeavours had not Pompey taken no tice of the seventh days on which the Jews abstain from all sorts of work on a religious account and raised his bank but restrain ed his soldiers from fighting on those days for the Jews only acted defensively on Sabbath days But as soon as Pompey had filled up the valley he erected high towers upon the bank and brought those engines which they had fetched from Tyre near to the wall and tried to batter it down  and the slingers of stones beat ofFthose that stood above them and drove them away  but the towers on this side of the city made very great resistance and were indeed extraordinary both for largeness and magnificence 4 Now here it was that upon the many hardships which the Romans underwent Pompey could not but admire not only at the other instances of the Jews fortitude but especially that they did not at all intermit their religious services even when they were encompassed with darts on all sides  for as if the city were Chap VII   WARS OF THE JEWS 269 in full peace their daily sacrifices and purifications and every branch of their religious worship was still performed to God with the utmost exactness Nor indeed when the temple was actually taken and they were every day slain about the altar did they leave off the instances of their divine worship that were appointed by their law  for it was in the third month of the siege before the Romans could even with great difficulty overthrow one of the towers and get into the temple Now he that first df all ventured to get over the wall was Faustus Cornelius the son of Sylla  and next after him were two centurians Furius and Fabius  and every one of these was followed by a cohort of his own who encompassed the Jews on all sides and slew them some of them as they were running for shelter to the tem ple and others as they for a while fought in their own defence 5 And now did many of the priests even when they saw their enemies assailing them with swords in their hands without any disturbance go on with their divine worship and were slain while they were offering their drink offerings and burning their in cense as preferring the duties about their worship to God before their own preservation The greatest part of them were slain by their own countrymen of the adverse faction and an innumerable multitude threw themselves down precipices  nay some there were who were so distracted among the insuperable difficulties they were under that they set fire to the buildings that were near to the wall and were burnt together with them Now of the Jews were slain twelve thousand  but of the Romans very few were slain but a greater number was wounded 6 But there was nothing that affected the nation so much in the calamities they were then under as that their holy place which had been hitherto seen by none should be laid open to strangers  for  Pompey and those that were about him went into the temple itself whether it was not lawful for any to enter but the high priest and saw what was reposited therein the can dlestick with its lamps and the table and the pouring vessels and the censers all made entierly of gold as also a great quanti ty of spices heaped together with two thousand talents of sacred money Yet did not he touch that money nor any thing else that was there reposited  but he commanded the ministers about the temple the very next day after he had taken it to cleanse it and to perform their accustomed sacrifices Moreover he made Hyr canus high priest as one that not only in other respects had shewed great alacrity on his side during the siege but as he had been  Thus says Tacitus Cn Pompeius first of all subdued the Jews and went in to their temple by right of conquest Hist B V ch ix nor did he touch any of its riches as has been observed on the parallel place of the Antiquities B XIV ch iv sect 4 out of Cicero himself 2TO WARS OF THE JEWS  Book I been the means of hindering the multitude that was in the coun try from fighting for Aristobulus which they were otherwise very ready to have done  by which means he acted the part of a good general and reconciled the people to him more by bene volence than by terror Now among the captives Aristobulus s father in law was taken who was also his uncle  so those that were the moft guilty he punished with decollation  but reward ed Faustus and those with him that had fought so bravely with glorious presents and laid a tribute upon the country and upon Jerusalem itself 7 He also took away from the nation all those cities they had formerly taken and that belonged to Celesyria and made them subject to him that was at that time appointed to be the Roman president there and reduced Judea within its proper bounds He also rebuilt Gadara that had been demolished by the Jews in order to gratify one Demetrius who was of Gadara and was one of his own freed men He also made other cities free from their dominion that lay in the midst of the country such I mean as they had not demolished before that time Hippos and Scythopolis as also Pella and Samaria and Marissa  and be sides these Ashdod and Jamnia and Arethusa  and in like man ner dealt he with the maritime cities Gaza and Joppa and Do ra and thnt which was anciently called Strata1 Tower but was afterward rebuilt with the most magnificent edifices and had its name changed to Cesarta by king Herod All which he re stored to their own citizens and put them under the province of Syria  which province together with Judea and the countries as far as Egypt and Euphrates he committed to Scaurus as their governor and gave him two legions to support him  while he made all the haste he could himself to go through Celicia in his way to Rome having Aristobulus and his children along with him as his captives They were two daughters and two sons  the one of which sons Alexander ran away as he was going  but the younger Antigonus with his sisters were carried to Rome CHAP VIII Alexander the son of Aristobulus who ran away from Pompey makes an expedition against Hyrcanus â but being overcome by Gabinius be

even there he was under great hardship  for his army was afflicted with famine In order to supply which want Hyrcanus afforded him some assistance and sent him provisions by the means of Antipater whom also Scaurus sent to Aretas as one well acquainted with him to induce him to pay him mo ney to buy his peace The king of Arabia  complied with the proposal and gave him three hundred talents  upon which Scaurus drew his army out of Arabia 2 But as for Alexander that son of Aristobulus who ran a way from Pompey in some time he got a considerable band of men together and lay heavy upon Hyrcanus and over ran Judea and was likely to overturn him quickly  and indeed he had come to Jerusalem and had ventured to rebuild its wall that was thrown down by Pompey had not Gabinius who was sent as successor to Scaurus into Syria shewed his bravery as in many other points so in making an expedition against Alexan der  who as he was afraid that he would attack him so he got together a large army composed of ten thousand armed foot men and fifteen hundred horsemen He also built walls about proper places Alexandrium and Hyrcanium and Macherus that lay upon the mountains of Arabia 3 However Gabinius sent before him Marcus Antonius and followed himself with his whole army  but for the select body of soldiers that were about Antipater and another body of Jews under the command of Malithus and Pitholaus these joined themselves to those captains that were about Marcus Antonius and met Alexander  to which body came Gabinius with his main army soon afterward  and as Alexander was not able to sustain the charge of the enemies forces now they were joined he retired But when he was come near to Jerusalem he was forced to fight and lost six thousand men in the battle  three thousand of which fell down dead and three thousand were taken alive  so he fled with the remainder to Alexandrium 4 Now when Gabinius was come to Alexandrium because he found a great many there encamped he tried by promising them pardon for their former offences to induce them to come over to him before it came to a fight but when they would hearken to no terms of accommodation he slew a great number of them  Take the like attestation to the truth of this submission of Aretas king of Arabia to Scaurus the Roman general in the words of Dean Aldnch  Hence  says he is derived that old and famous Denarius belonging tothg Emilian fa  mily represented in Havercamp s edition wherein Aietas appears in a pos  tare of supplication and taking hold of a camel s bridle with his left hand and  with his right hand presenting a branch of the frankincense tree with this m  scription M SCAURUS EX t C and beneath REX ARETAS 272 WARS OF THE JEWS Book I them and shut up a great number of them in the citadel Now Marcus Antonius their leader signalised himself in this battle who as he always shewed great courage so did he never shew it so much as now  but Gabinius leaving forces to take the cita del went away himself and settled the cities that had not been demolished and rebuilt those that had been destroyed Accord ingly upon his injunctions the following cities were restored Scythopolis and Samaria and Anthedon and Appolinia and Ja minia and Raphia and Marissa and Adoreus and Gamala and Ashdod and many others while a great number of men readily ran to each of them and became their inhabitants 5 When Gabinius had taken care of these cities he returned to Alexandrium and pressed on the siege So when Alexander despaired of ever obtaining the government he sent ambassadors to him and prayed him to forgive what he had offended him in and gave up to him the remaining fortresses Hyrcaniutn and Macheras as he put Alexandrium into his hands afterwards  all which Gabinius demolished atthe persuasion of Alexander s mo ther that they might not be receptacles of men in a second war She was now there in order to mollify Gabinius out of her con cern for her relations that were captives at Rome which were her husband and her other children After this Gabinius brought Hyrcanus to Jerusalem and committed the care of the temple to him  but ordained the other political government to be by an aristocracy He also parted the whole nation into five conven tions assigning one portion to Jerusalem another to Gadara that another should belong to Amathus a fourth to Jericho and to the fifth division was allotted Sepphoris a city of Galilee So the people were glad to be thus freed from monarchical govern ment and were governed for the future by an aristocracy 6 Yet did Aristobulus afford another foundation for new disturbances He fled away from Rome and got together again many of the Jews that were desirous of a change such as had borne an affection to him of old  and when he had taken Alex andrium in the first place he attempted to build a wall about it but as soon as Gabinius had sent an army against him under Si senna and Antonius and Servilius he was aware of it and re treated to Macherus And as for the unprofitable multitude he dismissed them and only marched on with those that were arm ed being to the number of eight thousand among whom was Pi tholaus who had been the lieutenant at Jerusalem but deserted to Aristobulus with a thousand of his men  so the Romans fol Jowed him and when it came to a battle Aristobulus s party for a long time fought courageously but at length they were over borne by the Romans and of them five thousand fell down dead and Chap VIII WARS OF THE JEWS 273 and about two thousand fled to a certain little hill but the thou sand that remained with Aristobulus brake through the Roman army and marched together to Macherus and when the king had lodged the first night upon its ruins he was in hopes of rai sing another army if the war would but cease a while  accor dingly he fortified that strong hold though it were ilone after a poor manner But the Romans falling upon him he resisted even beyond his abilities for two days and then was taken and brought a prisoner to Gabinius with Antigonus his son who had fled away together with him from Rome and from Gabinus he was carried to Rome again Wherefore the senate put him under confinement but returned his children back to Judea be cause Gabinius informed them by letters that he had promised Aristobulus s mother to do so for her delivering the fortresses up to him 1 But now as Gabinius was marching to the war against the Farthians he was hindered by Ptolemy whom upon his return from Euphrates he brought back into Egypt making use of Hyrcanus and Antipatcr to provide every thing that was neces sary for this expedition  for Antipater furnished him with mo ney and weapons and corn and auxiliaries  he also prevailed with the Jews that were there and guarded the avenues at Pe lusium to let them pass But now upon Gabinius s absence the other part of Syria was in motion and Alexander the son of Aristobulus brought the Jews to revolt again Accordingly he got together a very great army and set about killing all the Ro mans that were in the country  hereupon Gabinius was afraid for he was come back already out of Egypt and obliged to come back quickly by these tumults and sent Antipater who prevailed with some of the revoltersto be quiet However thir ty thousand still continued with Alexander who was himself eager to fight also  accordingly Gabinius went out to fight when the Jews met him and as the battle was fought near Mount Ta bor ten thousand of them were slain and the rest of the multi tude dispersed themselves and fled away So Gabinius came to Jerusalem and settled the government as Antipater would have it  thence he marched and fought and beat the Nabateans  as for Mithridates and Orsanes who fled out of Parthia he sent them away privately but gave it out among the soldiers that they had run away 8 In the mean time Crassus came as successor to Gabinius in Syria He took away all the rest of the gold belonging to the temple of Jerusalem in order to furnish himself for his expedi tion against the Parthians He also took away the two thousand talents which Pompey had not touched  but when he had passed VOL III M m over 274 WARS OF THE JEWS Book I over Euphrates he perished himself and his army with him  concerning which affairs this is not a proper time to speak more largely y But now Cassius after Crassus put a stop to the Parthians who were marching in order to enter Syria Cassius had fled in to that province and when he had taken possession of the same he made an hasty march into Judea  and upon his taking Ta richeae he carried thirty thousand Jews into slavery He also slew Pitholaus who had supported the seditious followers of A ristobulus and it was Antipater who advised him 50 to do Now this Antipater married a wife of an eminent family among the Arabians whose name was Cypros and had four sons born to him by her Phasaelus and Herod who was afterwards king and besides these Joseph and Pheroras  and he had a daughter whose name was Salome Now as he made himself friends among the men of power every where by the kind offices he did them and the hospitable manner that he treated them  so did he contract the greatest friendship with the king of Arabia by marrying his relation  insomuch that when he made war with Aristobulus he sent and intrusted his children with him So when Cassius had forced Alexander to come to terms and to be quiet he return ed to Euphrates in order to prevent the Parthians from repass ing it concerning which matter  we shall speak elsewhere CHAP IX Aristobulus is taken off by Pompey1 friends as is Ms son Alexan dert 1y Scipio Antipater cultivates a friendship with Cxsar after Pompey s death  he also performs great actions in that war wherein he assisted Mithridates Â 1 VT OW upon the flight of Pompey and of the senate be â yorid the Ionian Sea Caesar got Rome and the empire under his power and released Aristobulus from his bonds He also committed two legions to him and sent him in haste into Syria as hoping that by his means he should easily conquer that country and the parts adjoining to Judea But envy prevented any effect of Aristobulus s alacrity and the hopes of Caesar  for he was taken off by poison given him by those of Pompey s par ty and for a long while he had not so much as a burial vouch safed him in his own country  but his dead body lay aboxe ground preserved in honey until it was sent to the Jews by Antony in order to be buried in the royal sepulchres 2 His son Alexander also was beheaded by Scipio at Antioch and that by the command of Pompey and upon an accusation laid Â This citation is now wanting Chap IX WARS OF THE EWSi 5275 laid against him before his tribunal for the mischiefs he had done to the Romans But Ptolemy the son of Menneus who was then ruler of Chaleis under Libanus took his brethren to him by sending his son Philippic for them to Ascalon who took Antigonus as well as his sisters away from Aristobulus s wife and brought them to his father and falling in love with the younger daughter he married her and was afterward slain by his father on her account for Ptolemy himself after he had slain his son married her whose name was Alexandra  on ac count of which marriage he took the greater care of her brother and sister 3 Now after Pompey was dead Antipater changed sides and cultivated a friendship with Caesar And since Mithridates of Pergamus with the forces he led against Egypt was excluded from the avenues about Pelusium and was forced to stay at As calon he persuaded the Arabians among whom he had lived to assist him and came himself to him at the head of three thousand armed men He also encouraged the men of power in Syria to come to his assistance as also of the inhabitants of Libanus Pto lemy and Jamblicus and another Ptolemy by which means the cities of that country came readily into this war insomuch that Mithridates ventured now iri dependence upon the additional strength that he had gotten by Antipater to march forward to Pelusium  ahd when they refused him a passage through it he besieged the city in the attack of which place Antipater prin cipally signalized himself for he brought down that part of the wall which was over against him and leaped first Of all into the city with the men that were about him 4 Thus was Pelusium taken But still as they were march ing on those Egyptian Jews that inhabited the country called the country of Chiias stopped them Then did Antipater not only pesuade them not to stop them but to afford provisions for their army  on which account even the people about Memphis would not fight against them but of their Own accord joined Mithridates Whereupon he went round about Delta and fought the rest of the Egyptians At a place called the Jews Camp  nay when he Was in danger in the battle with all his right wing Antipater wheeled about and came along the bank of the river to him  for he had beaten those that opposed him as he led the left wing After which success he fell upon those that pursued Mithridates and slew a great many of them and pursued the remainder so far that he took their camp while he lost no more than fourscore of his own men as Mithridates lost during the pursuit that was made after him about eight hundred He was also himself saved unexpectedly and became M m2 an WARS OF THE JEWS Book I dn iinreproachable witness to Caesar of the great actions of Antrpater 5 Whereupon Citsar encouraged Antipater to undertake other hazardous enterprises for him and that by giving him great commendations and hopes of reward In all which en terprises he readily exposed himself to many dangers and be came a most courageous warrior  and had many wounds almost all over his body as demonstrations of his valour And when Co sar had settled the affairs of Egypt and returning into Syria again he gave him the privilege of a Roman citizen and free dom from taxes and rendered him an object of admiration by the honours and marks of friendship he bestowed upon him On this account it was that he also confirmed Hyrcanus in the high priesthood CHAP X Cxsar makes Antipattr procurator of Judta  as does Antipater appoint Phasael to be governor of Jerusalem and Herod gover nor of Galilee  who in same time was called to answer for himself before the Sanhedrim t where he is acquitted Sextus Cifsar is treacherously tilled by Bassus and is succeeded by Marcus j 1 A BOUT this time it was that Antigonus the son of Aris â â tobulus came to Caesar and became in a surprising manner the occasion of Antipater s farther advancement for whereas he ought to have lamented that his father appeared to have been poisoned on account of his quarrels with Pompey and to have complained of Scipio s barbarity towards his brother and not to mix any invidious passion when he was suing for mercy  besides those things he came before Coesar and accused Hyrca nus and Antipater how they had driven him and his brethren en tirely out of their native country and had acted in a great many instances unjustly and extravagantly with relation to their nation and that as to the assistance they had sent him into Egypt it was not done out of good will to him but out of the fear they were in from former quarrels and in order to gain pardon for their friendship to his enemy Pompey 2 Hereupon Antipater threw away his garments and shewed the multitude of the wounds he had and said that  as to his  good will to Caesar he had no occasion to say a word because Â his body cried aloud though he said nothing himself  that he Â wondered at Antigonus s boldness while he was himself no  other than the son of an enemy to the Romans and of a fugi â tive and had it by inheritance from his father to be fond of  innovations Chap X WARS Ot THE JEWS 11 innovations and seditions that he should undertake t accuse  other men before the Roman governor and endeavour to gairi  some advantages to himself when he ought to be contented  that he was suffered to live  for that the reason of his desire  of governing public affairs was not so much because he was in  wantof it butbecause if he could once obtain the same he might  stir up a sedition among the Jews and use what they should gain  from the Romans to the disservice of those that gave it him 3 When Caesar heard this he declared Hyrcanus to be the most worthy of the high priesthood and gave leave to Antipater td choose what authority he pleased  but he left the determination of such dignity to him that bestowed the dignity upon him  so he was constituted procurator of all Judea and obtained leave moreover to rebuild  those walls of his country that had been thrown down These honorary grants Ccesar sent orders to have engraved in the capitol that they might stand there as in dications of his own justice and of the virtue of Antipater 4 But as soon as Antipater had conducted Caesar out of Sy ria he returned to Judea and the first thing he did was to re build that wall of his own country Jerusalem which Pompey had overthrown and then to go over the country and to quiet the tumults that were therein  where he partly threatened and partly advised every one and told them that  in case they  would submit to Hyrcanus they would live happily and  peaceably and enjoy what they possessed and that with uni  versal peace and quietness  but that in case they hearkened to  such as had some frigid hopes by raising new troubles to get  themselves some gain they should then find him to be their  lord instead of their procurator  and find Hyrcanus to be a  tyrant instead of a king  and both the Romans and Caesar to  be their enemies instead of rulers  for that they would not suf  fer him to be removed from the government whom they had  made their governor And at the same time that he said this he settled the affairs of the country by himself because lie saw that Hyrcanus was inactive and not fit to manage the af fairs of the kingdom So he constituted his eldest son Phasaelus governor of Jerusalem and of the parts about it he also sent his next son Herod who wasf very young with equal authori ty into Galilee 5 Now  What is here noted by Hudson and Spanheim that this grant of leave to rebuild the walls of the cities of Judea was made by Julius Cnrsar not as here to Antipater but to Hyrcanus Ajuiq B XIV ch viii sect 5 has hardly an t pearance of a contradiction Antipater being now perhaps considered only as Hyrcanus s deputy and minister although he afterwards made a cypher of Hyr canus and under great decency of behaviour to him took the real authority to himself f Or 25 years gf age See the nate on Antiq E I ch xii sect 3 and on B 278 WARS OF THE JEW9 Book I 5 Now Herod was an active man and soon found proper materials for his active spirit to work upon As therefore he found that Hezekias the head of the robbers ran over the neigh bouring parts of Syria with a great band of men he caught him and slew him and many more of the robbers with him  which exploit was chiefly grateful to the Syrians insomuch that hymns were sung in Herod s commendation both in the villages and in the cities as having procured their quietness and having pre served what they possessed to them  on which occasion he be came acquainted with Sextus Caesar a kinsman of the great Cae sar and president of Syria A just emulation of his glorious actions excited Phasaelus also to imitate him Accordingly he procured the good will of the inhabitants of Jerusalem by his own management of thecity aiFairs and did not abuse his power in any disagreeable manner  whence it came to pass that the nation paid Antipater the respects that were due only to a king and the honours they all yielded him were equal to the honours due to an absolute lord yet did he not abate any part of that good will or fidelity which he owed to Hyrcanus 6 However he found it impossible to escape envy in such his prosperity  for the glory of these young men affected even Hyrcanus himself already privately though he said nothing of it to any body  but what he principally was grieved at was the great actions of Herod and that so many messengers came one be fore another and informed him of the great reputation he got in all his undertakings There were also many people in the royal palace itself who inflamed his envy at him  those I mean who were obstructed in their designs by the prudence either of the young men or of Antipater These men said that by com mitting the public affairs to the management of Antipater and of his sons he sat down with nothing but the bare name of a king without any of its authority and they asked him how long he would so far mistake himself as to breed up kings against his own interest  for that they did not now conceal their government of affairs any longer but were plainly lords of the nation and had thrust him out of his authority  that this was the case when He rod slew so many men without his giving him any command to do it either by word of mouth or by his letter and this in con tradiction to the law of the Jews  who therefore in case he be not a king but a private man still ought to come to his trial and answer it to him and to the laws of his country which do not permit any one to be killed till he hath been condemned in judge ment 7 Now XIV ch ix sect i and Of the W r B II eh xi sect 6 and Polyb B XVII P 72 J  Chap X WARS OF THE JEWS 27a 7 Now Hyrcanus was by degrees inflamed with these dis courses and at length could bear no longer but he summoned Herod to take his trial Accordingly by his father s advice and as soon as the affairs of Galilee would give him leave he came up to Jerusalem when he had first placed garrisons in Galilee  however he came with a sufficient body of soldiers so many in deed that he might not appear to have with him an army able to overthrow Hyrcanus s government nor yet so few as to expose him to the insults of those that envied him However Sextus Caesar was in fear for the young man lest he should be taken by his enemies and brought to punishment so he sent some to denounce expressly to Hyrcanus that he should acquit Herod of the capital charge against him  who acquitted him according ly as being otherwise inclined also so to do for he loved Herod 8 But Herod supposing that he had escaped punishment with the consent of the king retired to Sextus to Damascus and got every thing ready in order not to obey him if he should summons him again  whereupon those that were evil disposed irritated Hyrcanus and told him that Herod was gone away in anger and was prepared to make war upon him  and as the king be lieved what they said he knew not what to do since he saw his antagonist was stronger than he was himself And now since Herod was made general of Celefyria and Samaria by Sextus Caesar he was formidable not only from the good will which the nation bore him but by the power he himself had  insomuch that Hyrcanus fell into the utmost degree of terror and expect ed he would presently march against them with his army 9 Nor was he mistaken in the conjecture he made for He rod got his army together out of the anger he bare him for his threatening him with the accusation in a public court and led it to Jerusalem in order to throw Hyrcanus down from his king dom  and this he had soon done unless his father and brother had gone out together and broken the force of his fury and this by exhorting him to carry his revenge no farther than to threat ening and affrighting but to spare the king under whom he had been advanced to such a degree of power  and that he ought not to be so much provoked at his being tried as to forget to be thankful that he was acquitted  nor so long to think upon what was of a melancholy nature as to be ungrateful for his deliver ance  and if we ought to reckon that God is the arbitrator of success in war an unjust cause is of more disadvantage than an army can be of advantage  and that therefore he ought not to be entirely confident of success in a case where he is to fight against his king his supporter and one that had often been his be nefactor and that had never been severe to him any otherwise than G80 WARS OF THE JEWS Book I than as he had hearkened to evil counsellors and this no farther than by bringing a shadow of injustice upon him So Herod was prevailed upon by these arguments and supposed that what he had already done was sufficient for his future hopes and that he had enough shewn his power to the nation 10 In the mean time there was a disturbance among the Ro mans about Apamia and a civil war occasioned by the treacher ous  slaughter of Sextus Caesar by Cicilius Bassus which he perpetrated out of his good will to Pompey  he also took the authority over his forces  but as the rest of Caesar s command ers attacked Bassus with their whole army in order to punish him for the murder of Caesar Antipater also sent them assistance by his sons both on account of him that was murdered and on account of that Caesar who was still alive both of which were their friends  and as this war grew to be of a considerable length Marcus came of Italy as successor to Sextus CHAP XI Herod it made procurator of all Syria  Malichus is afraid of him and takes Intipatcr off by poison  whereupon the tribunes of the soldiers are prevailed with to kill him  1  I HERE was at this time a mighty war raised among the Romans upon the sudden aud treacherous slaughter of Caesar by Cassius and Brutus after he had held the government for f three years and seven months Upon this murder there were very great agitations and the great men were mightily at difference one with another and every one betook himself to that party where they had the greatest hopes of their own of advan cing themselves Accordingly Cassius came into Syria in or der to receive the forces that were at Apamia where he procu red a reconciliation between Bassus and Marcus and the legions which were at difference with him  so he raised the siege of Apamia and took upon him the command of the army and went about exacting tribute of the cities and demanding their money to such a degree as they were not able to bear 2 So he gave command that the Jews should bring in seven hundred talents  whereupon Antipater out of his dread of Cas sius s threats parted the raising of this sum among his sons and among others of his acquaintance and to be done immediately  and  Many writers of the Roman history give an account of this murder of Sex tils Cxsar and of the war of Apamia upon that occasion They are cited in Dean Aldrich s note t In the Antiquities B XIV ch xi sect i the duration of the reign of Julius Cfesar is three years six months but here three years seven months beginning rightly says Desn Aldrich from his second dictatorship It is probable the real duration might be three years and between six and seven months Chap XI WARS OF THE JEWS 281 and among them he required one Malichus who was at enmity with him to do his part also which necessity forced him to do Now Herod in the first place mitigated the passion of Gassius by bringing his share out of Galilee which was an hundred ta lents on which account he was in the highest favour with him  and when he reproached the rest for being tardy he was angry at the cities themselves  so he made slaves of Gophna and Em maus and two others of less note  nay he proceeded as if he would kill Malichus because he had not made greater haste in exacting his tribute  but Antipater prevented the ruin of this man and of the other cities and got into  Cassius s favour by bringing in an hundred talents immediately 3 However when Cassius was gone Malichus forgot the kindness that Antipater had done him and laid frequent plots against him that had saved him as making haste to get him out of the way who was an obstacle to his wicked practices  but Antipater was so much afraid of the power and cunning of the man that he went beyond Jordan in order to get an army to guard himself against his treacherous designs  but when Mali chus was caught in his plot he put upon Antipater s sons by his impudence for he thoroughly deluded Phasaelus who was the guardian of Jerusalem and Herod who was intrusted with the weapons of war and this by a great many excuses and oaths and persuaded them to procure his reconciliation to his father Thus was he preserved again by Antipater who dissuaded Marcus the then president of Syria from his resolution of killing Mali chus on account of his attempts for innpyation 4 Upon the war between Cassius ancf Brutus on one side a gainst the younger Caesar Augustus and Antony on the other Cassius and Marcus got together an army out of Syria  and be cause Herod was likely to have a great share in providing neces saries they then made him procurator of all Syria and gave him an army of foot and horse Cassius promised him also that after the war was over he would make him king of Judea  but it so happened that tke power and hopes of his son became the cause of his perdition  for as Malichus was afraid of this he corrupt ed one of the king s cup bearers with money to give a poisoned potion to Antipater so he became a sacrifice to Malichus s wic kedness and died at a feast He was a man in other respects ac VOL III N n live  It appears evidently by Josephus s accounts both here and in his Antiquities B XIV ch xi sect i that this Cassius oneof Caesar s murderers was a bitter oppressor and exacter of tribute in judea these 700 talents amount to about L 300 000 Sterling and are about half the yearly revenues of king Herod after wards See the note on Antiq B XVII ch xi sect 4 It abo appears that Galilee then paid no more than 100 talents or the 7th part of the entire sum to be levied in all the cpuntry 262 WARS OF THE JEWS Book I live in the management of affairs and one that recovered the go vernment to Hyrcanus and preserved it in his hands 5 However Maliclms when he Was suspected of poisoning Antipater and when the multitude was angry with him for it de nied it and made the people believe he was not guilty He also prepared to make a greater figure and raised soldiers  for he did not suppose that Herod would be quiet who indeed came upon him with an army presently in order to revenge his father s death  but upon hearing the advice of his brother Phasaelus not to punish him in an open manner lest the multitude should fall into a sedition he admitted of Malichus s apology and pro i fessed that he cleared him of the suspicion  he also made a pom pous funeral for his father 6 So Herod went to Samaria which was then in a tumult and settled the city in peace after which at the Pentecost festival he returned to Jerusalem having his armed men with him  hereupon Hyrcanus at the request of Malichus who fear ed his reproach forbade them to introduce foreigners to mix themselves with the people of the country while they were pu rifying themselves  but Herod despised the pretence and him that gave that command and came in by night Upon which Malichus came to him and bewailed Antipater Herod also made him believe he admitted of his lamentations as real al though he had much ado to restrain his passion at him  however he did himself bewail the murder of his father in his letters to Cassius who on other accounts also hated Malichus  Cassius sent him word back thaÂ he should avenge his father s death upon him and privately gave order to the tribunes that were under him that they should assist Herod in a righteous action he was about T And because upon the taking of Laodicea by Cassius the men of power were gotten together from all quarters with pre sents and crowns in their hands Herod allotted this time for the punishment of Malichus When Malichus suspected that and was at Tyre he resolved to withdraw his son privately from a rr ong the Tynans who was an hostage there while he got ready to fly away into Judea  the despair he was in of escaping ex cited him to think of greater things  for he hoped that he should raise the nation to a revolt from the Romans while Cassius was busy about the war against Antony and that he should easily depose Hyrcanus and get the crown for himself  8 But fate laughed ct the hopes he had  for Herod foresaw what he vyassp icalqus about and invited both Hyrcanus and him to supper   but calling one of the principal servants that stood by him to him he sent him out as though it Xvere to get things rea dy for supper but in reality to give notice beforehand about the plot Chap XII WARS OF THE JEWS 283 plot that was laid against him  accordingly they called to mind what orders Cassius had given them and went out of the city with their swords in their hands upon the sea shore where they encompassed Malichus round about and killed him wiih many wounds Upon which Hyrcanus was immediately affrighted till he swooned away and fell down at the surprise he was in  and it was with difficulty that he was recovered when he asked xvho it was that had killed Malichus  and when one of the tribunes replied that it was done by the command of Cassias  Then  said he Cassius hath saved both me and my country by cutting  off one that was laying plots against them both Whether h e spake according to his own sentiments or whether ITS fear was such that he was obliged to commend the action by saying so is uncertain  however by this method Herod inflicted punish ment upon Malichus CHAP XII Pbasaelus is too iard for Felix  Herod also overcomes Antigomn in battle  and the Jews accuse both Herod and Phasaelus t but Antonius acquits them and makes them tetrarcis  1 1X HEN Cassius was gone out of Syria another sedition arose at Jerusalem wherein Felix assaulted Phasaelus with an army that he might revenge the death of Malichus up on Herod by falling upon his brother Now Herod happened then to be with Fabius the governor of Damascus and as he was going to his brother s assistance he was detained by sickness j m the mean time Phasaelus was by himself too hard for Felix and reproached Hyrcanus on account of his ingratitude both for what assistance he had afforded Malichus and for overlooking Mali chus s brother when he possessed himself of the fortresses for he had gotten a great many of them already and among them the strongest of them all Masada 2 However nothing could be sufficient for him against the force of Herod who as soon as he was recovered took the other fortresses again and drove him out of Masada in the pos ture of a supplicant he also drove away Marion the tyrant of the Tyrians out of Galilee when he had already possessed him self of three fortified places but as to those Tyrians whom he had caught he preserved them all alive  nay some of them he gave presents to and so sent them away and thereby procured good will to himself from the city and hatred to the tyrant Ma lion had indeed obtained that tyrannical power of Cassius who N n 2 set 284r  WARS OF THE JEWS Book I  set tyrants over all Syria  and out of hatred to Herod it was that he assisted Antigonus the son of Aristobulus and principal ly on Fabius s account whom Antigonus had made his assistant by money and had him accordingly on his side when he made his descent but it was Piolemy the kinsman of Antigonus that supplied all that he wanted 3 When Herod had fought against these in the avenues of Ju dea he was conqueror in the battle and drove away Antigonus returned to Jerusalem beloved by every body for the glorious action he had done for those who did not before favour him did join themselves to him now because of his marriage into the family of Hyrcanus  for as he had formerly married a wife out of his own country of no ignoble blood who was called Doris of whom he begat Antipater so did he marry Mariamne the daugh ter of Alexander the son of Aristobulus and the grand daugh ter of Hyrcanus and was become thereby a relation of the king 4 But when Caesar and Antony had slain Cassius near Philip pi and Caesar was gone to Italy and Antony to Asia amongst the rest of the cities which sent ambassadors to Antony unto Bithy nia the great men of the Jews came also and accused Phasae lus and Herod that they kept the government by force and that Hyrcanus had no more than an honourable name Herod ap peared ready to answer this accusation and having made Anto ny his friend by the large sums of money which he gave him he brought him to such a temper as not to hear the others speak against him and thus did they part at this time 5 However after this there came an hundred of the princi pal men among the Jews to Daphne by Antioch to Antony who was already in love with Cleopatra to the degree of slavery  these Jews put those menthatwere the most potent both indignity and eloquence foremost and accused the brethren f But Mes sala opposed them and defended the brethren and that while Hyr canus stood by him on account of his relation to them When Antony had heard both sides he asked Hyrcanus which party was the fittest to govern  who replied that Herod and his party were the fittest Antony was glad of that answer for he had been formerly treated in an hospitable and obliging manner by his father Antipater when he marched into Judea with Gabinius so he constituted the brethren tetrarchs and committed to them the government of Judea 6 Butwhen the ambassadors had indignation at this procedure Antony  Here we see that Cassius Â et tyrants over all Syria so that his assisting p f rstroy Caesar does not seem to have proceeded from his true zeal for public li berty but from a desire to be a tyrant himself t Fhaiaelus and Herod Chap XIII WARS OF THE JEWS 285 Antony took fifteen of them and put them into custody whom he was also going to kill presently and the rest he drove away with disgrace on which occasion a still greater tumult arose at Jerusalem  so they sent again a thousand ambassadors to Tyre where Antony now abode as he was marching to Jerusalem upon these men who made a clamour he sent out the governor of Tyre and ordered him to punish all that he could catch of them and to settle those in the administration whom he had made tetrarchs 7 But before this Herod and Hyrcanus went out upon the sea shore and earnestly desired of these ambassadors that they would neither bring ruin upon themselves nor war upon their native country by their rash contentions  and when they grew still more outrageous Antony sent out armed men and slew a great many and wounded more of them  of whom those that were slain were buried by Hyrcanus as were the wounded put under the care of physicians by him yet would not those that had escaped be quiet still but put the affairs of the city into such disorder and so provoked Antony that he slew those whom he had in bonds also CHAP XIII The Parthians firing Antigonus lack into Judca and cast Hyrca nus and Phasaelus into prison The flight of Herod and the taking of Jerusalem and what Hyrcanus and Phasaelus suffer ed  1 VTOW two years afterward when Barzapharnes a gover â nor among the Parthians and Pacorus the king s son had possessed themselves of Syria and when Lysanias had al ready succeeded upon his father Ptolemy the son of Menneus s death in the government of Chalcis he prevailed with the go vernor by a promise of a thousand talents and five hundred wo men to bring back Antigonus to his kingdom and to turn Hyr canus out of it Pacorus was by these means induced so to do and marched along the sea coast while he ordered Barzapharnes to fall upon the Jews as he went along the Mediterranean part of the country  but of the maritime people the Tyrians would not receive Pacorus although those of Ptolemais and Sidon had received him  so he committed a troop of his horse to a certain pup bearer belonging to the royal family of his own name Pa corus and gave him orders to march into Judea in order to learn the state of affairs among their enemies and to help Anti gpnus when he should want his assistance 2 Now as these men were ravaging Carmel many of the Jews ran V7AKS OF THE JEWS Book I ran together to Antigonus and shewed themselves ready to make an incursion into the country  so he sent them before into that place called Drymus Â the wood land to seize upon the place  whereupon a battle was fought between them and they drove thee neaiy away and pursued them and ran after them as far as Jerusalem and as their numbers increased they proceeded as far as the king s palace  but as Hyrcanus and Phasaelus received them with a strong body of men there happened a battle in the market place in which Herod s party beat the enemy and shut them up in the temple and set sixty men in the houses adjoining as a guard on them But the people that were tumultuous against the brethren came in and burnt those men  while Herod in his rage for killing them attacked and slew many of the people till one party made incursions on the other by turns day by day in the way of ambuihes and slaughters were made continually among them 3 Now when that festival which we call Pentecost was at hand all the places about the temple and the whole city was full of a multitude of people that were come out of the country and which were the greatest part of them armed also at which time Phasaelus guarded the wall and Herod with a few guarded the royal palace  and when he made an assault upon his ene mies as they were out of their ranks on the north quarter of the city he slew a very great number of them and put them all to flight and some of them he shut up within the city and others within the outward rampart In the mean time Antigonus de sired that Pacorus might be admitted to be a reconciler between them  and Phasaelus was prevailed upon to admit the Parthian into the city with five hundred horse and to treat him in an hospitable manner who pretended that he came to quell the tumult but in reality he came to assist Antigonus  however he laid a plot for Fhasaelus and persuaded him to go as an ambassador to Barza pharnes in order to put an end to the war  although Herod was â very earnest with him to the contrary and exhorted him to kill the plotter but not expose himself to the snares he had laid for him because the barbarians are naturally perfidious However Pacorus went out and took Hyrcanus with him that he might be the less suspected  he also left some of the horsemen f called the  This large and noted wood or woodland belonging to Carmel called by the Septuagint is mentioned in the Old Testament 2 Kings xix 23 and Isa xxxviii 24 and by Strabo B XVI p 758 as both Aldrich and Spanheim here remark very pertinently t These accounts both here fand Antiq B XIV ch xiii sect 5 that the Parthians fought chiefly on horseback and that only some few of their sol diers were freemen perfectly agree with Trogus Pompeius in Justin B XI z 3 as Dean Aldrich well observes on this place Chap XIII WARS OF THE Jtws 287 the Freemen with Herod and conducted Phasaelus with the rest 4 But now when they were come to Galilee they found that the people of that country had revolted and were in arms who came very cunningly to their leader and besought him to conceal his treacherous intentions by an obliging behaviour to thetn accordingly he at first made them presents and afterward as they went away laid ambushes for them  and when they were come to one of the maritime cities called Ecdippon they perceived that a plot was laid for them  for they were there informed of ths promise of a thousand talents and how Antigonus had devoted the greatest number of the women that were there with them among the five hundred to the Parthians  they also perceived that an ambush was always laid for them by the barbarians in the night time  they had also been seized on before this unless they had waited for the seizure of Herod first at Jerusalem because if he were once informed of this treachery of theirs he would take care of himself nor was this a mere report but they saw the guards already not far off them 5 Nor would Phasaelus think of forsaking Hyrcanus and flying away although Ophellius earnestly persuaded him to it for this man had learned the whole scheme of the plot from Sa ramalla the richest of all the Syrians But Phasaelus went up to the Parthian governor and reproached him to his face for laying this treacherous plot against thetn and chiefly because he had done it for money  and he promised him that he would give him more money for their preservation than Antigonus had promised to give for the kingdom But the sly Parthian endea voured to remove all this suspicion by apologies and by oaths and then went to the other Pacorus immediately after which those Parthians who were left and had it in charge seized upon Phasaelus and Hyrcanus who could do no more than curse their perfidiousness and their perjury 6 In the mean time the cup bearer was sent back and laid a plot how to seize upon Herod by deluding him and getting him out of the city as he was commanded to do But Herod sus pected the barbarians from the beginning and having then re ceived intelligence that a messenger who was to bring him the letters that informed him of the treachery intended had fallen among the enemy he would not go out of the city  though Pa corus said very positively that he ought to go out and meet the messengers that brought the letters for that the enemy had not them and that the contents of them were not accounts of any plots upon them but of what Phasaelus had done  yet had he heard 266 WARS OF THE JEWS Book T heard from others that his brother was seized  and Alexandra the shrewdest woman in the world Hyrcanus s daughter begged of him that he would not go out nor trust himself to those bar barians who now were come to make an attempt upon him openly 7 Now as Pacorus and his friends were considering how they might bring their plot to bear privately because it was not possible to circumvent a man of so great prudence by openly attacking him Herod prevented them and went off with the per sons that were the most nearly related to him by night and this without their enemies being apprised of it But as soon as the Parthians perceived it they purfued after them and as he gave orders for his mother and sister and the young woman who was betrothed to him with her mother and his youngest brother to make the best of their way he himself with his fervants took all the care they could to keep off the barbarians  and when at every assault he had slain a great many of them he came to the strong hold of Masada 8 Nay he found by experience that the Jews fell more hea vily upon him than did the Parthians and created him troubles perpetually and this ever since he was gotten sixty furlongs from the city these sometimes brought it to a sort of a regular battle Now in the place where Herod beat them and killed a great number of them there he afterward built a citadel in me mory of the great actions he did there and adorned it with the most costly palaces and erected very strong fortifications and called it from his own name Herodium Now as they were in their flight many joined themselves to him every day  and at a place called Thressa of Idumea his brother Joseph met him and advised him to ease himself of a great number of his followers because Masada would not contain so great a multitude which were above nine thousand Herod complied with this advice and sent away the most cumbersome part of his retinue that they might go into Idumea and gave them provisions for their jour ney  but he got safe to the fortress with his nearest relations and retained Wlthjhitn only the stoutest of his followers and there it was that he left eight hundred of his men as a guard for the women and provisions sufficient for a siege but he made haste himself to Petra of Arabia 9 As for the Parthians in Jerusalem they betook themselves to plundering arid fell upon the houses of those that were fled and upon the king s palace and spared nothing but Hyrcanus s money which was not above three hundred talents They light ef other men s money also but not of so much as they hoped for for Â Mariamne here in the copies Chap XIV WARS OF THE JEWS 289 for Herod having a long while had a suspicion of the perfidious ness of the barbarians had taken care to have what was most splendid among his treasures conveyed into Idumea as every one belonging to him had in like manner done also But the Par thians proceeded to that degree of injustice as to fill all the coun try with war without denouncing it and to demolish the city Marissa and not only to set up Antigonus for king but to deli ver Phasaelus and Hyrcanus bound into his hands in order to their being tormented by him Antigonus himself also bit off Hyrcanus sears with his own teeth as he fell down upon his knees to him that so he miyht never be able upon any mutation of affairs to take the high priesthood again  for the high priests that officiated were to be complete and without blemish 10 However he failed in his purpose of abusing Phasaelus by reason of his courage for though he neither had the command of his sword nor of his hands he prevented all abuses by dashing his head against a stone  so he demonstrated himself to be He rod s own brother and Hyrcanus a most degenerate relation and died with great bravery and made the end of his life agreeable to the actions of it There is also another report about his end viz that he recovered of that stroke and that a surgeon who was sent by Antigonus to heal him filled the wound with poi sonous ingredients andsokilledhim which soever of these deaths he came to the beginning of it was glorious It is also report ed that before he expired he was informed by a certain poor woman how Herod had escaped out of his hands and that he said thereupon  1 now die with comfort since I leave behind  me one alive that will avenge me of mine enemies H This was the death of Phasaelus but the Parthians al though they had failed of the woman they chiefly desired yet did they put the government of Jerusalem into the hands of An tigonus and took away Hyrcanus and bound him and carried him to Parthia CHAP XIV When Herod is rejected in Arabia ie makes laste to Rome where Antony and C ssar join their interest to make him king of the Jews Â 1 TOW Herod did the more zealously pursue his journey LN into Arabia as making has te to get money of the king while his brother was yet alive by which money alone it was that he hoped to prevail upon the covetous temper of the barba rians to spare Phasaelus for he reasoned thus with himself that if the Arabian king was too forgetful of his father s friendship with him and was too covetous to make him a free gift he would VOL III O o however 290 WARS OF THE JEWS Book I however borrow of him zs much as might redeem his brother aiid put into his hands as a pledge the son of him that was to be redeemed  accordingly he led his brother s son along with him who was of the age of seven years Now he was ready to give three hundred talents for his brother and intended to desire the intecession of the Tyrians to get them accepted  however fate had been too quick for his diligence  and since Phasaelus was dead Herod s brotherly love was now in vain Moreover he was not able to find any lasting friendship among the Arabi ans for their king Mali thus sent to him immediately and com manded him to returnback out of his country and used the name of the Parthenians as a pretence for so doing as though these had denounced to him by their ambassadors to cast Herod out of Arabia  while in reality they had amind to keep back what they owed to Antipater and not be obliged to make requitals to his sons for the free gifts the father had made them He also took the impudent advice of those who equally with himself were willing to deprive Herod of what Antipater had deposited among them  and these men were the most potent of all whom he had in his kingdom 2 So when Herod had found that the Arabians were his ene mies and this for those very reasons whence he hoped they would have been the most friendly and had given them such an answer as hispassion suggested he returnedback and went for Egypt Now he lodged the first evening at one of the temples of that country in order to meet with those whomhe left behind but on the next day word was brought him as he was going to Rhinocurura that his brother was dead and how he came by his death  and when he had lamented him as much as his present circumstances could bear he soon laid aside such cares and proceeded on his journey But now after some time the king of Arabia repented of what he had done and sent presently away messengers to call him back Herod had prevented them and was come to Pelusium where he could not obtain a passage from those that lay with the fleet so he besought their captains to let him go by them  accordingly out of the reverence they bore to the fame and dignity of the man they conducted him to Alexandria and when he came in to the city he was received by Cleopatra with great splendour who hoped he might be persuaded to be commander of her for ces in the expedition she was now about but he rejected the queen s solicitations and being neither affrighted at the height of that storm which then happened nor at the tumults that were now in Italy he sailed for Rome i 3 But as he was in peril about Pamphilia and obliged to cast cm the greatest part of the ships lading he with difficulty got Chap XIV  WARS OF THE JEWS 291 Safe to Rhodes a place which had been grievously harassed in the war with Cassius He was there received by his friends Pto lemy and Sappinius  and although he was then in want of money he fitted up a three decked ship of very great magnitude wherein he and his friends sailed to  Brundusium and went thence to Rome with all speed  where he first of all went to Antony on account of the friendship his father had with him and laid before him the calamities of himself and his family and that he had left his nearest relations besieged in a fortress and had sailed to him through a storm to make supplication to him for assistance 4 Flereupon Antony was moved to compassion at the change that had been made in Herod s affairs and this both upon his calling to mind how hospitably he had been treated by Antipater but more especially on account of Herod s own virtue so he then resolved to get him made king of the Jews whom he had himself former ly made tetrach The contest also that he had with Antigonus was another inducement and that of no lessweight than the great regard he had for Herod for he looked upon Antigonus as a se ditious person and an enemy of the Romans  and as for Caesar Herod found him better prepared than Antony as remembering very fresh the wars he had gone through together with his fa ther the hospitable treatment he had met with from him and the entire good will he had shewed to him besides the activity which he saw in Herod himself So he called the senate toge ther wherein Messalas and after him Atratinus produced He rod before them and gave a full account of the merits of his fa ther and his own good will to the Romans At the same time they demonstrated that Antigonus was their enemy not only be cause he soon quarrelled with them but because he now over looked theRomans and took thegovernment by the means of the Parthians These reasons greatly moved the senate at which juncture Antony came in and told them that it was for their advantage in the Parthian war that Herod should be king so they all gave their votes for it And when the senate was se parated Antony and Csesar went out with Herod between them while the consul and the rest of the magistrates went before them in order to offer sacrifices and to lay the decree in the capitol  Antony also made a feast for Herod on the first day of his reign Â This Brentesium or Biundusium has coin still preserved on which ii written Sfir if t aa Spanheim here informs us O o 2 CHAP WARS OF THE JEWS Book  CHAP XV Antigonus besieges tlose that were in Masada ivhom Herod frets from confinement when he came back from Rome and present ly marches to Jerusalem where he findt Silo corrupted by bribes  1 T T OW during this time Antigonus besieged those that J N were in Masada who had all other necessaries in suffi cient quantity but were in want of water  on which account Joseph Herod s brother was disposed to run away to the Ara bians with two hundred of his own friends because he had heard that Malichus repented of his offences with regard to Herod  and he had been so quick as to have been gone out of the fortress already unless on that very night when he was going away there had fallen a great deal of rain insomuch that his re servoirs were full of water and so he was under no necessity of running away After which therefore they made an irruption upon Antigonus s party and slew a great many of them some in open battles and some in private ambush nor had they al ways success in their attempts for sometimes they were beaten and ran away 2 In the mean time Ventidius the Roman general was sent out of Syria to restrain the incursions of the Parthians and after he had done that he came into Judea in pretence indeed to assist Joseph and his party but in reality to get money of Antigonusj and when he had pitched his camp very near to Jerusalem as soon as he had got money enough he went away with the great estpart of his forces yet still did he leave Silo with some part of them lest if he had taken them all away his taking of bribes might have been too openly discovered Now Antigonus hoped that the Parthians would come again to his assistance and there O  fore cultivated a good understanding with Silo in the mean time lest any interruption should be given to his hopes 3 Now by this time Herod had sailed out of Italy and was come to Ptolemais  and as soon as he had gotten together no small army of foreigners and of his own countrymen he march ed through Galilee against Antigonus wherein he was assisted by Ventidius andSilo7bothwbom Dtllius a person sent by Antony persuaded to bring Herod into his kingdom Now Ventidius was at tills time among the cities and composing the disturban ces which had happened by means ot the Parthians as was Silo in Judea corrupted by the bribes that Antigonus had given him yet was not Herod himself destitute of power but the number of his Â This Dellius U famors or rather infamous in the history of Mark AMony ai Spanheim and Aldrich here note from the coins from Plutarch and Die Chap XV WARS or THE JEWS 2Q3 his forces increased every day as he went along and all Galilee with few exceptions joined themselves to him So he proposed to himself to set about his most necessary enterprise and that was Masada in order to deliver his relations from the siege they endured But still Joppa stood in his way and hindered his go ing thither for it was necessary to take that city first which was in the enemies hands that when he should go to Jerusalem no fortress might be left in the enemies power behind him Silo also willingly joined him as having now a plausible occasion of drawing off his forces from Jerusalem and when the Jews pursued him and pressed upon him in his retreat Herod made an excursion upon then with a small body of his men and soon put them to flight and saved Silo when he was in distress 4 After this Herod took Joppa and then made haste to Masa da to free his relations Now as he was marching many came in to him induced some by their friendship to his father some by the reputation he had already gained himself and some in rder to repay the benefits they had received from them both but still what engaged the greatest number on his side was the hopes from him when he should be established in his kingdom  so that he had gotten together already an army hard to be con quered But Antigonus laid an ambush for him as he marched out in which he did little or no harm to his enemies However he easily recovered his relations again that were in Masada as well as the fortress Ressa and then marched to Jerusalem where the soldiers that were with Silo joined themselves to his own as did many out of the city from a dread of his power 5 Now when he had pitched his camp on the west side of the city the guards that were there shot their arrows and threw their darts at them while others ran out in companies and at tacked those in the forefront but Herod commanded procla mation to be made at the wall that  he was come for the good of the  people and the preservation of the city without any design to  be revenged on his open enemies but to grant oblivion to them  though they had been the most obstinate against him Now the soldiers that were for Antigonus made a contrary clamour and did neither permit any body to hear that proclamation nor to change their party so Antigonus gave order to his forces to beat the enemy from the walls accordingly they soon threw their darts at them from the towers and put them to flight 6 Andhere it wasthatSilo discovered hehad taken bribes for he set many of the soldiers to clamour about their want of ntces saries and to require their pay in order to buy themselves food and to demand that he would lead them into places convenientfor their winter quarters because all the parts about the city were 294 WARS of the JEWS Book I laid waste by the means of Antigonus s army which had taken all things away By this he moved the army and attempted to get them off the siege but Herod went to the captains that were under Silo and to a great many of the soldiers and begged of them not to leave him who was sent thither by Caesar and Antony and the senate for that he would take care to have their wants supplied that very day After the making of which entreaty he went hastily into the country and brought thither so great an abundance of necessaries that he cut off all Silo s pretences and in order to provide that for the following days they should not want supplies he sent to the people that were about Samaria which cityhad joined itself tohim to bring corn and wine and oil and cattle to Jericho When Antigonus heard of this he sent some of his party with orders to hinder and lay ambushes for these collectors of corn This command was obeyed and a great multitude of armed men were gathered together about Jericho and lay upon the mountains to watch those that brought the provisions Yet was Herod not idle but took with him ten cohorts five of them were Romans and five were Jewish cohorts together with some mercenary troops in termixed among them and besides those a few horsemen and came to Jericho and when he came he found the city deserted but that there were five hundred men with their wives and chil dren who had taken possession of thetopsof the mountains these he took and dismissed them while the Romans fell upon the rest of the city and plundered it having found the houses full of all sorts of good things So the king left a garrison at Jericho and came back and sent the Roman army into those cities which were come over to him to take their winter quarters there visa ints Judea or Idumea and Galilee and Samaria Antigonus also by bribes obtained of Silo to let a part of his army be re ceived at Lydda as a compliment to Antonius CHAP XVI Herod takes Sepphoru and subdues the robbers that were in the caves be after that avenges himsilf upon Macheras as upon an enemy of his and goes to Antony as he was besieging Samosata  1 QO the Romans lived in plenty of all things and rested k3 from war However Herod did not lie at rest but seiied upon Idumea and kept it with two thousand footmen and four hundred horsemen and this he did by sending his bro ther Joseph thither that no innovation might be made by Anti gonus He dso removed his mother and all his relations who had beer in Masada to Samaria and when he had settled them securely Chap XVI yrARS OF THE JEWS 295 securely he marched to take the remaining parts of Galilee and to drive away the garrisons placed there by Antigonus 2 But when Herod had reached  Sepphoris in a very great snow he took the city without any difficulty the guards that should have kept it flying away before it was assaulted where he gave an opportunity to his followers that had been in distress to refresh themselves there bein g in that city a great abundance of necessaries After which he hasted away to the robbers that were in the caves who over ran a great part of the country and did as great mischief to its inhabitants as a war itself could have done Accordingly he sent before hand three cohorts of footmen and one troop of horsemen to the village Arbela and came himself f forty days afterwards with the rest of his forces Yet were not the enemy affrighted at his assault but met him in arms for their skill was that of warriors but theif boldness was the boldness of robbers when therefore it cam6 to a pitched battle they put to flight Herod s left wing with their right one but Herod wheeling about on the sudden from his own right wing came to their assistance and both made his own left wing return back from its flight and fell upon the pursuers and cooled their courage till they could not bear the attempts that were made directly upon them and so turned back and ran away 3 But Herod followed them and slew them as he followed them and destroyed a great part of them till those that re i mained were scattered beyond the river Jordan and Galilee was freed from the terrors they had been under excepting from those that remained and lay concealed in caves which re quired longer time ere they could be conquered In order to which Herod in the first place distributed the fruits of their former labours to the soldiers and gave every one of them an hundred and fifty drachmae of silver and a great deal more to their commanders and sent them into their winter quarters He also sent to his youngest brother Pheroras to take care of a good market for them where they might buy themselves pro visions and to build a wall about Alexandrium who took care of both those injunctions accordingly 4 In  This Sepphoris the metropolis of

ordered them first to settle the affairs of Judea so Herod willingly dismissed Silo to go to Ventidius but he made an expedition himself against those that lay in the caves Now these caves were in the precipices of craggy mountains and could not be come at from any side since they had only some winding path ways very narrow by which they got up to them but the rock that lay on their front had beneath it val leys of a vast depth and of an almost perpendicular declivity insomuch that the king was doubtful for a long time what to do by reason of a kind of impossibility there was of attacking the place Yet did he at length make use of a contrivance that was subject to the utmost hazard for he let down the most hardy of his men in chests and set them at the mouths of the dens Now these men slew the robbers and their families and when they made resistance they sent in fire upon them and burnt them  and as Herod was desirous of saving some of them he had proclamation made that they should come and deliver themselves up to him but not one of them came willingly to him and of those that were compelled to come many preferred death to captivity And here a certain old man the father of seven children whose children together with their mother de sired him to give them leave to go out upon the assurance and right hand that was offered them slew them after the following manner He ordered every one of them to go out while he stood himself at the cave s mouth and slew that son of his per petually who went out Herod was near enough to see this sight and his bowels of compassion were moved at it and he stretched out his right hand to the old man and besought him to spare his children yet did not he relent at all upon what he said but over and above reproached Herod on the lowness of his descent and slew his wife as well as his children and when be had thrown their dead bodies down the precipice he at last threw himself down after them 5 By this means Herod subdued these caves and the robbers that were in them He then left there a part of his army as many as he thought sufficient to prevent any sedition and made Ptolemy their general and returned to Samaria heled also with him three thousand armed footmen and six hundred horsemen against AntigonuaÂ Now here those that used to raise tumults in Ga lilee having liberty so to do upon his departure fell unexpected ly upon Ptolemy the general of his forces and slew him they also laid the country waste and then retired to the bogs and to places not easily to be found But when Herod was informed of this insurrection he came to the assistance of the country imme diately Chap XVI WARS OF THE JEWS 297 th ately and destroyed a great number of the seditious and raised the sieges of all those fortresses they had besieged he also exact ed the tribute of an hund ed talents of his enemies as a penalty or the mutations they had made in the country 6 By this time the Parthians being already driven out of the country and Pacorus slain Ventidius by Antony s command sent a thousand horsemen and two legions as auxiliaries to He rod against Antigonus Now Antigonus besought Macheras who was their general by letter tocome tohisassistance andmade a great many mournful complaints about Herod s violence and about the injuries he did to the kingdom and promised to give him money for such his assistance but he complied not with his invitation to betray his trust for he did not contemn him that sent him especially while Herod gave him more money than the other offered So he pretended friendship to Antigonus but came as a spy to discover his affairs although he did not here in comply with He rod who dissuaded him from so doing But Antigonus perceived what his intentions were before hand and excluded him out tjf the city and defended himself against him as against an enemy from the walls  till Macheras was ashamed of what he had done and retired to Emmaus to Herod and as he was in a rage at his disappointment he slew all the Jews whom he met with without sparing those that were for Hero d but using them all as if they were for Antigonus 1 Hereupon Herod was very angry at him and was going to fight against Macheras as his enemy but he restrained his indig nation and marched to Antony to accuse Macheras of maj administration But Macheras was made sensible of his offences andfollowed after the king immediately andearnestly begged and obtained that he would be reconciled to him However Herod did not desist from his resolution of going to Antony but wheu he heard that he was besieging  Samosata with a great army which is a strong city near to Euphrates he made the greater haste as observing that this was aproper opportunity for shew ing at once his courage and for doing what would greatly oblige Antony Indeed when he came he soon made an end of that siege and slew a great number of the barbarians and took from them a large prey  insomuch that Antony who admired his courage formerly did now admire it still more Accordingly he heaped many more honours upon him and gave him more as sured hopes that he should gain his kingdom and now king Antiochus was forced to deliver up Samosata CHAP Â This Samosata the metropolis of Commagena is well known from its coins as Spanheim here as ures us Dean Aldrich also confirms what Josephus here notes that Herod was a great meaiis of taking the city by Antony and that from PkÂ Orch and D10 VOL III P p 298 Book t WARS OF THE JEWS CHAP XVII The death of Joseph Herod s brother which had been signified to Herod in dreams How Herod was preserved twice after  a wonderful manner He cuts off the head of Pappus who was the murderer of his brother and sends that head to his other brother Pheroras Andin no long time he besieges Jerusalem and marries Mariamne  1 TN the mean time Herod s affairs in Judea were in an ill X state He had left his brother Joseph with full power but had charged him to make no attempts against Antigonus till his return for that Macheraswould not be such an assistantas he could depend on as it appeared by what he had done already  but as soon as Joseph heard that his brother was at a very great distance he neglected the charge he had received and marched towards Jericho with five cohorts which Macheras sent with him This movement was intended for seizing on the corn as it was now in the midst of summer  but when his enemies at tacked him in the mountains and in places which were difficult to pass he was both killed himself as he was very bravely fighting inthebattle andtheentireRomancohortswere destroyed forthese cohorts were new raised men gathered out of Syria and there was no mixture of those called veteran soldiers among them who might have supported those that were unskilful in war 2 This victory was not sufficient for Antigonus but he pro ceeded to that degree of rage as to treat the dead body of Jo seph barbarously for when he had gotten possession of the bodies of those that were slain he cut off his head although his brother Pheroras would have given fifty talents as a price of redemption for it And now the affairs of Galilee were put in such disorder after this victory of Antigonus s that those of Antigonus s party brought the principal men that were on Herod s side to the lake and there drowned them There was a great change made also in Idumea where Macheras was building a wall about one of the fortresses which was called Gittha But Herod had not yet been informed of these things  for after the taking of Samc sata and when Antony had set Sosius over the affairs of Syria and given him orders to assist Herod against Antigonus he de parted into Egypt but Sosius sent two legions before him into Judea to assist Herod and followed himself soon after with the rest of his army 3 Now when Herod was atDaphne by Antioch he had some dreams which clearly foreboded his brother s death and as he leaped outof hisbedin a disturbedmanner therecame messengers that acquainted him with that calamity So whenhe had lament ed Chap XVII Wars of the Jews 299 ted this misfortune for a while he put off the main part of his mourning and made haste to march against his enemies and when he had performed a march that was above his strength end was gone as far as Libanus he got him eight hundred men of those that lived near to that mountain as his assistants and joined with them one Roman legion with which before it was day he made an irruption into Galilee and met his enemies and drove them back to the place which they had left He also made an immediate and continual attack upon the fortress Yet was he forced by a most terrible storm to pitch his camp in the neighbouring villages before he could take it but when after a few days time the second legion that came from Antony joined themselves to him the enemy were affrighted at his power and left their fortifications in the night time 4 After this he marched through Jericho as making what haste he could to be avenged on his brother s murderers where happened to him a providential sign out of which when he had unexpectedly escaped he had the reputation of being very dear to God for that evening there feasted with him many of the principal men and after that feast was over and all the guests were gone out the house fell down immediately And as he judged this to be a common signal of what dangers he should un dergo and how he shouldescape them in the war that he was go ing about he in the morning set forward with his army when about six thousand of his enemies came running down from the mountains and began to fight with those in his forefront yet durst they not be so very bold as to engage the Romans hand to hand but threw stones and darts at them at a distance by which means they wounded a considerable number  in which action Herod s own side was wounded with a dart 5 Now as Antigonus had a mind to appear to exceed Herod not only in the courage but in the number of his men he sent Pappus one of his companions with an army against Samaria whose fortune it was to oppose Macheras but Herod over ran the enemies country and demolished five little cities and des troyed two thousand men that were in them and burned their houses and then returned to his camp but his head quarters were at the village called Carta 5 Now a great multitude of Jews resorted to him every day both out of Jericho and the other parts of the country Some were moved so to do out of their hatred to Antigonus and some out of regard to the glorious actions Herod had done but others Were led on by an unreasonable desire of change so he fell upon them immediately As for Pappus and his party they were not terrified either at their number or at their ieal but marched out Pp2 with WARS OF THE JEWS Book f with great alacrity to fight them and it came to a close fight Now other parts of their army made resistance for a while but Herod running the utmost hazard out of the rage he was in at the murder of his brother that he might be avenged on those that had been the authors of it soon beat those that opposed him and after he had beUen them he alwavs turned his force against those that stood to it still and pursued them all so that a great slaughter was made while some were forced back into that vil lage whence they came out he also pressed hard upon the hin dermost and slew a vast number of them he also fell into the village with the enemy where every house was filled with arm ed men and the upper rooms were crowded above with soldiers for their defence and when he had beaten those that were oa the outside he pulled the houses to pieces and plucked out those that were within upon many he had the roofs shaken down whereby they perished by heaps and as for those that fled out of the ruins the soldiers received them with their swords in their hands and the multitude of those slain and lying on heaps was so great that the conquerors could not pass along the roads Now the enemy could not bear this blow so that when the multitude of them which was gathered together saw that those in the village were slain they dispersed themselves and fled away upon the confidence of which victory Herod had march ed immediately to Jerusalem unless he had been hindered by the depth of winter s coming on This was the impediment that lay in the way of this his entire glorious progress and was what hindered Antigonus from being now conquered who was already disposed to forsake the city 1 Now when at the evening Herod had already dismissed his friends to refresh themselves after their fatigue and when he was gone himself while he was still hot in his armour like a common soldier to bathe himself and had but one servant that attended him and before he was gotten into the bath one of the enemies met him in the face with a sword in his hand and then a second and then a third and after that more of them  these weremenwhohad run away out of the battle into the bath in their armour and they had lain there for some time in great terror and in privacy and when they saw the king they trem bled for fear and ran by him in a fright although he were na ked and endeavoured to get oft into the public road now there was by chance nobody else at hand that might seize upon these men and for Herod he was contented to have come to no harm himself so that they all got away in safety S But on the next day Herod had Pappus s head cut off who was the general for Antigonus and was slain in the battle and sent Chap XVIII WARS OF THE JEWS SOI sent it to his brother Pheroras by way of punishment for their slain brother for he was the man that slew Joseph Now as winter was going off Herod marched to Jerusalem and brought his army to the wall of it this vas the third year s ince he had been made king at Rome so he pitched his camp before the temple for on that side it might be besieged and there it was that Pompey took the city So he parted the work among the army and demolished the suburbs and raised three banks and gave orders to have towers built upon those banks and left the most laborious of his acquaintance at the works But he went himself to Samaria to take the daughter of Alexander the son of Aristobulus to wife who had been betrothed to him before as we have already said and thus he accomplished this by the bye during the siege of the city for he had his enemy in great contempt already 9 When he had thus married Mariamne he came back to Je rusalem w ith a greater army Sosius also joined him with a large army both of horsemen and footmen which he sent be fore him through the midland parts while he marched himself along Phenicia and when the whole army was gotten together which were eleven regiments of footmen and six thousand horsemen besides the Syrian auxiliaries which was no small part of the army they pitched their camp near to the north wall Herod s dependence was upon the decree of the senate by which he was made king and Sosius relied upon Antony who sent the army that was under him to Herod s assistance CHAP XVIII How Herod and Sosius took Jerusalem by force and what death Antigonus came to Alto concerning Cleopatra s aiiariciout temper Â 1 T OW the multitude of the Jews that were in the city L l were divided into several factions for the people ihat crowded about the temple being the weaker part of them gave it out that as the times were he was the happiest and most religious man who should die first But as to the more bold and hardy men they got together in bodies and fell a rob bing others after various manners and these particularly plun dered the places that were about the city and this because there was no food left either for the horses or the men yet some of the warlike men xvlio were used to fight regularly were ap pointed to defend the city during the siege and these drove those that raided the banks aivay from the wall and these were always inventing one engine or another to be an hindrance to tl 302 WARS OF THE JEWS Book f the engines of the enemy nor had they so much success any way as in the mines under ground 2 Now as for the robberies which were committed the king contrived that ambushes should be so laid that they might re strain their excursions and as for the want of provisions he provided that they should be brought to them from great dis tances He was also too hard for the Jews by the Romans skill in the art of war although they were bold to the utmost degree now they durst not come to a plain battle with the Romans which was certain death but through their mines under ground they would appear in the midst of them on the sudden and be fore they could batter down one wall they built them another in its stead and to sum up all at once they did not shew any want either of pains taking or of contrivances as having resolved to hold out to the very last Indeed though they had so great an ar my lying round about them they bore a siege of five months till some of Herod s chosen men ventured to get upon the wall and fell into the city as did Sosius s centurions after them and now they first of all seized upon what was about the temple and up on the pouring in of the army there was slaughter of vast mul titudes every where by reason of the rage the Romans were in at the length of this siege and by reason that the Jews who were about Herod earnestly endeavoured that none of their adversa ries might remain so they were cut to pieces by great multitudes as they were crowded together in narrow streets and in houses or were running away to the temple nor was there any mercy shewed either to infants or to the aged or to the weaker sex insomuch that although the king sent about and desired them to spare the people nobodycouldbe persuaded to withhold their right hand from slaughter but they slew people of all ages like madmen Then it was that Antigonus without any regard to his former or to his present fortune came down from the cita del and fell down at Sosius s feet who without pitying him at all upon the change of his condition laughed at him beyond measure and called him dntigona  Yet did he not treat him like a woman or let him go free but put him into bonds and kept him in custody 3 But Herod s concern at present now he had gotten his ene mies under his power was to restrain the ieal of his foreign aux iliaries for the multitude of the strange people were very eager to see the temple and what was sacred in the holy house itself but the king endeavoured to restrain them partly by hisexhorta tions partly by his threntemngs nav partly by force as think ing the victory worse than a defeat to him if any thing that ought not to be seen were seen by them He also forbade at the same   That is A woman not a man Chap XVIII WARS OF THE JEWS 393 same time the spoiling of the city asking Sosius in the most earnest manner whether the Romans by thus emptying the ci ty of money and men had a mind to leave him king of a desertj and told him That  he judged the dominion of the habitable  earth too small a compensation for the slaughter of so many ci  tizens Andwhen Sosius said  That it was but just to allow  the soldiers this plunder as a reward for what they suffered during the siege Herod made answer that he would give e  very one of the soldiers a reward out of his own money So he purchased the deliverance of his country and performed his promises to them and made presents after a magnificent man ner to each soldier and proportionably to their commanders and with a most royal bounty to Sosius himself whereby nobody went away but in a wealthy condition Hereupon Sosius dedi cated a crown of gold to God and then went away from Jerusa lem leading Antigonus away in bonds to Antony then did the  ax bring him to his end who still had a fond desire of life and some frigid hopes of it to the last but by his cpwardly be haviour well deserved to die by it 4 Hereupon king Herod distinguished the multitude that was in the city and for those that were of his side he made them still more his friends by the honours he conferred on them but for those of Antigonus s party he slew them and as his money ran low he turned all the ornaments he had into money and sent it to Antony and to those about him Yet could he not hereby purchase an exemption from all sufferings for An tony was now bewitched by his love to Cleopatra and was en tirely conquered by her charms Now Cleopatra had put to death all her kindred till no one near her in blood remained a live and after that she fell a slaying those no way related to her So she calumniated the principal men among the Syrians to An tony andpersuaded him to have them slain that so she might ea sily gain to be mistress of what they had nay she extended her avaricious humour to the Jews and Arabians and secretly la boured to have Herod and Malichus the kings of both those nations slain by his order 5 Now as to these her injunctions to Antony he complied in part for though he esteemed it too abominable a thing to kill such good and great kings yet was he thereby alienated fromthe friendship he had for them He also took away a great deal of their country nay even the plantation of palm trees at Jericho where also grows the balsam tree and bestowed them upon her as  This death of Atuiponus is confirmed by Plutarch and Strabo the latter of whom is cited for it by Josephu himself Antiq B XV cli i sect z Vol II as Dean Aldrich here observes 304 Book I WARS OF THE JEWS as also all the cities on this side the river Eleutherus Tyre and Sidon  excepted And when she was become mistress of these and had conducted Antony in his expedition against the Par thians as far as Euphrates she came by Apamia and Damas cus into Judea and there did Herod pacify her indignation at him by large presents He also hired of her those places that had been torn away from his kingdom at the yearly rent of two hundred talents He conducted her also as far as Pelusium and paid all the respects possible Now it was not long after this that Antony was come back from Parthia and led with him Artabazes Tigranes s son captive as a present for Cleo patra  for this Parthian was presently given her with his money and all the prey that was taken with him CHAP XIX ffow Antony at the persuasion of Cleopatra sent Herod to fight against the Arabians and how after several battles he at length got the victory As also concerning a great earthquake f l T OW when the war about Actium was begun Herod L i prepared to come to the assistance of Antony as being already freed from his troubles in Judea and having gained Hyrcania which was a place that was held by Antigonus s sis ter However he was cunningly hindered from partaking of the hazards that Antony went through by Cleopatra for since as we have already noted she had laid a plot against the kings Â of Judea and Arabia she prevailed with Antony to commit the war against the Arabians to Herod that so if he got the better she might become mistress of Arabia or if he were worsted of Judea i and that she might destroy one of those kings by the other 2 However this contrivance tended to the advantage of He rod for at the very first he took hostages from the enemy and got together a great body of horse and ordered them to march against them about Diospolis and he conquered that army al though it fought resolutely against him After which defeat the Arabians were in great motion and assembledthemselvesto gether at Kanatha a city of Celesvria in vast multitudes and waited for the Jews And when Herod was come thither he tried to manage this war with particular prudence and gave or ders that they should build a wall about their camp yet did not the â This ancient libety of Tyre and Sidon under the Romans taken notice of by Josephus both here and Antiq B XV ch iv sect I Vol II is confirmed by the testimony oi Strabo B XVI p 757 as Dean Aldrich remarks although a he justly adds this liberty lasted but a little while lorger when Augustus took jr away from them  1 Chap XIX WARS OF THE JEWS 305 the multitude eomply with those orders but were so embold ened by their foregoing victory that they presently attacked the Arabians and beat them at the first onset and then pursu ed them yet were there snares laid for Herod in that pursuit while Athenio who was one of Cleopatra s generals and al ways an antagonist to Herod sent out of Kanatha the men of that country against him for upon this fresh onset the Ara bians took courage and returned back and both joined their numerous forces about stoney places that were hard to be gone over and there put Herod s men to the rout and made a great slaughter of them but those that escaped out of the battle fled to Ormiza where the Arabians surrounded their camp and took it with all the men in it 3 In a little time after this calamity Herod came to bring them succours but he came too late Now the occasion of that blow was this that the officers would not obey orders for had not the fight began so suddenly Athenio had not found a proper season for tbe snares he laid for Herod however he was even with the Arabians afterward and over run their country and did them more harm than their single victory could compensate But as he was avenging himself on his enemies there fell upon him another providential calamity  for in the  seventh year of his reign when the war about Actium was at the height at the beginning of the spring the earth was shaken and destroyed an immense number of cattle with thirty thousand men but the army received no harm because it lay in the open air In the mean time the fame of this earthquake elevated the Arabians to greater courage and thisby augmenting it to a fabulous height as is constantly the case in melancholy accidents and pretending that all Judea was overthrown upon this supposal therefore that they should easily get a landthat was destituteof inhabitants into their power they first sacrificed those ambassadors who were come to them from the Jews and then marched into Judea im mediately Now the Jewish nation were affrighted at this in vasion andquite dispiritedatthegreatnessoftheircalamities one after another whom yet Herod got together and endeavoured to  Th s seventh year of the reign of Herod from the conquests or death of An tigonus with the great earthquake in the beginning of the same spring which are here fully implied to be not much before the fight at Actium between Ocuvius and Antony and which is known from the Roman historians to have been in the beginning of September in the 3151 year before the Christian sra determines the chronology of Joessphus as to the reign of Herod viz that he began in the year  7 beyond rational contradiction Nor is it quite unworthy of our notice that thiÂ seventh year of the reign of Herod or the jlst before the Christian jera con tained the latter part of a Sabbatic year on which Sabbatic year therefore it is plain this great earthquake happened in Judea VOL III 306 WARS OF THE JEWS Book I to defend them elves by the following speech which he made to them 4  The present dread you are under seems to me to hara  seized upon you very unreasonably It is true you might  justlybedismayedat that providential chastisement whichhath  befallen you but to suffer yourselves to be equally terrified  at the invasion of men is unmanly As for myself I am so  far from being affrighted at our enemies after this earthquake  that I imagine that God hath thereby laid a bait for the Ara  bians that we may be avenged on them for their present  invasion proceeds more from our accidental misfortunes than  that they have any great dependence on their weapons or  their own fitness for action Now that hope which depend  not on men s own power but on others ill success is a very  ticklish thing for there is no certainty among men eithefr  in their bad or good fortunes but we may easily observe  that fortune is mutable and goes from one side to another  and this you may readily learn from examples among our  selves  for when you were once victors in the former fight  your enemies overcame you at last and very likely it will  now happen so that these who think themselves sure of beat  ing you will themselves be beaten For when men are very  confident they are not upon their guard while fear teaches  men to act with caution insomuch that I venture to prove  from your very timorousness that you ought to take cour  age for when you were more bold than you ought to have  been and than I would have had you and marched on  Athenio s treachery took place but your present slowness  and seeming dejection of mirftl is to me a pledge and assurance  of victory And indeed it is proper before hand to be thus  provident but when we come to action we ought to erect  our minds and to make our enemies be they ever so wicked  believe that neither any human no nor any providential  misfortune can evef depress the courage of Jews while they  are alive  nor will any of them ever overlook an Arabian  or suffer such an one to become lord of his good things whom  he has in a manner taken captive and that many times also  And do not you disturb yourselves at the quaking of inani  mate creatures nor do you imagine that this earthquake is  another sign of another calamity for such affections of the  elements are according to the course af nature nor does it  import any thing farther to men than what mischief it does  immediately of itself Perhaps there may come some short  sign before hand in the case of pestilences and famines and  earthquakes  but these calamities themselves have their  force Chap XIX WARS OF THE JEWS 3O7  force limited by themselves without foreboding any other  calamity And indeed what greater mischief can the war  though it should be a violent one do to us than the earth  quake hath done  Nay there is a signal of our enemies de   struction visible and that a very great one also and this is  not a natural one nor derived from the hand of foreigners  neither but it is this that they have barbarously murdered  our ambassadors contrary to the common law of mankind   and they have destroyed so many as if they esteemed them  sacrifices for God in relation to this war But they will  not avoid his great eye nor his invincible right hand and we  snail be revenged of them presently in case we still retain  any of the courage of our forefathers and rise up boldly to  punish these covenant breakers Let every one therefore go  on and fight not so much for his wife or his children or for  the danger his country is in as for these ambassadors of ours  those dead ambassadors will conduct this war of ours better  than we ourselves who are alive And if yoil will be ruled  by me I will myself go before you into danger  for yon  know this well enough that your courage is irresistible unless  you hurt yourselves by acting rashly  5 When Herod had encouraged them by this speech and he saw with what alacrity they went he offered sacrifice to God and after that sacrifice he passed over the river Jordan with his army and pitched his camp about Philadelphia near the enemy and about a fortification that lay between them He then shot  at them at a distance and was desirous to come to an cngage ment presently  for some of them had been sent beforehand to seize upon that fortification  but the king sent some who im mediately beat them out of he fortification while he himself went in the forefront of the army which he put in battle array every day and invited the Arabians to fight But as none ot them came out of their camp for they were in a terrible fright and their general Elthemus was not able to say a word for fear so Herod came upon them and pulled their fortification to pieces by which means they were compelled to come out to fight which they did in disorder and so that the horsemen and foot men were mixed together They were indeed superior to the Jews in number but inferior to their alacrity although they were obliged to expose themselves to danger by their very despair of victory â  6 Now  This speech of Herod is set down twice by Josephus here and Antiq B XV ch v sect 3 Vol II to the very came purpose but by no means in the same words whence it appears that the sense WES Herod s but the composition Josephus s QJ12 SO WARS OF THE JEWS Book I 0 Now while they made opposition they had not a great number slain  but as soon as they turned their backs a great many were trodden to pieces by the Jews and a great many by themselves and so perished tilf five thousand were fallen down dead in their flight wliile the rest of the multitude prevented their immediate death by crowding into the fortification He rod encompassed these round and besieged them and while they were ready to be takenby their enemies in arms they had another additional distress upon them which was thirst and want of water for the king was above hearkening to their ambassa dors and when they offered five hundred talents as the price of their redemption he pressed still harder upon them And as they were burnt up by their thirst they came out and volun tarily delivered themselves up by multitudes to the Jews till ia five days time four thousand of them were put into bonds  and on the sixth d y the multitude that were left despaired of saving themselves and came out to fight with these Herod fought and slew again about seven thousand insomuch that he punished Aribia so severely and so far extinguished the spirits of the men that he was chosen by the nation for their ruler  Â CHAP XX Herod is confirmed In his kingdom by Ccesar and cultivates a friendship with the emperor by magnificent presents  while Caesar returns bis kindness by bestowing on him that part of his kingdom which had bten taken away from it by Cleopatra ivith the addition of Zenodorus s country also Â 1 T UT now Herod was under immediate concern about U a most important affair on account of his friendship with Antony who was already overcome at Actium by Caesar  yet he was more afraid than hurt for Caesar did not think he had quite undone Antony while Herod continued his assistance to him However the king resolved to expose himself to dan gers  accordingly he sailed to Rhodes where Caesar then abode and came to him without his diadem and in the habit and ap pearance of a private person but in his behaviour as a king So he concealed nothing of the truth but spake thus before his face   O Caesar as I was ma de king of the Jews by Antony e so do I profess that 1 have used my royal authority in the best  manner and entirely for his advantage  nor will I conceal  this farther that thou hadst certainly found me in arms and  an inseparable companion of his had not the Arabians hin  dered me However 1 sent him as many auxiliaries as I  was able and many tea thqusand cori of corn Nay inr  Chap XX WARS OF THE JEWS 309  deed I did not desert my benefactor after the blow that was  given him at Actium but I gave him the best advice 1 was  able when I was no longer able to assist him in the war and  I told him that there was but one way of recovering his affairs  and that was to kill Cleopatra and I promised him that it  she were once dead I would afford him money and walls for  his security with an army and myself to assist him in his  war against thee but his affections for Cleopatra stopped his  ears as did God himself also who hath bestowed the govern  ment on thee I own myself also to be overcome together with  him and with this last fortune I have laid aside my diadem  and am come hither to thee having my hopes of safety in thy u virtue and I desire that thou wilt first consider how faithful  a friend and not whose friend I have been 2 Caesar replied to him thus  Nay thou shalt not only be  in safety but shalt be a king and that more firmly than thou  wert before for thou art worthy to reign over a great ma  ny subjects by reason of the fastness of thy friendship  and  do thou endeavour to be equally constant in thy friendship to  me upon my good success which is what 1 depend upon from  the generosity of thy disposition However Antony hath  done well in preferring Cleopatra to thee for by this means  we have gained thee by her madness and thus thou hast be  gun to be my friend before I began to be thine on which ac  count Quintus Dedius hath written to me that thou sentest  him assistance against the gladiators I do therefore assure  thee that I will confirm the kingdom to thee by decree I  shall also endeavour to do thee some farther kindness here  after that thou mayest find no loss in the want of Antony 3 When Caesar had spoken such obliging things to the king and had put the diadem again about his head he proclaimed what he had bestowed on him by a decree in which he enlarged in the commendation of the man after a magnificent manner Whereupon He rod obliged him to be kind to him by the presents he gave him and he desired him to forgive Alexander one of Antony s friends who was become a supplicant to him But Caesar s anger against him prevailed and he complained of the many and very great offences the man whom he petitioned for had been guilty of and by what means he rejected his petition After this Caesar went for Egypt through Syria when Herod received him with royal and rich entertainments and then did he first of all ride along with Ceesar as he was reviewing his army about Ptolemais and feasted him with all his friends and then distributed among the rest of the army what was necessary to feast them withal He also made a plentiful provision ofwa   I ll â        â f â â â â  â â â â    tâ 310 Book I WARS OF THE JEWS rer for them when they were to march as far as Pelusium through a dry country which he did also in like manner at their return thence nor were there any necessaries wanting to that army It was therefore the opinion both of Caesar and of his soldiers that Herod s kingdom was too small for those generous presentshe made them for which reason when Caesar was come into Egypt and Cleopatra and Antony were dead he did not only bestow other marks of honour upon him but made an ad dition to his kingdom by giving him not only the country which had been taken from him by Cleopatra but besides that Gada ra and Hippos and Samaria and moreover of the maritime cities  Gaza and Anthedon and Joppn and Strato s Tower He also made him a present of four hundred Galls Galatians as a guard for his body which they had been to Cleopatra be fore Nor did any thing so strongly induce Caesar to make these presents as the generosity of him that received them 4 Moreover after the first games at Actium he added to his kingdom both the region called Trachonitis and what lay in its neighbourhood Batanea and the country of Auranitis and that on the following occasion Zenodoru3 who had hired the house of Lysanias had all along sent robbersout of Trachonitis among the Damascens who thereupon had recourse to Varro the president of Syria and desired of him thathe would representthe calamity they were in to Caesar when Caesar was acquainted with it he sent back orders that this nest of robbers should be destroyed Varro therefore made an expedition against them and cleared the land of those men and took it away from Zeno dorus Caesar did also afterward bestow it on Herod that it might not again become a receptacle for those robbers that had come against Damascus He also made him a procurator of all Syria and this on the tenth year afterward when he came a gain into that province and this was so established that the other procurators could not do any thing in the administration without his advice but when Zenodorus was dead Caesar be stowed on him all that land which lay between Trachonitis and Galilee Yet what was still of more consequence to Herod he was beloved by Caesar next after Agrippa and by Agrippa next after Caesar whence he arrived at a very great degree of feli city Yet did the greatness of his soul exceed it and the main part  Since Josephus both here and in his Antiq B XV ch vii sect 3 Vol II reckons G iza which had been a free city among the cities given Herod by Au gustus and yet implies that Herod had made Costobarus a governor of it before Antiq B XV ch viil sect 9 Harduin has some

cities that were built by Herod and erected from the very foundations as also of those other ed if ces that were erected by him and what kiagnificence he shewed to fo reigners  and how fortune was in all things favourable to him J 1 A CCORDINGLY in the sixteenth year of his reign JT Herod rebuilt the temple and encompassed a piece of land about it with a wall which land was twice as large as that before inclosed The expences he laid out upon it were vastly large also and the riches about it were unspeakable A sign of which you have in the great cloisters that were erected about the temple and thecitadel which was on its north side The cloisters he built from the foundation but the citadel he repaired at a vast expence nor was it other than a royal palace which he called jtntonia in honour of Antony He also built himself a palace in the upper city containing two very large and most beautiful apartments To which the holy house itself could not be com pared in largeness The one apartment he named Ctesarevm and the other Agrippiwn from his two great friends   2 Yet did he not preserve their memory by particular build ings only with their names given them but his generosity went as far as entire cities for when he had built a most beautiful wall round a country in Samaria twenty furlongs long and had brought six thousand inhabitants into it and had allotted to it a most fruitful piece of land and in the midst of this city thus built had erected a very large temple to Caesar and had laid round about it a portion of sacred land of three furlongs and an half he called the city Sebaste from Sebastus or Augustus and settled the affairs of the city after a most regular manner 3 And when Caesar had further bestowed upon him another additional country he built there also a temple of white marble hard by the fountains of Jordan the place is called Panium where is a top of a mountain that is raised to an immense height and at its side beneath or at its bottom a dark cave opens itself within which there is an horrible precipice that descends abrupt ly to a vast depth it contains a mighty quantity of water which is  This fort was first built as it is supposed by John Hyrcanus See Prid at the year 107 and called Saris the tower or citadel It was afterwards rebuilr with great improvements by Herod under the government of Antonius and wai named from him the Tower efAnttmia and about the time when Herod rebuilt the temple he seems to have put his last hand to it See Antiq B XVIII ch v Â ect 4 voL III Of the war B I ch iii sect 4 It lay on the north west side of the temple and was a quarter as large  312 WARS OF THE JE1V9 Book I is immoveable and when any body lets down any thing to mea sure the depth of the earth beneath the water no length of cord is sufficient to reach it Now the fountains of Jordan rise at the joots of this cavity outwardly and as some think this is the utmost origin of Jordan but we shall speak of that matter more accurately in our following history 4 But the king erected other places at Jericho also between the citadel Cyprbs and the former palace such as were better and more useful than the former for travellers and named them from the same friends of his To say all at once there was not any place of his kingdom fit for the purpose that was permitted to be without somewhat that was for Caesar s honour and when he had filled his own country with temples he poured out the like plentiful marks of his esteem into his province and built many cities which he called Cesareas   _ 5 And when he observed that there was a city by the sea side that was much decayed its name was Strata s Tower but that the place by the happiness of its situation was capable of great improvements from his liberality he rebuilt it all with white 6tone and adorned it with several most splendid palaces wherein he especially demonstrated his magnanimity  for the case was this that all the sea shore between Dora and Joppa in the mid dle between which this city is situated had no good haven in somuch that every o ie that sailed from Pheniciafor Egypt was obliged to lie in the stormy sea by reason of the south winds that threatened them which wind if it blew but a little fresh such vast waves are raised and dash upon the rocks that upon their retreat the sea is in a great ferment for a long way But the king by the expences he was at and the liberal disposal of them overcame nature and built an haven larger than was the Pyree um  at Athens and in the other retirements of the water he built other deep stations for the ships also 6 Now although the place where he built was greatly oppo sitetohis purposes yet did he so fully struggle with that difficul ty that the firmness of his building could not easily be conquer ed by the sea  and the beauty and ornament of the works was such as though he had not had any difficulty in the operation for when he had measured out asl irge a space as we have before mentioned he let down stones into twenty fathom water the great est part of which were fity feet in length and nine in depth and ten  That Joscphus speaks troth when he assures us that  the haven of this Ce  sarea was made byi Herod not less nay rather largefythan that famous haven at  Athens called the Pytcum will appear says Dean Aldrich to him who com pares the descriptions of that at Athens in Thucydides Â nd Pausanias with this of Ctsarea in Jo ephus here and in the Antiq B XV ch is stct 6 Vol II and B XVU eh ix jsect  vol lit â  Chap XXI WARS OF THE JEWS 313 ten in breadth and some still larger But when the haven was filled up to that depth he enlarged that wall which was thus al ready extant above the sea till it was two hundred feet wide  one hundred of which had buildings before it in order to break the force of the waves whence it was called Procumasia or the first breaker of the waves but the rest of the space was under a stone wall that ran round it On this wall were very large towers the principal and most beautiful of which was called Drusium from Drusus who was son in law to Caesar 7 There was also a great number of arches where the mari ners dwelt and all the places before them round about was a large valley or walk for a key for landing place to those that came on shore but the entrance was en the north because the north wind was there the most gentle of all the winds At the mouth of the haven were on each side three great Colossi sup ported by pillars where thoseCollossi that arejonyour left hand as you sail into the port are supported by a solid tower but those on the right hand are supported by two upright stones joined together which stones were larger than that tower which was on the ether side of the entrance Now there were con tinual edifices joined to the haven which were also themselves of white stone and to this haven did the narrow streets of the city lead and were built at equal distances one from anotheq And over against the mouth of the haven upon an elevation there was a temple for Caesar which was excellent both in beau ty and largeness and therein was a Colossus of Caesar not less than that of Jupiter Olympius which it was made to resemble The other Colossus of Rome was equal to that of Juno at Argos So he dedicated the city to the province and the haven to the sailors there but the honour of the building he ascribed to  Caesar and named it Cesarea accordingly 8 He also built the other edifices the amphitheatre and thea tre and market place in a manner agreeable to that denomina tion and appointed games every fifth year and called them in like manner Cedar s Games and he first himself proposed the largestprizes upon the hundred ninty secondOlympiad in which not only the victors themselves but those thatcamenext to them and even those that came in the third place were partakers of his royal bounty He also rebuilt Anthedon a city that lay on the coast and had been demolished in the wars and named it Agrippeum Â These buildingÂ of cities by the name of Cssar and institution of solemn game in honour of Augustus Cassar as here and in the antiquities related of Her rod by Josephus the Roman historians atteit to as things then frequent in the provinces of that empire as Dean Aldrich observes on this chapter VOL III R r 314 WARS OF THE JEWS  Book I Agrippeum Moreover he had so very great a kindness for his friend Agrippa that he had his name engraved upon that gate which he had himself erected in the temple 9 Herod was also a lover of his father if any other person ever was s o for he made a monument for his father even that city which he built in the finest plain that was in his kingdom and whicli had rivers and trees in abundance and named it Anti patris He also built a wall about a citadel that lay above Je richo and was a very strong and very fine building and dedi cated it to his mother and called it Cypros Moreover he dedi cated a tower that was at Jerusalem and called it by the name of his brother Phasaelus whose structure largeness and mag nificence we shall describe hereafter He also built another city in the valley that leads northward from Jericho and named it Phasaelis 10 And as he transmitted to eternity his family and friends so did he not neglect a memorial for himself but built a fortress upon a mountain towards Arabia and named it from himself  Jferodiums and he called that hill that was the shape of a woman s breast and was sixty furlongs distant from Jerusalem by the same name He also bestowed much curious art upom it with great ambition and built round towers all about the top of it and filled up the remaining space with the most costly pa laces round about insomuch that not only the sight of the in ner apartments was splendid but great wealth was laid out on the outward walls and partitions and roofs also Besides this he brought a mighty quantity of water from a great distance and at vast charges and raised an ascent to it of two hundred steps of the whitest marble for the hill was itself moderately high and entirely factitious He also built other palaces about the roots of the hill sufficient to receive the furniture that was put into them with his friends also insomuch that on account of its containing all necessaries the fortress might seem to be a city but by the bounds it had a palace only Jl And when heliad built so much he shewed the greatness of his soul to no small number of foreign cities He built places for exercise at Tripoli and Damascus and Ptolemais he built a wall about Byblus as also large rooms and cloisters and temples and market places at Berytus and Tyre with theatres at Sidpn and Damascus He also built aqueducts for those  TherÂ were two cities or citadels called Herodiums in Judea and both men tioned by Josephus not only here but Antiq B XIV ch xiii sect 9 6 XV ch ix sect 6 Vol II Of the War B I chap xiii sect 8 B III ch iii sect J One of them wai ioo and the other 60 furlongs distant from Jerusalem One of them is mentioned by Pliny Hist Nat B V chap xiv as Dean Aldrich observes here Chap XXI WARS OF THJE JEWS 15 those Laodiceans who lived by the sea side and for those of Ascalon he built baths and costly fountains as also cloisters round a court that were admirable both for their workman ship and largeness Moreover he dedicated groves and meadows to some people nay not a few cities there were who had lands of his donation as if they were parts of his own kingdom He also bestowed annual revenues and those for ever also on the settlements for exercises and appointed for them as well as for the people of Cos that such rewards should never be wanting He also gave corn to all such as wanted it and conferred upon Rhodes large sums of money for building ships and this he did in many places and frequently also And when Apollo s temple had been burnt down he rebuilt it at his own charges after a better manner than it was before What need I speak of the presents he made to the Lycians and Samnians  or of his great liberality through all Ionia and that according to every body s wants of them And are not the Athenians and Lace demonians and Nicopolitans and that Pergamus which is in Mysia full of donations that Herod presented them withal And as for that large open place belonging to Antioch in Syria did not he pave it with polished marble though it were twenty fur longs long and this when it was shunned by all men before because it was full of dirt and filthiness when he besides adorn ed the same place with a cloister of the same length 12 It is true a man may say these were favours peculiar to those particular places on which he bestowed his benefits but then what favours he bestowed on the Eleans was a donation not only in common to all Greece but to all the habitable earth as far as the glory of the Olympic games reached For when he perceived that they were come to nothing for want of money and that the only remains of ancient Greece were in a manner gone he not only became one of the combatants in that return of the fifth year games which in his sailing to Rome he hap pened to be present at but he settled upon them revenues of money for perpetuity insomuch that his memorial as a com batant there can rrever fail It would be an infinite task if I should go over his payments of people s debts or tributes for them as he eased the people of Phasaelus of Batanea and of the small cities about Cilicia of those annual pensions they before paid However the fear he was in much disturbed the great ness of his soul lest he should be exposed to envy or seem to hunt after greater things than he ought while he bestowed more liberal gifts upon these cities than did their owners themselves 13 Now Herod had a body suited to his soul and was  R r 2  ever WARS OF THÂ JEWS Book I ever a most excellent hunter where he generally had good suc cess by the means of his great skill in riding horses for in one day he caught forty wild beasts  that country breeds also bears and the greatest part of it is replenished with stags and wild asses He was also such a warrior as could not be with stood many men therefore there are who have stood amazed at ai readiness in his exercises when tbey saw him throw the javelin directly forward and to shoot the arrow upon the mark And then besides these performances of his depending on his own strength of mind and body fortune was also very favour able to him for he seldom failed of success in his wars and when he failed he was not himself the occasion of such failings but he either was betrayed by some or the rashness of his own soldiers procured his defeat   GHAP XXII The Murder of Ar ntohuhts and Hyrcanvt the high priest as also of Mariamne the queen i i YTCfWEVER fortune was avenged on Herod in his _Ll eternal great successes by raising him up domestical troubles and he began to have wild disorders in his family on account of his wife of whom he was so very fond For when he came to the government he sent away her whom he had be fore married when he was a private person and who was born at Jerusalem whose name was Doris and married Mariamne the daughter of Alexander the son of Aristobulus on whose account disturbances arose in his family and that in part very soon but chiefly after his return from Rome For first of all he expelled Antipater the son of Doris for the sake of his sons by Mariamne out of the city and permitted him to come thither at no other times than at the festivals After this he slew his wife s grandfather Hyrcanus when he was returned out of Par thia to him under this pretence that he suspected him of plot ting against him Now this Hyrcanus had been carried captive to Barzapharnes when he over ran Syria but those of his own country beyond Euphrates were desirous he would stay with them and this out of the commiseration they had for his condi tion  and had he complied with their desires when they exhort ed him not to go over the river to Herod he had not perished  but themarriage of his grand daughter to Herod was his tempt ation  for as he relied upon him and was over fond of his own coun    tT7r â Here seems to be a small defect in the copies which describe the wild beasw which were hunted in a certain country by Hired without noising any such coun try at all r 1 Chap XXII WARS OF THE JEWS 317 try he came back to it Herod s provocation was this not that Hyrcanus made any attempt to gain the kingdom but that it was fitter for him to be their king than for Herod  2 Now of the five children which Herod had by Mariamtw two of them were daughters and three were sons and the young est of these sons was educated at Rome and there died but the two eldest he treated as those of royal blood on account of the nobility of their mother and because they wÂ re not born till he was king But then what was stronger than all this was the love that he bare to Mariamne and which inftamed him every day to a great degree and so far conspired with the other mo tives that he felt no other troubles on account of her he loved so entirely But Mariarane s hatred to him was not inferior to his love to her She had indeed but too just a cause of indigna tion from what he had done while her boldness proceeded from his affection to her so she openly reproached him with what he had done to her grandfather Hyrcaaus and to her brother A ristobulus for he had not spared this Aristobulus though he were but a child for when he had given him the high priest hood at the age of seventeen he slew him quickly after he had conferred that dignity upon him but when Aristobulus had pÂ t on the holy vestments and had approached to the altar at a festi val the multitude in great crowds fell into tears whereupon the child was sÂ nt by night to Jericho and was there dipped by the Gall at Herod s command in a pool till be was drowned 3 For these reasons Mariamne reproached Herod and his sister and mother after a most contumelious manner while he was dumb on account of his affection for her yet had the wo men great indignation at her and raised a calumny against her that she was false to his bed which thing they thought most likely to move Herod to anger They also contrived to have many other circumstances believed in order to make the thing more credible and accused her of having sent her picture into Egypt to Antony and that her lust was so extravagant as to have thus shewed herself though she was absent to a man that ran mad after women and to a man that had it in his power to use violence to her This charge fell like a thunderbolt upon He rod and put him into disorder and that especially because his love to her occasioned him to be jealous and because he consi dered with himself that Cleopatra was a shrewd woman and that on her account Lysanias the king was taken off as well as Malichus the Arabian for his fear did not only extend to the dissolving of his marriage but to the danger of his life 4 When th refore he was about to take a journey abroad he committed his wife to Joseph his sister SalotBe s husband as to 818 WARS oF THE JEWS Book I to one who would be faithful to him and bare him good will on account of their kindred  he also gave him a secret injunction that if Antony slew him he would slay her But Joseph with out any ill design and only in order to demonstrate the king s love to his wife how he could not bear to think of being separa ted from her even by death itself he discovered this grand se cret to her  upon which when Herod was come back and as they talked together confirmed his love to her by many oaths and assured her that he had never such an affection for any other woman as he had for her   Yes says she thou didst to be  sure demonstrate thy love to me by the injunctions thou gavest  Joseph when thou commandedst him to kill me 5 When he heard that this grand secret was discovered he was like a distracted man and said that Joseph would never have disclosed that injunction of his unless he had debauched her His passion also made him stark mad and leaping out of his bed he ran about the palace after a wild manner at which time his sister Salome took the opportunity also to blast her reputation and confirmed his suspicion about Joseph whereupon out of his ungovernable jealousy and rage he commanded both of them to be slain immediately but as soon as ever his passion was over he repented of what he had done and as soon as his anger was worn off his affections were kindled again And indeed the flame of his desires for her was so ardent that he could not think she was dead but would appear under his disorders to speak to her as if she were still alive till he were better instructed by time when his grief and trouble now she was dead appeared as great as his affection had been for her while she was living CHAP XXIII Calumnies against the sons of Marianne Antipater is prefer red before them They are accused before Ccesar and Herod is reconciled to them Â 2 TOW Mariamne s sons were heirs to that hatred which _L had been borne their mother and when they consider ed the greatness of Herod s crime towards her they were suspi cious of him as of an enemy of theirs and this first while they were educated at Rome but still more when they were returned to Judea This temper of theirs increased upon them as they grew  Here is either a defect or a great mistake in Josephus s pretest copies or memory for Mariamne did uot i ow reproach Herod with this his first injunction to Joseph to k l her if he himself were slain by Antony but that he had given the

an age fit for marriage the one of them married their aunt Salome s daughter which Salome had been the accuser of their mother t ie other married the daughter of Archelaus king of Cappadocia And now they used boldness in speaking as well as bore hatred in their minds Now those that calumniated them took a handle from such their boldness and certain of them spake now more plainly to the king that there were treacherous designs laid against him by both his sons and he that was son in law to Archelaus relying upon his father in law was preparing to fly away in order to accuse Herod before Caesar and when Herod s head had beenlong enough filled with these calumnies hebroughtAntipater whom he had by Doris into favour again as a defence to him against his other sons and began all the ways he possibly could to prefer him before them 2 But these sons were not able to bear this change in their af fairs but when they saw him that was born of a mother of no family the nobility of their birth made them unable to contain their indignation but whensoever they were uneasy they shew ed the anger they had at it And as these sons did day after day inprove in thattheiranger Antipateralreadyexercisedallhisown abilities which were very great in flattering his father and in contrivingmany sorts of calumnies against his brethren while he told some stories of them himself and put it upon other proper persons to raise other stories against them till at length he entire ly cut his brethern off from all hopes of succeeding to the king dom  for he was already publicly put into his father s will as his successor Accordingly he was sent with royal ornaments and other marks of royalty to Caesar excepting the diadem He was also able in time to introduce his mother again into Mar riamne s bed The two sorts of weapons he made use of against his brethern were flattery and calumny whereby be brought matters privately to such a pass that the king had thoughts of putting his sons to death 3 So the father drew Alexander as far as Rome and charged him with an attempt of poisoning him before Caesar Alexander could hardly speak for lamentation but having a judge that was more skilful than Antipater and more wise than Herod hemodest ly avoided laying any imputation upon his father but with great strength of reason confuted the calumnies laid against him and when he had demonstrated the innocencyof his brother who was in the like danger with himself he at last bewailed the craftiness of Antipater and the disgrace they were under He was enabled also to justify himself not only by a clear conscience which he carried with him but by his eloquence for he was a shrewd man 32P WARS or THE jews Book I man in making speeches And upon his saying at last that if bis father objected this crime to them it was in his power to put  them to death he made all the audience weep and he brought Caesar to that pass as to reject the accusations and to reconcile their father to them immediately But the conditions of their reconciliation were these that they should in all things be obe dient to their father and that he should have power to leave the kingdom to which of them he pleased 4 After this the king came back from Rome and seemed to have forgiven his sons upon these accusations but still so that he was not without his suspicions of them They were follow ed by Antipater who was the fountain head of those accusa tions  yet did not he openly discover his hatred to them as re vering him that had reconciled them But as Herod sailed by Cilicia he touched at  Eleusa where Archelaus treated them in the mostobligingmanner andgave him thanks for thedeliver ance of his son in law and was much pleased at their reconcilia tion  and this the more because he had formerly written to his friends at Rome that they should be assisting to Alexander at his trial So he conducted Herod as far as Zephyrium and made him presents to the value of thirty talents 5 Now when Herod was come to Jerusalem he gathered the people together and presented to them his three sons and gave them an apologetic account of his absence and  thanked God  greatly and thanked Caesar greatly also for settling his house  when it was under disturbances and had procured concord  among his sons whichwas of greater consequence than the king  dom itself and which I will render still more firm for Caesar  hath put into my power to dispose of the government and to  appoint my successor Accordingly in way of requittal for  his kindness and in order to provide for mine own advantage  I do declare that these three sons of mine shall be kings And  in the first place I pray for the approbation of God to what  I am about and in the next place  desire your approbation  also The age of one of them and the nobility of the other  two shall procure them the succession Nay indeed my king  dom is so large that it may be sufficient for more kings  Now do you keep those in their places

converse will produce u quarrels and contentions among them but that if these with  whom they converse be of good tempers they will preserve  their natural affections for one another But still I desire  that not these only but all the captains of my army have for  the present their hopss placed on me alone for I do not give  away my kingdom to these my sons but give them royal hon  ours only whereby it will come to pass that they will en  joy the sweet parts of government as rulers themselves but  that the burden of administration will rest upon myself  whether I will or not And let every

might take effect accordingly but for those who wished for a change of affairs they pretended they did not so much as hear what he said CHAP XXIV The mahce of Antipater and Doris Alexander is very uneasy on Glaphyrd s account Herod pardons Pberoras whom he suspected and Salome vihom be knew to make mischief among them Herod s eunuchs are tortured and Alexander is bound j 1 TQUT now the quarrel that was between them still ac L companied these brethren when they parted and the suspicions they had one of the other grew worse Alexander and Aristobulus were much grieved that the privilege of the first born was confirmed to Antipater as was Antipater very angry at his brethren that they were to succeed him But then this last being of a disposition that was mutable and politic he l iev how to hold his tongue and used a great deal of cunning and thereby concealed the hatred he bore to them while the former depending on the nobility of their births had el ery thing upon their tongues which was in their minds Many also there nvere who provoked them farther and many of their seeming friends insinuated themselves into their acquaintance to spy out what they did Now every thing that was said by Alexander was presently brought to Antipater and from Anti pater it was brought to Herod with additions Nor could the young man say any thing in the simplicity of his heart with out giving offence but what he said was still turned to calumny against him And if he had been at any time a little free in his conversation great imputations were forged from the smallest occasions Antipater also was perpetually setting some to pro voke him to speak that the lies he raised of him might seem to have some foundation of truth and if among the many stories that were given out but one of them could be proved true that was supposed to imply the rest to be true also And as to An tipater s friends they were all either naturally so cautious in speaking or had been so far bribed to conceal their thoughts that nothing of these grand secrets got abroad by their means Nor should one be mistaken if he called the life of Antipater a mystery of wickedness for he either corrupted Alexander s ac quaintance with money or got into their favour by flatteries by which two means he gained all his designs and brought them to betray their master and to steal away and reveal what he either did or said Thus did he act a part very cunningly in all points Chap XXIV WARS OF THE JEWS 323 points and wrought himself a passage by his calumnies with the greatest shrewdness while he put on a face as if he were a kind brother to Alexander and Aristobuliis but suborned other men to inform of what they did td Herod And when any thing was told against Alexander he would come in and pretend to be of his side and would begin to contradict what was said but would afterward contrive matters so privately that the king should have an indignation at him His general aim was this to lay a plot and to make it believed that Alexander lay in wait to kill his father  for nothing afforded so great a Confirmation to these calumnies as did Antipater s apologies for him 2 By these methods Herod was inflamed and as much as his natural affection to the young men did every day diminish so much did it increase towards Antipater The Courtiers also inclined to the same conduct some of their own accord and others by the king s injunction as particularly did Ptolemy  the king s dearest friend as also the king s brethern and all his children  for Antipater was all in all and what was the bit terest part of all to Alexander Antipater s mother was also all in all she was one that gave counsel against them and Was more harsh than a stepmother and one that hated the queen s sons more than is usual to hate sons in law All men did therefore already pay their respects to Antipater in hopes of advantage and it was the king s command whieh alienated every body from the brethren he having given this charge to his most intimate friends that they should not come near nor pay any regard to Alexander or to his friends Herod was also become terrible not only to his domestics about the court but to his friends abroad for Caesar had given such a privilege td no other king as he had given to him which was this that he might fetch back any one that fled from him even out of a city that was not under his own jurisdiction Now the young men were not acquainted with the calumnies raised against them  fot1 which reason they could not guard themselves against them but fell under them for their father did not make any publie com plaints against either of them though in a little time they per ceived how things were by his coldness to them and by the great uneasiness he shewed upon any thing that troubled him Antipater had also made their uncle Pheroras to be their enemy as well as their aunt Salome while he was always talking with her as with a wife and irritating her against them Moreover Alexander s wife Glaphyra augmented this hatred against them by deriving her nobility and genealogy from great per sons and pretending that she was a lady superior to all others in that kingdom as being derived by her father s side from S s 2 Temenus 32 Boot I WARS Â T THE JEWS Temenus and by her mother s side from D arius the son of Hystaspes She also frequently reproached Herod s sister and wives with the ignobility of their descent and that they werer every one chosen by him for their beauty but not for their fa mily Now those wives of his were not a few it being of old permitted to the Jews to  marry many wives t and this king delighting in many all which hated Alexander on account of Glaphyra s boasting and reproaches 3 Nay Aristobulus had raised a quarrel between himself and Salome who was his mother in law besides the anger he had conceived at Glaphyra s reproaches T for he perpetually up braided bis wife with the meanness of her family and com plained that as he had married a woman of a low family so had his brother Alexander married one of royal blood At this Salome s daughter wept and told it her with this addition that Alexander threatened the mothers of his other brethren that when he should come to the crown he would make them weave with their maideps and would make those brothers of his coun try schoolmasters and brake this jest upon them that they had been very carefully instructed to fit them for such an em ployment Hereupon Salome could not contain her anger but told all to Herod nor could her testimony be suspected since it was against her own son in law There was also another ca lumny that ran abroad and inflamed the king s mind for he heard that these sons of his were perpetually speaking of their mother and among their lamentations for her did not abstain from cursing him and tha t when he made presents of any of Mammae s garments to his later wives these threatened that in a little time instead of royal garments they would clothe them in no better than hair cloth 4 Now upon these accounts though Herod was somewhat afraid of the young men s high spirit yet did he not despair of reducing them to a better mind but before he went to Rome whether he was now going by sea he called them to him and partly threatened them a little as a king but for the main he admonished them as a father and exorted them to love their breihren and told them that he would pardon their former of fences â That it was an immemorial custom among the Jews and their forefathers the patriarchs to have sometimes more wires or wives and concubines than one at the same time and that this polygamy was not directly forbidden in the law of Moses is eÂ ident but that ptlygamy was ever properly and distinctly permitted in that law of Moses in the places here cite d by Dean Aldrich Deut xvii 16 17 or xxi 15 or indeed any where else does not appesr to me And what our Sa viour says about the common Jewish divorces which may lay much greater claim to such a permission than ptlygaay seems to me true in this case also that Moses for the hardness of their hearts suffered them to have several wives at the same time but that  from the beginning it was not so Matt xix 8 Mark x 5  Chap XXIV WARS or THE JEWS  fences if they would amend for the time to come But they refuted the calumnies that had been raised of them and said they were false and alleged that their actions were sufficient for their vindication and said withal that he himself ought to shut his ears against such tales and not to be too easy in believing them for that there would never be wanting those that would tell lies to their disadvantage as long as any would give ear to them 5 When they had thus soon pacified him as being their fa ther they got clear of the present fear they were in Yet did they see occasion for sorrow in some time afterward for they knew that Salome as well as their uncle Pheroras were their enemies who were both of them heavy and severe persons and especially Pheroras who was a partner with Herod in all the af fairs of the kingdom excepting his diadem He had also an hundred talents of his own revenue and enjoyed the advantage of all the land beyond Jordan which he had received as a gift from his brother who had asked of Caesar to make him a te trarch as he was made accordingly Herod had also given him a wife out of the royal family who was no other than his owa wife s sister and after her death had solemnly espoused to him his own eldest daughter with a dowry of three hundred talents  but Pheroras refused to consummate this royal marriage out of his affection to a maid servant of his Upon whkh account Herod was very angry and gave that daughter in marriage to a brother s son of his Joseph who was slain afterward by the Parthians but in some time he laid aside his anger against Phe roras and pardoned him as one cot able to overcome his fool ish passion for the maid servant 6 Nay Pheroras had been accused long before while the queen Mariamne was alive as if he were in a plot to poison Herod and there came then so great a number of informers that Herod himself though he was an exceeding lover of hia brethren was brought to believe what was said and to be afraid of it also and when he had brought many of those that were under suspicion to the torture he came at last to Pheroras sown friends none of which did openly confess the crime but they owned that he had made preparation to take her whom he loved and ran away to the Parthians Costobarus also the husband of Salome to whom the king had given her in marriage after her former husband had been put to death for adultery was instru mental in bringing about this contrivance and flight of his Nor did Salome escape all calumny upon herself for her brother Pheroras accused her that she had made an agreement to marry Silleus the procurator of Obodas king of Arabia who was at bitter enmity with Herod but when she was convicted of this and 328  WARS OF THE JEWS Book I and of all that Pheroras had accused her of she obtained her par don The king also pardoned Pheroras himself the crimes he had been accused of 7 But the storm of the whole family was removed to Alexan der and all of ic rested upon his head There were three eunuchs who were in the highest esteem with the king as was plain by the offices they were in about him for one of them was ap pointed to be his butler another of them got his supper ready for him and the third put him into bed and lay down by him Now Alexander had prevailed with these men by large gifts to let him use them after an obscene manner which when it was told to the king they were tortured and found guilty and presently confessed the criminal conversation he had with them They also discovered the promises by which they were induced so to do and how they were deluded by Alexander who had told them That  they ought not to fix their hopes upon He  rod an old man and one so shameless as to colour his hair  unless they thought that would make him young again but  that they ought to fix their attention to him who was to be his  successor in the kingdom whether he would or not and who  in no long time would avenge himself on his enemies and  make his friends happy and blessed and themselves in the first  place that the men of power did already pay respects to  Alexander privately and that the captains of the soldiery and  the officers did secretly come to him   8 These confessions did so terrify Herod that he durst not immediately publish them but he sent spies abroad privately by night and by day who should make a close inquiry after ail that was done and said and when any were but suspected of treason he put them to death insomuch that the palace was full of horriblyunjust proceedings for everybody forged calumnies as they were themselves in a state of enmity or hatred against others and many there were who abused the king s bloody passion to the disadvantage of those with whom they had quar rels and lies were easily believed and punishments were inflic ted sooner than the calumnies were forged he who had just then been accusing another was accused himself and was led away to execution together with him whom he had convicted for the danger the king was in of his life made examinations be very short He also proceeded to such a degree of bitterness that he could not look on any of those that were not accused with a pleasant countenance but was in the most barbarous disposition towards his own friends Accordingly he forbade a great many of them to come to court and to those whom he had not power to punish actually he spake harshly but for Anti pater 6hap XXV WARS OF THE JEWS 327 pater Jie insulted Alexander now he was under his misfortunes and got a stout company of his kindred together and raised all sorts of calumny against him and for the king he was brought to such a degree of terror by those prodigious slanders and con trivances that Tie fancied he saw Alexander coming to him with a drawn sword in his hand so he caused him to be seized up on immediately and bound and fell to examining his friends by torture many of whom died under the torture but would discover nothing aor say any thing against their consciences but some of them being forced to speak falsely by the pains they endured said that Alexander and his brother Aristobulus plotted against him and waited for an opportunity to kill him as he was hunting and then fly away to Rome These acci  sations though they were of an incredible nature and only framed upon the great distress they were in were readily be lieved by the king who thought it some comfort to him after he had bound his son that it might appear he had not dqne it unjustly  CHAP XXV Archelaus procures a reconciliation between Alexander Pheroras and Herod Â 1 VTOW as to Alexander since he perceived it impossible JL J to persuade his father that he was innocent he re solved to meet his calamities how severe soever they were so he composed four books against his enemies and confessed that jiehadbeen in aplotjbut declared withal that the greatest part of the courtiers were in a plot with him and chiefly Pheroras and Salome  nay that Salome once came and forced him to lie with her in the night time whether he would or no These books were put into Herod s hands and made a great clamour against the men in power And now it was that Archelaus came hasti ly into Judea as being affrighted for his son in law and his daughter and he came as a proper assistant and in a very pru dent manner and by a stratagem he obliged the king not toexe cute what he had threatened for when he was come to him he cried out  Where in the world is this wretched son in law  of mine Where shall I see the head of his which contrived f to murder his father which I will tear to pieces with my  own hands I will do the same also to my daughter who Â hath such a fine husband for although she be not a partner in  the plot yet by being the wife of such a creature she is pol Â luted And I cannot but admire at thy patience against  whom this plot is laid if Alexander be still alive  for as I  eame  s WARS or TÂ E JEWS Book I  came with what haste I could from Cappadocia I expected  to find him put to death for his crimes long ago but still in  order to make an examination with thee about my daughter  whom out of regard to thee and thy dignity I had espoused  to him in marriage but now we must take counsel about  them both and if thy paternal affection be so great that thou  canst not punish thy son who hath plotted against thee let Â us change our right hands and let us succeed one to the other  in expressing our rage upon this occasion 2 When he had made this pompous declaration he got He rod to remit of his anger though he were in disorder who there upon gave him the books which Alexander had composed to be read by him and as he came to every head he considered of it together with Herod So Archelaus took hence the occasion for that stratagem which he made use of and by degrees he had the blame on those men whose names were in these books and es pecially upon Pheroras and when he saw that the king believed him to be in earnest he said  We must consider whether  the joung man be not himself plotted against by such a num  ber of wicked wretches and not thou plotted against by the  young man for I cannot see any occasion for his falling into  so horrid a crime since he enjoys the advantages of royalty  already and has the expectation of being one of thy succes  sors I mean this unless there were some persons that per  suade him to it and such persons as make an ill use of the fa  cility they know there is to persuade young men for by such  persons not only young men are sometimes imposed upon  but old men also and by them sometimes are the most illus  trious families and kingdoms overturued 3 Herod assented to what he had said and by degrees abated of his anger against Alexander but was more angry at Phero ras for the principal subject of the four books was Pheroras who perceiving that the king s inclinations changed on a sudden and that Archelaus s friendship could do every thing with him and that he had no honourable method of preserving himself he procured his safety by his impudence So he left Alexander and had recourse to Archelaus who told him That  he did not  see how he could get him excused now he was directly caught  in so many crimes whereby it was evidently demonstrated  that he had plotted against the king and had been the cause of  those misfortunes which the young man was now under un  less he would moreover leave off his cunning knavery and  his denials of what he was charged withal and confess the  charge and implore pardon of his brother who still had a  kindness Chap XXV WARS OF THE JEWS 329  kindness for him but that if he would do so he would afford  him all the assistance he was able 4 With this advice Pheroras complied and putting himself into such a habit as might most move compassion he came with black cloth upon his body and tears in his eyes and threw him self down at Herod s feet and begged his pardon for what he had done and confessed that he had acted very wickedly and was guilty of every thing that he had been accused of and lamented that disorder of his mind and distraction which his love to a wo man he said had brought him to So when Archelaus had brought Pheroras to accuse and bear witness against himself he then made an excuse for him and mitigated Herod s anger to wards him and this by using certain domestical examples  For  that when he had suffered much greater mischiefs from a bro  ther of his own he preferred the obligations of nature before â the passion of revenge because it is in kingdoms as it is in  gross bodies where some member or other is ever swelled by  the bodies weight in which case it is not proper to cut off  such member but to heal it by a gentle method of cure 5 Upon Archelaus s saying this and much more to the same purpose Herod s displeasure against Pheroras was molified yet did he persevere in his own indignation against Alexander and said he would have his daughter divorced and taken away from him and this till he had brought Herod to that pass that con trary to his former behaviour to him he petitioned Archelaus for the young man and that he would let his daughter continue espoused to him but Archelaus made him strongly believe that he would permit her to be married to any one else but not to Alexander because he looked upon it as a very valuable advan tage that the relation they had contracted by that affinity and the privileges that went along with it might be preserved And when the king said that his son would take it for a great favour to him if he would not dissolve that marriage especially since they had already children between the young man and her and since that wife of his was so well beloved by him and that as while she remains his wife she would be a great preservative to him and keep him from offending as he had formerly done so if she should be once torn away from him she would be the cause of his falling into despair because such young men s attempts are best molified when they are diverted from them by settling their affections at home So Archelaus complied with what Herod desired but not without difficulty and was both himself reconciled to the young man and reconciled his father to him al so However he said he must by all means be sent to Rome VOL III T t to 330 WARS OF THE JEWS Book I to discourse with Caesar because he had already written a full account to him of this whole matter 6 Thus a period was put to Archelaus s stratagem whereby ie delivered his son in law out of the dangers he was in  but when these reconciliations were over they spent their time in feastings and agreeable entertainments And when Archelaus was going away Herod made him a present of seventy talents with a golden throne set with precious stones and some eunuchs and a concubine who was called Pannychis He also paid due honours to every one of his friends according to their dignity In like manne r did all the king s kindred by his command make glorious presents to Archelaus and so he was conducted on his way by Herod and his nobility as far as Antioch CHAP XXVI How Eurycles calumniated the sons of Mariamne  and bt v Euaratus of Cos s apology for them bad no effect f 1 T O W a little afterward there came into Judea a man that J 1 was much superior to Archelaus s stratagems who did not onlyoverturnthatreconciliation that had ber nsowiselymade with Alexander but proved the occasion of his ruin He was a Lacedemonian and his name was Eurycles He was so corrupt a man that out of the desire of getting money he chose to live under a king for Greece could not suffice his luxury He pre sented Herod with splendid gifts as a bait which he laid in order to compass his ends and quickly receiving them back again mani fold yet did he esteembare gifts asnothing unless he imbrued the kingdom in blood by his purchases Accordingly he imposed upon the king by flattering him and by talking subtily to him as also by the lying encomiums which he made upon him  for as he soon perceived Herod s blind side so he said and did every thing that might please him and thereby became one of his most intimate friends  for both the king and all that were about him had a great regard for this Spartan on account of his country 2 Now as soon as this fellow perceived the rotten parts of the family and what quarrels the brothers had one with another and  This vile fellow Eurycles the Lacedemonian seems to have been the same who is mentioned by Plutarch as is years before a companion to Mark Antony and as living with Herod  whence he might easily insinuate himself into the ac quaintance ef Hertd s sons Antipater and Alexander as Usher Hudson and Spanheim justly suppose The reason why his being a Spartan rendered him ac ceptable to the Jews as we here see he was is visible from the public records of the Jews and Spartans owning those Spartans to be of kin to the Jews and deÂ rived from their common ancestor Abraham the first patriarch of the Jewish na tion Anfiq B XII ch iv sect 10 B XIII ch v sect 8 Vol II and I B XII ch vil f See the preceding note Chap XXVI WARS OF THE JEWS 331 I and in what disposition the father was towards each of them he Chose to take his lodging at the first in the house of Antipater but deluded Alexander with a pretence of friendship to him and falsely claimed to be an old acquaintance of Archelaus for which reason he was presently admitted into Alexander s familiarity as a fathful friend He also soon recommended himself to his brother Aristobulus And when he had thus made trial of these several persons he imposed upon one of them by one method and upon another by another But he was principally hired by Antipater and so betrayed Alexander and this by reproaching Antipater because while he was the eldest son he overlooked the intrigues of those who stood in the way of his expectations and by reproaching Alexander because he who was born of a queen and was married to a king s daughter permitted one that was born of a mean woman to lay claim to the succession and this when he had Archelaus to support him in the most complete manner Nor was his advice thought to be other than faithful by the young man because of his pretended friendship with Ar chelaus on which account it was that Alexander lamented to him Antipater s behaviour with regard to himself and this with out concealing any thing from him and how it was no wonder if Herod after he had killed their mother should deprive them of her kingdom Upon this Eurycles pretended to commiser ate his condition and to grieve with him He also by a bait that he laid for him procured Aristobulus tosay thesame things Thus did he inveigle both the brothers to make complaints of their father and then went to Antipater and carried these grand secrets to him He also added a fiction of his own as if his brothers had laid a plot against him and were almost ready to come upon him with their drawn swords For this intelligence he received a great sum of money and on that account he com mended Antipater before his father and at length undertook the work of bringing Alexander and Aristobulus to their graves and accused them before their father So he came to Herod and told him That  he would save his life as a requital for the  favours he had received from him and would preserve his light of life by wayof retribution for his kind entertainment a for that a sword had been long whetted and Alexander s right  hand had been long stretched out against him but that he had  laid impediments in his way prevented his speed and that bv  pretending to assist him in his design how Alexander said  that Herod was not contented to reign in a kingdom that be  longed to others and to make delapidations in their mother s  government after he had killed her but besides all this that  he introduced a spurious successor and proposed to give the T t 2  kingdom 932 W ARS OF THE JEWS Book T  kingdom of their ancestors to that pestilent fellow AntirSater  that he would now appease the ghosts of Hyrcanus and Ma  riamne by taking vengeance on him for that it was not fit  for him to take the succession to the government from such a  fatherwithout bloodshed thatmany tilings happen every day to  provoke him so todo insomuch that hecan say nothingat all but  it affords occasion tor calumny against him for that ifanymen  tiou be made of nobility of birth even in other cases he is a  bused unjustly while his father would say that nobody to be  sure is of noble birth but Alexander and that his father was  inglorious fpr want of such nobility If they be at any time  hunting and he says nothing he gives offence and if he com  mends any body they take it in way of jest that they always  find their father unmercifully severe and have no natural af  fection for any of them but for Antipater on which accounts â if his plot does not take he is very willing to die but that in  case he kill his father he hath sufficient opportunities forsa  ving himself In the first place he hath Archelaus his father  in law to whom be can easily fly and in the next place he  hath Caesar who hath never known Herod s character to this  day for that he shall not appear then before him with that  dread he used to do when his father was there to terrify him  and that he will not then produce the accusations that con  cerned himself alone but would in the first place openly in Â sist on the calamities of their nation and how they are taxed Â to death and in what ways of luxury and wicked practices Â that wealth is spent which was gotten by blood shed what  sort of persons they are that get our riches and to whom those  cities belong upon whom he bestows his favours  that he Â would have inquiry made what became of his grand father  Hyrcanus and his mother Mariamne and would openly  proclaim the gross wickedness that was in the kingdom on  which accounts he should not be deemed a parracide 3 When Eurycles had made this portentous speech he great ly Commended Antipater as the only child that had an affection for his father and on that account was an impediment to the o thers plot against him Hereupon the king who had hardly re pressed his anger upon the former accusations was exasperated to an incurable degree At which time Antipater took another occasion to send in other persons to his father to accuse his breth ren and to tell him that they had privately discoursed with Ju cundus audTyrannus who had once been masters of the horse to the king but for some offences had been put out of that honour able employment Herod was in a very great rage at these in formations and presently ordered those men to be tortured yet did Chap XXVII WARS OF THE JEWS 333 did not they confess any thing of what the king had been inform ed but a certain letter was produced as written by Alexander to the governor of a castle to desire him to receive him and A ristobulus into the castle when he had killed his father and to give them weapons and what other assistance he could upon that occasion Alexander said that this letter was a forgery of Dio phantus ThisDiophantuswasthe king s secretary a bold man and cunning in counterfeiting any one s hand and after he had counterfeited a great numberj he was at last put to death for it Herod did also order the governor of the castle to be tortured but got nothing out of him of what the accusations suggested 4 However although Herod fonnd the proofs too weak he gave order to have his sons kept in custody for till now they had been at liberty He also called that pest of his family and forger of all this vile accusation Eurycles his saviour and be nefactor and gave him a reward of fifty talents Upon which he prevented any accurate accounts that could come of what he had done by going immediately into Cappadocia and there he got money of Archelaus having the impudence to pretend that he had reconciled Herod to Alexander He thence passed over into Greece and used what he had thus wickedly gotten to the like wicked purposes Accordingly he was twice accused be fore Caesar that he had filled Achaiawith sedition and had plun dered its cities and so he was sent into banishment And thus was he punished far what wicked actions he had been guilty of about Aristobulus and Alexander 5 But it will be now worth while to put Euaratos of Cos in Opposition to this Spartan  for as he was one of Alexander s most intimate friends and came to him in his travels at the same time that Eurycles came so the king put the question to him whetherthose things of which Alexander was accusedweretrue He assured him upon oath that he had never heard any such things from the young men yet did this testimony avail no thing for the clearing those miserable creatures for Herod was only disposed and most ready to hearken to what made a gainst them  and every one was most agreeable to him that would believe they were guilty and shewed their indignation at them CHAP XXVII Herod ly Cxsar s direction accuses hit sons at fcerytus Tt ey are not produced before the court but yet are condemned and in a little time they are sent to Sebaste and strangled thert Â 1 A T OREO VER Salome exasperated Herod s cruelty a i YJL gainst his sons for Aristobulus was desirous tobring her 334 WARS OF THE JEWS Book f her who was his mother in law and his aunt into the like dan gers with themselves so he sent to her to take care of her own safety and told her that the king was preparing to put her to death on account of the accusation that was laid againt her as if when she formerly endeavoured to marry herself to Sylleus the Arabian she had discovered the king s grand secrets to him who was the king s enemy and this it was that came as the last storm and entirely sunk the young men when they were in great danger before For Salome came running to the king and informed him of what admonition had been given her where upon he could bear no longer but commanded both the young men to be bound and kept the one asunder from the other He also sent Volumnius the general of his army to Caesar imme diately as also his friend Olympus with him who carried the informations in writing along with them Now as soon as they had sailed to Rome and delivered the king s letters to Caesar Caesar was mightily troubled at the ease of the young men yet did not he think he ought to take the power from the father of condeming his sons so he wrote back to him and appointed him to have the power over his sons but said withal that  he would  do well to make an examination into this matter of the plot  against him in a public court and to take for his assessors Â his own kindred and the governors of the province And if  those sons be found guilty to put them to death but if they Â Â appear to have thought of no more than fly ing away from him  that he should moderate their punishment 2 With these directions Herod complied and came to BÂ ry tus where Caesar had ordered the court to be assembled and got the judicature together The presidents sat first as Caesar 9 letters had appointed who were Saturninus and Pedanius and their lieutenants that were with them with whom was the pro curator Volumnius also next to them sat the king s kinsmen and friends with Salome also and Pheroras after whom sat the principal men of all Syria excepting Archekus for Herod had a suspicion of him because he was Alexander s father in law Yet did not he produce his sons in open court and this was done very cunningly for he knew well enough that had they but appeared only they would certainly have been pitied and if withal they had been suffered to speak Alexander would easily have answered what they were accused of but they were in custody at Platane a village of the Sidoniaiis 3 So the king got up and inveighed against his sons as if they were present  and as for that part of the accusation that they had plotted p gainst him he urged it but faintly because he was destitute of proofs but he insisted before the assessors on the re proaches and jests and injurious carriage and ten thousand the like Chap XXVII WARS OF THE JEWS 335 like offences against him which were heavier than death itself j and when nobody contradicted him he moved them to pity his case as though he had been condemned himself now he had gained a bitter victory against his sons So he asked every one s sentence which sentence was first of all given by Saturninus and was this Tiiat he condemned the young men but not to death for that it was not fit for him who had three sons of his own now present to give his vote for the destruction of the son of another The two lieutenants also gave the like vote some others there were also who followed their example but Volumnius began to vote on the more melancholy side and all those that came after him condemned the young men to die some out of flattery and some out of hatred to Herod but none out of indignation at their crimes And now all Syria and Ju dea was in great expectation and waited for the last act of this tragedy yet did not nobody suppose that Herod would be so barbarous as to murder his children however he carried them away to Tyre and thence sailed to Caesarea and deliberated with himself what sort of death the young men should suffer 4 Now there was a certain old soldier of the king s whose name was Tcro who had a son that was very familiar with and a friend to Alexander and who himself particularly loved the young men This soldier was in a manner distracted out of the excess of the indignation he had at what was doing and at first he criedoutaloud ashehe went about  That justicewas tramp  led under foot that truth was perished and nature confound  ed and that the life of man was full of iniquity and every thing else that passion could suggest to a man who spared not his own life and at last he ventured to go to the king and said  Truly I think thou art a most miserable man when thou  hearkenest to most wicked wretches against those that ought  to be dearest to thee since thou hast frequently resolved that  Pheroras and Salome sbould be put to death and yet believest  them against thy sons while these by cutting off the sac  cession of thine own sons leave all wholly to Antipater and  thereby choose to have thee sueh a king as may be thorough  ly in their own power However consider whether this  death of Antipater s brethren will not make him hated by the  soldiers for there is no body but commiserates the young  men and of the captains a great many shew their indignation  at it openly Upon his saying this he named those that had such indignation but the king ordered those men with Tero himself and his son to be seized upon immediately 5 At which time there was a certain barber whose name wa This man leaped out from among the people in a kind of 838 WARS OF THE JEWS  â  Book I of madness and accused himself and said  This Tero endea  voured to persuade me also to cut thy throat with my ra  zor when I trimmed thee and promised that Alexander  should give me large presents for so doing When Herod heard this he examined Tero with his son and the barber by the torture but as the others denied the accusation and he said nothing farther Herod gave order that Tero should be racked more severely but his son out of pity to his father promised to discover the whole to the king if he would grant that his father should be no longer tortured when he had agreed to this he said That  his father at the persuasion of  Alexander had an intention to kill him Now some said this was forged in order to free his father from his torments and some said it was true 6 And now Herod accused the captains and Tero in an as sembly of the people and brought the people together in a body against them  and accordingly there were they put to death to gether with Trypho the barber they were killed by the pie ces of wood and the stones that were thrown at them He also sent his sons to Sebaste a city not far from Caesarea and order ed them to be there strangled and as what he had ordered was executed immediately so he commanded that their dead bodies should be brought to the fortress Alexandrium to be buried with Alexander their grandfather by the mother s side And this was the end of Alexander and Aristobulus CHAP XXVIII How dntipater is hated of all men

when she had been at variance with him contrived this match he also got into Pheroras s favour and into the favour of Cae sar s friends by presents and other ways of obsequiousness and Â ent no small sums of money to Rome Saturninus also and his friends in Syria were all well replenished with the presents he made them yet the more he gave the more he was hated as not making these presents out of generosity but spending his money out of fear Accordingly it so fell out that the receivers bore him no more good will than before but that those to whom he gave nothing were his more bitter enemies How ever he bestowed his money every day more and more pro fusely on observing that contrary to his expectations the king was taking care about the orphans and discovering at the same time his repentance for killing their fathers by his commisera tion of those that sprang from them 2 Accordingly Herod got together his kindred and friends and set before them the children and with his eyes full of tears said thus to them  It was an unlucky fate that took away  from me these children s fathers which children are recom  mended to me by that natural commiseration which their or  phan condition requires however I will endeavour though  1 have been a most unfortunate father to appear a better  grandfather and to leave these children such curators after  myself as are dearest to me I therefore betroth thy daughter u Pheroras to the elder of these brethren the children of Alex  ander that thou mayest be obliged to take care of them I  also betroth to thy son Antipater the daughter of Aristobu Â lus be thou therefore a father to that orphan and my son  Herod Philip shall have her sister whose grandfather by  the mother s side was high priest And let every one that  loves me be of my sentiments in these dispositions which  none that hath an affection for me will abrogate And I pray  God that he will join these children together in marriage to  the advantage of my kingdom and of my posterity and may  he look down with eyes more serene upon them than he M looked upon their fathers 3 While he spake these words he wept and joined the child ren s right hands together after which he embraced them every one after an affectionate manner and dismissed the assembly Upon this Antipater was in great disorder immediately and lamented publicly at what was done for he supposed that this dignity which was conferred on these orphans was for his own destruction even in his father s lifetime and that he should run another risk of losing the government if Alexander s son should bavfi both Archelaus a king and Pheroras a tetarch to sup VOL III U u port 338 Hook I WARS OF THE JEW port them He also considered how be was himself hated by the nation and how they pitied these orphans how great affec tion the Jews bare to those brethren of his when they were alive and how gladly they remembered them now they had perished by his means So he resolved by all the ways possi ble to get these espousals dissolved 4 Now he was afraid of going subtilly about this matter with his father who was hard to be pleased and was presently moved upon the least suspicion so he ventured to go to him di rectly and to beg of him before his face not to deprive him of that dignity which he had been pleased to bestow upon him and that he might not have the bare name of a king while the power was in other persons for that he should never be able to keep the government if Alexander s son was to have both his grand father Archelaus and Fheroras for his curators and he be sought him earnestly since there were so many of the royal fa mily alive that he would change those intended marriages Now the king had  nine wives and children by seven of them Antipater was himself born of Doris and Herod Philip of Mariamne the high priest s daughter Antipas also and Archer laus were by Malthace the Samaritan as his daughterOly mpias which his brother Joseph s f son had married by Cleopatra of Jerusalem he had Herod and Philip and by Pallas Phasaelus he had also two daughters Roxana and Salome the one by Phedra and the other by Elpis he had also two wives that had no children the one his first cousin and the other his niece and  besides these he had two daughters the sisters of Alexander and Aristobulus by Mariamne Since therefore the royal family was so numerous Antipater prayed him to change these in tended marriages 5 When the king perceived what disposition he was in to wards these orphans he was angry at it and a suspicion came into his mind as to these sons whom he had put to death whether that had not been brought about by the false tales of Antipater so at that time he made Antipater a long and a peevish answer and bid him be gone Yet was he afterwards prevailed  Dean

that he had no more than fifteen children by them all f To prevent confusien it may not be amiss with Dean Aldrich to distinguish  between four Josephs in the history of Herod I Joseph Herod s uncle

Aristobulus s daughter to him and his son to Pheroras s daughter 0 Now one may learn in this instance how very much this flattering Antipater could do even what Salome in the like cir cumstances could not do  for when she who was his sister and who by the means of Julia Caesar s wife earnestly desired leave to be married to Sylleus the Arabian Herod swore he would esteem her his bitter enemy unless she would leave off that pro ject he also eaused her against her own consent to be married to Alexas a friend of his and that one of her daughters should be married to Alexas s son and the other to Antipater s uncle by the mother s side And for the daughters the king had by Mariambe the one was married to Antipater his sister s son and the other to his brother s son Phasaelus CHAP XXIX Antipater becomes Intolerable He is sent to Rome and carries Herod s testament viith him Pheroras leaves his brother that be may keep his wife He dies at home J 1 T OW when Antipater had cut off the hopes of the or JL NI phans and had contracted such affinities as would be most for his own advantage he proceeded briskly as having a certain expectation of the kingdom and as he had now assur ance added to his wickedness he became intolerable  for not being able to avoid the hatred of all people he built his security Upon the terror he struck into them Pheroras also assisted him in his designs looking upon him as already fixed in the kingdom There Was also a company of women in the court which ex cited new disturbances  for Pheroras s wife together with her mother and siste as also Antipater s mother grew very im pudent in the palace She also was so insolent as to affront the king s  two daughters on which account the king hated her to a great degree yet although these women were hated by him  they domineered over others there was only Salome who op posed their good agreement and informed the king of their meetings as not being for the advantage of his affairs And when those women knew what calamities she had raised against them and how much Herod was displeased they left off their public meetings and friendly entertainments of one another Â These daughters of Herod whom Pheroras s wife affronted were Salome and Roxana two virgins who were born to him of his two wives Elpide and Phedra SÂ e Herod s genealogy Antiq B XVII ch i sect 3 Vol III  U U 2 WARS OF THE JEWS    Book L nay on the contrary they pretended to quarrel one with another when the king was within hearing The like dissimulation did Antipater make use of and when matters were public he opposed Pheroras but still they had private cabals andmsrry meetings in the night time  nor did the observation of others do any more than confirm their mutual agreement However Salome knew every thing they did and told every thing to Herod 2 But he was inflamed with anger at them and chiefly at Pheroras s wife for Salome had principally accused her So he got an assembly of his friends and kindred together and there accused this woman of many things and particularly of the af fronts she had offered his daughters and that she had supplied the Pharisees with money by way of rewards for what they had done against him and had procured his brother to become his enemy by giving him love potions At length he turned his speech to Pheroras and told him That  he would give him  his choice of these two things whether he would keep in with his brother or with his wife And when Pheroras said that he would  die rather than forsake his wife Herod not knowing what to do farther in that matter turned his speech to Antipater and charged him to have no intercourse either witk Pheroras s wife or with Pheroras himself or with any one be longing to her Now though Antipater did not transgress that his injunction publicly yet did he in secret come to their night meeting j and because he was afraid that Salome observed what he did he procured by the means of his Italian friends that he might go and live at Rome for when they wrote that it was proper for Antipater to be sent to Caesar for some time Herod made no delay but sent him and that with a splendid attendance and a great deal of money and gave him his testament to carry with him wherein Antipater had the kingdom bequeathed to him and wherein Herod was named for Antipater s successor that Herod I mean who was the son of Mariamne the high priest s daughter 3 Sylleus also the Arabian sailed to Rome without any regard to Caesar s injunctions and this in order to oppose Anti pater 11 This strange obstinacy of Pheroras in retaining his wife who was one of a low family and refusing to marry one nearly related to Herod though he so ear nestly desired it as also that wife s admission to the counsels of the other great cotrt hdies together with Herod s own importunity as to Pheroras s divorce and other marriage all so remarkable here or in the Antiquities B XVII ch ii sect 4 Vol III and ch iii sect 3 cannot be well accounted for but on the supposal that Pheroras believed and Herod suspected that the Pharisees prediction as if the crown of Judea should be translated from Herod to Pheroras s posterity and that most probably to Pheroras s posterity by this his wife also would prove true See Anticj B XVII ch ii secc 4 and ch iii sect I Vol III Chap XXIX WARS OF THE JEWS 941 pater with all his might as to that law suit which Nicolaus had with him before This Sylleus had also a great contest with Aretas his own king for he had slain many others of Aretas s friends and particularly Sohemus the most potent man in ihe city Petra Moreover he had prevailed with Phabatus who was Herod s steward by giving him a great sum of money to assist him against Herod but when Herod gave him more he induced him to leave Sylleus and by his means he demanded of him all that Caesar had required of him to pay But when Syl leus paid nothing of what he was to pay and did also accuse Phabatus to Caesar and said that he was not a steward for Cae sar s advantage but for Herod s Phabatus was angry at him on that account but was still in very great esteem with Herod and discovered Sylleus s grand secrets and told the king that Sylleus had corrupted Corinthus one of the guards of his body by bribing him and of whom he must therefore have a care Ac cordingly the king complied for this Corinthus though he were brought up in Herod s kingdom yet was he by birth an Arabian so they king ordered him to be taken up immediately and not only him but two other Arabians who were caught with him the one of them was Sylleus s friend the other the head of a tribe The last being put to the torture confessed that they had prevailed with Corinthus for a large sum of mo ney to kill Herod and when they had been farther examined before Saturninus the president of Syria they were sent to Rome 4 However Herod did not leave off importuning Pheroras but proceeded to force him to put away his wife yet could he not devise any way by which he could bring the woman herself to punishment although he had many causes of hatred to her  till at length he was in such great uneasiness at her that he cast both her and his brother out of his kingdom Pheroras took this injury very patiently and went away into his own tetrarchy Perea beyond Jordan and sware that there should be but one end put to his flight and that should be Herod s death  and that he would never return while he was alive Nor indeed would he return when his brother was sick although he earnestly sent for him to come to him because he had a mind to leave some injunctions with him before he died but Herod unexpectedly recovered A little afterward Pheroras himself fell sick when Herod shewed great moderation  for he came to him and pitied his case and took care of him but his affection for him did him ho good for Pheroras died a little afterward Now though Herod had so gi eat an affection for him to the last day of his life yet was a report spread abroad that he had killed him by poison However he took care to have his dead body carried â to 342 Book I wars of the jewS to Jerusalem and appointed a very great mourning to the whole nation for him and bestowed a most pompous funeral upon him And this was the end that one of Alexander s and Aristobulus s murderers came to CHAP XXX When Herod made enquiry about Pheroras s death a discovery was made that Antipater had prepared a poisonous draught for him Herod casts Doris and her accomplices as aha Mariamne out of the palace and blots her son Herod out of his testament f l T UT now the punishment was transferred unto the ori D ginal author Antipater and took its rise from the death of Pheroras for certain of his freed men came with a sad countenance to the king and told him That  his brother had  been destroyed by poison and that his wife had brought him  somewhat that was prepared after an unusual manner and  that upon his eating it he presently fell into bis distemper  that Antipater s mother and sister two days before brought a  woman out of Arabia that was skilful in mixing such drugs  that she might prepare a love potion for Pheroras and that  instead of a love potion she had given him deadly poison   and that this was done by the management of Sylleus who  was acquainted with that woman 2 The king was deeply affected with somany suspicious and had the maid servants and some of the free women also tortured one of which cried out iu her agonies  May that God that go  verns the earth and the heaven punish this author of all these  our miseries Antipater s mother I The king took a handle from this confession and proceeded to inquire farther into the truth of the matter So this woman discovered the friendship of Antipater s mother to Pheroras and Antipater s women as also their secret meetings and that Pheroras and Antipater had drunk with them fox a whole night together as they returned from the king and would not suffer any body either man ser vant or maid servant to be there while one of the free women discovered the matter 3 Upon this Herod tortured the maid servants every one by themselves separately who all unanimously agreed in the fore going discoveries and that accordingly by agreement they went away Antipater to Rome and Pheroras ta Perea for that they oftentimes talked to one another thus  That after Herod  had slain Alexander and Aristobulus he would fall upon them  and upon their wives because after he had not spared Ma  riarnne Chap XXX WARS OF THE JEWS  343  riamne and her children he would spare nobody and that  for this reason it was best to get as far off the wild beast as  they were able And that Antipater oftentimes lamented his own case before his mother and said to her That he had  already grey hairs upon his head and that his father grew  younger again every day and that perhaps death Would over  take him before he should begin to be a king in earnest and f that in case Herod should die which yet nobody knew when P it would be the enjoyment of the succession could certainly  be but for a little time for that these heads of Hydra the ff sons of Alexander and Aristobulus were growing up that  he was deprived by his father of the hopes of being succeed  ed by his children for that his successor after his death was H not to be anyone of his own sons but Herod the son ofMari f amne that in this point Herod was plainly distracted to think  that his testament should therein take place for he would  take care that not one of his posterity should remain because he was of all fathers the greatest hater of his children Yet  does he hate his brother still worse whence it was that he a u while ago gave himself an hundred talents that he should not  have any intercourse with Pheroras And when Pheroras H said Wherein have we done him any harm Antipater repli H ed I wish he would but deprive us of all we have and leave  us naked and alive only but it is indeed impossible to escape  this wild beast who is thus given to murder who will not permit us to love any person openly although we be togeth  er privately yet may we be so openly too if we have but  the courage and the hands of men 4 These things were said by the women upon the torture as also that Phertfras resolved to fly with them to Perea NoW Herod gave credit to all they said on account of the affair of the hundred talents for he had had no discourse with any body about them but only with Antipater So he vented his anger first of all against Antipater s mother and took away from her all the ornaments which he had given her which cost a great many talents and cast her out of the palace a second time He also took care of Pheroras s women after their tortures as be ing now reconciled to them but he was in great consternation himself and inflamed upon every suspicion and had many in nocent persons led to the torture out of his fear lest he should leave any guilty person untortured 5 And now it was that he betook himself to examine Anti pater of Samaria who was the steward of his son Antipater and upon torturing him he learned that Antipater had sent for J potion of deadly poison for him opt of Egypt by Antiphilus a com 344 WARS OF THE JEWS  Book Ti a companion of his  that Theudio the uncle of Antipater had it from him and delivered it to Pheroras  for that Antipater had charged him to take his father off while he was at Rome and so free from the suspicion of doing it himself that Pheroras al so commited this potion to his wife Then did the king send for her and bid her bring to him what she had received imme diately So she came out of her house as if she would bring it with her but threw herself down from the top of the house in order to prevent any examination and torture from the king However it came to pass as it seems by the providence of God when he intended to bring Antipater to punishment that she fell riot upon her head but npon other parts of her body and escap ed The king when she was brought to him took care of her for she was at first quite senseless upon her fall and asked her why she had thrown herself down and gave her his oath that if she would speak the real truth he would excuse her from pu nishment  but that if she concealed any thing he would have her body torn to pieces by torments and leave no part of it to be buried 6 Upon this the woman paused a little and then said  Why  do I spare to speak of these grand secrets now Pheroras is  dead that would only tend to save Antipater who is all our  destruction Hear then O king and be thou and God him  self who cannot be deceived witnesses to the truth of what I  am going to say When thou didst sit weeping by Pheroras  as he was dying then it was that he called me to him and said  My dear wife J have been greatly mistaken as to the disposi  tion of my brother towards me and have hated him that is so  affectionate to me and have contrived to kill him who is in  such disorder for me before I am dead As for myself I re  ceive the recompence of my impiety but do thou bring what  poison was left with us by Antipater and which thou keepest  in order to destroy him and consume it immediately in the  fire in my sight that I may not be liable to the avenger in the  invisible world This 1 brought as he bid me and emptied  the greatest part of it into the fire but reserved a little of it  for my own use against uncertain futurity and out of my fear Â of thee 7 When she had said this she brought the box which had a small quantity of this potion in it but the king let her alone and transferred the tortures to Antiphilus s mother and brother who both confessed that Antiphilus brought the box out of E gypt and that they had received the potion from a brother of his who was a physician at Alexandria Then did the ghosts of Alexander and Aristobulus go round all the palace and b came Chap XXXI  WARS OF THE JEWS 345 came the inquisitors and discoverers of what could not otherwise have been found out and brought such as were the freest from suspicion to be examined whereby it was discovered that Ma riamne the high priest s daughter was conscious of this plot and her very brothers when they were tortured declared it so to be Whereupon the king avenged this insolent attempt of the mother upon her son and blotted Herod whom he had by her out of his testament who had been before named therein as successor to Antipater CHAP XXXI Antipater is convicted by Bathyllus  But be still returns from Rome without knowing it Herod brings him to bis trial Â 1 A FTER these things were over Bathyllus came under JL examination in order to convict Antipater who pro ved the concluding attestation to Antipater s designs for indeed he was no other than his freed man This man came and brought another deadly potion the poison of asps and the juices of other serpents that if the first potion did not do the business Pheroras and his wife might be armed with this also to destroy the king He brought also an addition to Antipater s insolent attempt against his father which was the letters which he wrote against his brethren Archelaus and Philip which were the king s sons and educated atRome beingyet youths but of generous dispositions Antipater set himself to get rid of these as soon as he could that they might not be prejudicial to his hopes and to that end he forged letters against them in the name of his friends at Rome Some of these he corrupted by bribes to write how they grossly reproached their father and did openly bewail Alexander and Aristobulus and were uneasy at their being recalled for their father had already sent for them which was the very thing that troubled Antipater 2 Nay indeed while Antipater was in Judea and before he was upon his journey to Rotne he gave money to have the like letters against them sent from Rome and then came to his father who as yet had no suspicion of him and apologized for his breth ren and alleged on their behalf that some of the things contain ed in those letters were false andothers of themwere onlyyouth ful errors Yet at the same time that he expended a great deal of his money by making presents to such as wrote against his brethren didheaimtobringhis accounts intoconfusion bybuying cos tly garments andcarpets of various contextures withsilver and gold cups and a great many more curious things that so among the very great expences laid out upon such furniture he might VOL HI X x conceal WARS OF THE JEWS  Book I conceal the money he had used in hiring men to write the let  ters for he brought in an aecount of his expences amounting  to two hundred talents his main pretence for which was the law suit he had been in with Sylleus So while all his rogue  tits even those of a lesser sort also were covered by his greater villainy while all the examinations by torture proclaimed his attempt to murder his father and the letters proclaimed his second attempt to murder his brethren yet did noone of those that came to Rome inform him of his misfortunes in Judea al though seven months had intervened between his conviction and his return so great was the hatred which they all bore to him  And perhaps they were the ghosts of those brethren of his that had been murdered that stopped the mouths of those that in tended to have told him He then wrote from Rome and in formed his friends that he would soon come to them and how he was dismissed with honour by Caesar 3 Now the king being desirous to get this plotter against him intohishands and berngalso afraid lest heshould some waycome to the knowledge how his affairs stood and be upon his guard he dissembled his anger in his epistle to him as in other points he wrote kindly to him and desired him to make haste because if he came quit kly he would then lay aside the complaints he had against his mother for Antipater was not ignorant that his mother had been expelled out of the palace However he had before received a letter which contained an account of the death of Pheroras at  Tarentum and made great lamentations at it for which some commended him as being for his own uncle though probably this confusion arose on account of his having thereby failed in his plot on his father s life and his tears were more for the loss of him that was to have been sub servient therein than for an uncle Pheroras moreover a sort of fear came upon him as to his designs lest the poison should have been discovered However when he was in Cilicia he received the forementioned epistle from his father and made great haste accordingly But when he had sailed to Celenderis a suspicion came into his mind relating to his mother s misfor tunes as if his soul foreboded some mischief to itself Those therefore of his friends which were the most considerate ad vised him not rashly to goto his father till he had le irned what were the occasions v hy his mother had been ejected because they were afraid that he might be involved in the calumnies that had been cast upon his mother but those that were less con siderate and had more regard to their own desires of seeing their native country than to Antipater s safety persuaded him to make haste home and not by delaying his journey afford his father This Tarcntum haÂ coins ctiil extant as RehtiJ informs us here in his note Chap XXXI WARS OF THE JEWS 3 4T father ground for an ill suspicion and give an handle to those that raised stories against him for that in case any thing had  beenmovedtohisdisadvantage itwasowing to hisabsence which durst not have been done had he been present And they said it was absurd to deprive himself of certain happiness for the sake of an uncertain suspicion and not rather to return to his father and take the royal authority upon him which was in a state of fluctuation on his account only Antipater compli ed with this last advice for Providence hurried him on to his destruction 80 he passed over the sea and landed at Sebas tus the haven of Cesarea  4 And here he found a perfect and unexpected solitude while every body avoided him and no body durst come at him for he was equally hated by all men and now that hatred had liberty to shew itself and the dread men were in at the king s anger made men keep from him for the whole city of Jerusa lem was filled with the rumours about Antipater and Anti pater himself was the only person who was ignorant of them for as no man was dismissed more magnificently when he began his voyage to Rome so was no man now received back with greater ignominy And indeed he began already to suspect what misfortunes there were in Herod s family yet did he cun ningly conceal his suspicion and while he was inwardly ready to die for fear he put on a forced boldness of countenance Nor could he now fly any whither nor had he any way of emerg ing out of the difficulties which encompassed him nor indeed had he even there any certain intelligence of the affairs of the royal family by reason of the threats the king had given out yet had he some small hopes of better tidings for perhaps no thing had been discovered or if any discovery had been made perhaps he should be able to clear himself by impudence and artful tricks which were the only things he relied upon for his deliverance  5 And with these hopes did he screen himself till he came to the palace without any friends with him for these were affronted and shutout at the first gate Now Varus the pre sident of Syria happened to be in the palace at this juncture sp Antipater went in to his father and putting on a bold face he came near to salute him but Herod stretched out his hands and turned his head away from him and cried out Even this  is an indication of a parricide to be desirous to g t me into M his arms when he is under such heinous accusations God  confound thee thou vile wretch do not thou touch me till  thou hast cleared thyself of these crimes that are charged uport ff thee J appoint thee a court where thou art to be judged and X x 2  this 348 Book I WARS OF THE JEWS  this Varus who is very seasonably here to be thy judge and  get thou thy defence ready against to morrow for I give  thee so much time to prepare suitable excuses for thyself And as Antipater was so confounded that he was able to make no answer to this charge he went away but his mother and wife came to him and told him of all the evidence they had gotten against him Hereupon he recollected himself and con sidered what defence he should make against the accusations CHAP XXXII Antipater is accused before Varus and is convicted of laying a plot against his father by the strongest evidence Herod puts off his punishment till he should be recovered and in the mean time alters his testament j 1 VTQW the day following the king assembled a court of J_N hiskinsmenandfriends andcalledinAntipater sfriends also Herod himself with Varus were the presidents and He rod called for all the witnesses and ordered them to be brought in among whom some of the domestic servants of Antipater s mother were brought in also who had but a little while before been caught as they were carrying the following letter from her to her son Since all those things have been already discovered  to thy father do not thou come to him unless thou canst pro  cure some assistance from Caesar When this and the other witnesses were introduced Antipater came in and failing on his face before his father s feet he said  Father I beseech  thee do not condemn me before hand but let thy ears be un  biassed and attend to my defence for if thou wilt give me  leave 1 will demonstrate that I am innocent 2 Hereupon Herod cried out to him to hold his peace and spake thus to Varus  I cannot but think that thou Varus  and every other upright judge will determine that Antipater  is a vile wretch I am also afraid that thou wilt abhor my ill  fortune and judge me also myself worthy of all sorts of cala  mity for begetting such children while yet I ought rather  to be pitied who have been so affectionate a father to such  wretched sons for when I had settled the kingdom on my  former sons even when they were young and when be  sides the charges of their education at Rome I had made them  the friends of Caesar and made them envied by other kings I  found them plotting against me these have been put to death  and that in great measure for the sake of Antipater  for as f he was then young and appointed to be my successors I took  care chiefly to secure him from danger but this profligate Chap XXXII WARS OF TflE JEWS   349 Â wild beast when he had beenover and above satiated with that  patience which I shewed him he made use of that abundance I  had given him against myself for I seemed to him to live too  long and he was very uneasy at the old age I was arrived at nor could he stay any longer but wouldbe a king by parricide  And justly I am served by him for bringing him back out of the f country to court when he was of no esteem before and or  thrustingoutthosesonsof mine that were born of the queen and  for making him a successor to my dominions I confess to  thee O Varus the great folly I was guilty of for I provoked  those sons of mine to act against me and cut off their just es  pectations for the sake of Antipater and indeed what kind  ness did I do to them that could equal what I have done to  Antipater to whom I have in a manner yielded upmy  royal authority while I am alive and whom I have openly named for the successor to my dominions in my testament and given him a yearly revenue of his own fifty talents and sup plied him with money to an extravagant degree out of myown revenue and when he was about to sail to Rome I gave him  three hundred talents and recommended him andhim alone of  all my children to Caesar as his father s deliverer Now  what crimes were those other sons of mine guilty of like these  of Antipater and what evidence was there brought against  them so strong as there is to demonstrate this son to have plot  ted against me Yet does this parricide presume to speak for Â himself and hopes to obscure the truth by his cunning tricks  Thou O Varus must guard thyself against him for I know  the wild beast and 1 foresee howplausibly he will talk and his  counterfeit lamentation This was he who exhorted me to  have a care of Alexander when he was alive and not to in â  trust my body with all men This was he who came to my  very bed and looked about lest any one should lay snares for  me This was he who took care of my sleep and secured me  from any fear of danger who comforted me under the trouble  I was in upon the slaughter of my sons and looked to  see what affection mysurviving brethren bore me This was  my protector and the guardian of mybody And when Icallto  mind O Varus his craftiness upon every occasion and his art  of dissembling I can hardly believe that I am still alive and I  wonder how I have escaped such a deep plotter of mischief f However since some fate or other makes my house desolate  and perpetually raises up those that are dearest to me against  me I will with tears lament my hard fortune and private  ty groan under my lonesome condition yet am 1 resolved that   no WARS

he was in  but ordered Nicolaus one of his friends to produce the evidence against Antipater But in the mean time Antipater lifted up his head for he lay on the ground before his father s feet and cried out aloud  Thou O father hast  made my apology for me for how can 1 be a parricide w iom  thou thyself confessest to have always had for thy guardian  Thou callest my filial affection prodigious lies and hypocrisy  how then could it be that I who was so subtile in other  matters should here be so mad as not to understand that it  was not easy that he who committed so horrid a crime should  be

that this polluted body can make for if I be  a parricide I ought not to die without torture Thus did Antipater cry out with lamentation and weeping and moved all the rest and Varus in particular to commiserate his case Herod was the only person whose passion was too strong to per mit him to weep as knowing that the testimonies against hira were true   4 And now it was that at the king s command Nicolaus when he had premised a great deal about the craftiness of Anti pater and had prevented the effects of their commiseration to him afterwards brought in a bitter and large accusation against him ascribing all the wickedness that had been in the kingdom to him and especially the murder of his brethren and demon strated that they had perished by the calumnies he had raised against them He also said that he had laid designs against them that were still alive as if they were laying plots for the succes sion and said he how can it be supposed that he who pre pared poison for his father should abstain from mischief as to his brethren He then proceeded to convict him of the attempt to poison Herod and gave an account in order of the several discoveries that had been made and had great indignation as tj the affair of Pheroras because Antipater had been for making him murder his brother and had corrupted those that were dearest to the king and filled the whole palace with wickedness and when he had insisted on many other accusations and the proofs for them he left off 5 Then Varus bid Antipater make his defence but he lay along in silence and said no more but this  God is my witness  that I am entirely innocent So Varus asked for the potion and gave it to be drunk by a condemned malefactor who was then in prison who died upon the spot So Varus when he had had a very private discourse with Herod and had written an account of this assembly to Csesar went away after a days 3 2 WARS OF THE JEWS Book I stay The king also bound Antipater and sent away to inform Caesar of his misfortunes   6 Now after this it was discovered that Antipater had laid a plot against Salome also for one of Antiphilus s domestic servants came and brought letters from Rome from a maid servant of Julia Caesar s wife whose name was Acme By her a message was sent to the king that she had found a let ter written by Salome among Julia s papers and had sent it to him privately out of her good will to him This letter of Sa lome contained the most bitter reproaches of the king and the highest accusations against him Antipater had forged this let ter and had corrupted Acme and persuaded her to send it to Herod This was proved by her letter to Antipater for thus did this woman write to him  As thou desirest I havewrit  ten a letter to thy father and have sent that letter and am  persuaded that the king will not spare his sister when he reads  it Thou wilt do well to remember what thou hast promised  when all is accomplished 7 When this epistle was discovered and what the epistle for ged against Salome contained a suspicion came into the king s mind that perhaps the letters against Alexander were also for ged he was moreover greatly disturbed and in a passion be cause he had almost slain his sister on Antipater s account He did no longer delay therefore to bring him to punishment for all his crimes yet when he was eagerly pursuing Antipater he was restrained by a severe distemper he fell into However he sent an account to Caesar about Acme and the contrivances against Salome he sent also for his testament and altered it and therein made Antipas king as taking no care of Archelaus and Philip because Antipater had blasted their reputations with him  but he bequeathed to Caesar besides other presents that he gave him a thousand talents  as also to his wife and children and friends and freed men about five hundred he also bequeathed to all others a great quantity of land and of money and shewed his respects to Salome his sister by giving her most splendid gifts And this was what was contained in his testament as it was now altered CHAP XXXIII Â The golden eagle is cut to pieces Herod1 s barbarity when he was ready to die He attempts to kill

Charp XXXITI WARS OF THE JEWS 353 fcim in his old age and when he was in a melancholy condition for he was already almost seventy years of age and had been brought low by the calamities that happened to him about his children whereby he had no pleasure in life even when he was in health the grief also that Antipater was still alive aggrava ted his disease whom he resolved to put to death now not at random but as soon as he should be well again and resolved to have him slain in a public manner 2 There ako now happened to him among bis other calami ties a certain popular sedition There were two men of learn ing in the city Jerusalem who were thought the most skilful in the laws of their country and were on that account had in very great esteem all over the nation they were the one Judas the son of Sephoris and the other Matthias the son of Margalus There was a great concourse of the young men to these men when they expounded the laws and there got together every day a kind of an army of such as were growing up to be men Now when these men were informed that the king was wearing away with melancholy and with a distemper they dropped wards to their acquaintance how it was now a very proper time to defend the cause of God and to pull down what had been erected contrary to the laws of their country fer it was unlaw ful there should be any such thing in the temple as images or faces or the like representation of any animal whatsoever Now the king had put up a golden eagle over the great gate of the temple which these learned men exhorted them to cut down and told them that if there should any danger arise it T vas a glo rious thing to die for the laws of their country  because that the soul was immortal and that an eternal enjoyment cf hap piness did await such as died on that account while the mean spirited and those that were not wise enough to shew a right love of their souls preferred a death by a disease before that which is the result of a virtuous behaviour 3 At the same time that these men made thie speech to their disciples a rumour was spread abroad that the king was dying which made the young men set about the work with greater fcoldness  they therefore let themselves down from the top of the temple with thick cords and this at mid day and while a great number of people were in the temple and cut down that golden eagle with axes This was presently told to the king s captain of the temple who came running with a great body of soldiers and caught about forty of the young men and brought them to the king And when he asked them first of all whe ther they had been so hardy as to cut down the golden eagle  they confessed they had done so  and when he as ked them by Vou III v  Y y whose 354 Book I  WARS OF THE JEWS whose command they had done it they replied at the command of the law of their country and when he farther asked them how they could be so joyful when they were to be put todeath they replied Because they should enjoy greater happiness after they were dead 4 At this the king was in such an extravagant passion that he overcame his disease for the time and went out and spake to the people wherein he made a terrible accusation against those men as being guilty of sacrilege and as making greater attempts under pretence of their law and he thought they de served to be punished as impious persons Whereupon the peo ple were afraid lest a great number should be found guilty and desired that when he had first punished those that put them upon this work and then those that were caught in it he would leave off his anger as to the rest With this the king con plied though riot without difficulty and ordered those that had let themselves down together with their Rabbins to be burnt alive but deli vered the rest that were caught to the proper officers to be put to death by them 5 After this the distemper seized upon his whole body and greatly disordered all its parts with various symptoms for there was a gentle fever upon him and an intolerable itching over all the surface of his body and continual pains in his colon and dropsical tumours about his feet and an inflammation of the ab domen and a putrefaction of his privy member that produced worms Besides which he had a difficulty of breathing upon him and could not breathe but when he sat upright and had a convulsion  Since in these two

what he had done to the Rabbins Yet did he struggle with his numerous disor ders and still had a desire to live and hoped for recovery and considered of several methods of cure Accordingly he went over Jordan and made use of those hot baths at Callirhoe whieh ran into the lake Asphaltitis but are themselves sweet enough to be drunk And here the physicians thought proper to bathe his whole body in warm oil by letting it down into a large vessel full of oil whereupon his eyes failed him and he came and went as if he were dying and as a tumult was then made by his servants at their voice he revived again Yet did he after this despair of recovery and gave orders that each sol dier should have fifty drachms a piece and that his comman ders and friends should have great sums of mo ey given them 6 He then returned back and came to Jericho in such a me lancholy state of body as almost threatened him with present death when he proceeded to attempt an horrid wickedness for he got together the most illustrious men of the whole Jewish nation out of every village into a place called the Hippodrome and there shut them in He then called for his sister Salome and her husband Alexas and made this speech to them  I  know well enough that the Jews will keep a festival upon  my death however it is in my power to be mourned for on  other accounts and to havÂ a splendid funeral if you willbe  but subservient to my commands Do you but take care to  send soldiers to encompass these men that are now in custody  and slay them immediately upon my death and then all Ju  dea and every family of them will weep at it whether they  will or no 7 These were the commands he gave them when there came letters from his ambassadors at Rome whereby information was given that Acme was put to death at Caesar s command and that Antipater was condemned to die however they wrote withal that if Herod had a mind rather to banish him Caesar permitted him so to do So he for a little while revived andhad a desire to live but presently after he was overborne by his pains and was disordered by want of food and by a convulsive cough and endeavoured to prevent a natural death so he took an apple and asked for a knife for he used to pare apples and eat them he then looked round about to see that there was nobody to hinder him and lift up his right hand as if he would stab himself but Achiabus his first cousin came running to him andheld his hand and hindered him frotu so doing on which occasion a very great lamentation was made in the palace as if the king were expiring Y r 2 As 56 WARS OF THE JEWS Book 1 As soon as ever Autipater heard that he took courage and with joy in his looks besought his keepers for a sum of money to loose him and let him go but the principal keeper of the prison did not only obstruct him in that his intention but ran and told the king what his design was hereupon the king cried out louder than his distemper would well bear and immediately sent some of his guards and slew Antipater he also gave order to have him buried at Hyrcanium and altered his testament again and therein made Archelaus his eldest son and the bro ther of Antipas his successor and made Antipas tetrarch 8 So Herod having survived the slaughter of his sou five days died having reigned thirty four years since he had caused An tigonus to be slain and obtained his kingdom but thirty seven years since he had been made king by the Romans Now as for his fortune it was prosperous in all other respects if ever any other man could be so since from aprivate man he obtained the kingdom and kept it so long and left it to his own sons  but still in his domestic affairs he was a most unfortunate man Now before the soldiers knew of his death Salome and her hus band came out and dismissed those that were in bonds whom the king had commanded tobe slain and told them that he had alter ed his mind and would have every one of them sent to their own homes When these men were gone Salome told the soldiers the king was dead and got them and the rest of the multitude together to an assembly in the ar phitheatre at Jericho where Ptolemy who was intrusted by the king with his signet ring came before them and spake of the happiness the king had at tained and comforted the multitude and read the epistle which had been left for the soldiers wherein he earnestly exhorted them to bear good will to his successor and after he had read the e pistle he opened and read his testament wherein Philip was to inherit Trachonitis and the neighbouring countries and Antipas was to be tetrarch as we said before and Archelaus was made king He had also been commanded to carry Herod s ring to Caesar andthe settlements he had made sealed up because Caesar was to be lord of all the settlements he had made and was to con firm his testament and he ordered that the dispositions he had made were to be kept as they were in his former testament 9 So there was an acclamation made to Archelaus to congra tulate him upon his advancement and the soldiers with the mul titude went round about in troops and promised him their good will and besides prayed God to bless his government After this they betook shemselves to prepare for the king s funeral and Archelaus omitted othing of magnificence therein but brought out all the royal ornaments to augment the pomp of the deceased Chap XXXIII WARS OF THE JEWS 357 deceased There was a bier all of gold embroidered with pre cious stones and a purple bed of various contexture with the dead body upon it covered with purple and a diadem was put upon his head and a crown of gold above it and a sceptre in his right hand and near to the bier were Herod s sons and a multitude of his kindred next to which came his guards and the regiment of Thracians the Germans also and Galls all ac coutered as if they were going to war but the rest of the ar my went foremost armed and following their captains and offi cers in a regular manner after whom five hundred of his do mestic servants and freed men followed with sweet spices in their hands and the body was carried two hundred furlongs to Herodium where he had given order to be buried And this shall suffice

of them Â 1 VTOW the necessity which Archelaus was under of ta X king a journey to Rome was the occasion of new dis turbances for when he had mourned for his father seven days and had given a very expensive funeral feast to the multitude which custom is the occasion of poverty to many of the Jews because they are forced to feast the multitude for if any one omits it he is not esteemed an holy person he put on a white garment and went up to the temple where the people accosted him with various acclamations He also spake kindly to the multitude from an elevated sear and a throne of gold and re turned them thanks for the zeal they had shewn about his father s funeral and the submission they had made to him as if he were already settled in the kingdom  but he told them withal that  he would not at present take upon him  either the authority of a king or the names thereto belong  ing until Caesar who is made lord of this whole affair by the  testament confirm the succession for that when the soldiers  would have set the diadem on his head at Jericho he would  not accept of it but that he would make abundant requitals  not to the soldiers only but to the people for their alacrity and good will to him when the superior lords the Romans  should have given him a complete title to the kingdom for  that it should be his study to appear in all things better than  his father 2 Upon  Hear Dean Aldrich s note on this place  The law or custom of the Jews  says hp requires seven days mourning for the dead Antiq B XVli ch viii  sect iv Vul III Whence the author of the book of Ecclesiasticus ch xxii x x u assigns seven days a the proper time of mourning for the dead and ch xxxviii  17 enjoins men to mourn for the dead that they may not be evil spoken of  for as Josephus says pretently if any one omits this mourning funeral feast  he is not esteemed an holy person Now it is certain that such a seven days  mourning has been cus omary from times of the greatest antiquity Gen J 10  Funeral feasts are also mentioned as of a considerable antiquity Ezek xxiv 17 â Jer xvi 7 Prov xxxi 6 Deut iavi 14 Josephus Of the War B III ch ix  sect  VoL HI Chap I WARS Â F THE JEWS 359 2 Upon this the multitude were pleased and presently made 9 trial of what he intended by asking great things of him for some made a clamour that he would ease them in their taxes others that he would take off the duties upon commodities and some that he would loose those that were in prison in all which cases he answered readily to their satisfaction in order to get the good will of the multitude after which he offered the pro per sacrifices and feasted with his friends And here it was that a great many of those that desired innovations came in crowds towards the evening and began then to mourn on their own account when the public mourning for the king was over These lamented those that were put to death by Herod because they had cut down the golden eagle that had been over the gate of the temple Nor was this mourning of a private nature but the lamentations were very great the mourning solemn and the weeping such as was loudly heard all over the city as being for those men who had perished for the laws of their country and for the temple They cried out that a punishment ought to be inflicted for these men upon those that were honoured by Herod and that in the first place the man whom he had made high priest should be deprived and that it was fit to choose a person of greater piety and purity than he was 3 At these clamours Archelaus was provoked but restrained himself from taking vengeance on the authors on account of the haste he was in of going to Rome as fearing lest upon his mak ing war on the multitude such an action might detain him at home Accordingly he made trial to quiet the innovators by persuasion rather than by force and sent his general in a pri vate way to them and by him exhorted them to be quiet But the seditious threw stones at him and drove him away as he came into the temple and before he could say any thing to them The like treatment they shewed to others who came to them after him many of which were sent by Archelaus in order to reduce them to sobriety andthese answered still on all occasions after a passionate manner and it openly appeared that they would not be quiet if their numbers were but considerable And indeed at the feast of unleavened bread which was now at hand and is by the Jews called the Passover and used to be celebrated with a great number of sacrifices an innumerable multitude of the people came out of the country to worship some of these stood in the temple bewailing the Rabbins that had been put to death J and procured their sustenance by beg ging in order to support their sedition At this Archelaus was affrighted and privately sent a tribune with his cohort of sol diers upon them before the disease should spread over the whole 360 wars or the jews Book II whole multitude and gave orders that they should constrain those that began the tumult by force to be quiet At these the whole multitude were irritated and threw stones at many of the soldiers and killed them  but the tribune fled away wounded and had much ado to escape so After which they betook themselves to their sacrifices as if they had done no mis  chief nor did it appear to Archelaus that the multitude could be restrained without bloodshed so he sent his whole army up on them the footmen in great multitudes by the way of the city and the horsemen by the way of the plain who falling upon them on the sudden as they were offering their sacrifices destroyed about three thousand of them but the rest of the multitude were dispersed upon the adjoining mountains these were followed by Archelaus s heralds who commanded every one to retire to their own homes whither they all went and left the festival CHAP II Archelaus goes to Rome with a great number of his kindred He is there accused before C esar by Antipater  but is superior to his accusers in judgment by the means of that defence which Nicolaus made for him f 1  RCHELAUS went down now to the sea side with JTjl his mother and his friends Poplas and Ptolemy and Nicolaus and left behind him Philip to be his steward in the palace and to take care of his domestic affairs Salome went also along with him with her sons as did also the king s brethren and sons in law These in appearance went to give him all the assistance they were able in order to secure his  succession but in reality to accuse him for his breach of the laws by what he had done at the temple 2 But as they were come to Cesarea Sabinus the procura tor of Syria met them he was going up to Judea to secure Herod s effects but Varus president of Syria who was come thither restrained him from going any farther This Varus Archelaus had sent for by the earnest entreaty of Ptolemy At this time indeed Sabinus to gratify Varus neither went to the citadels nor did he shut up the treasuries where his father s mo ney was laid up but promised that he would lie still until Caesar should have taken cognisance of the affair So he abode at Cesarea but as soon as those that were his hindrance were gone when Varus was gone to Antioch and Archelaus was sailed to Rome he immediately went on to Jerusalem and seized upon the palace And when he had called for the go vernors of the citadels and the Stewards of the king s private affairs Chap It WARS OF THE JEWS 3di affairs he tried to sift out the accounts of the money and to take possession of the citadels But the governors of those cita dels were not unmindful of the commands laid upon them by Archelaus and continued to guard them and said the custody of them rather belonged to Caesar than to Archelaus 3 In the mean time Antipas went also to Rome to strive for the kingdom and to insist that the former testament wherein he was named to be king was valid before the latter testa ment Salome had also promised to assist him as had many of Archelaus s kindred who sailed along with Archelaus himself also He also carried along with him his mother and Ptolemy the brother of Nicolaus who seemed one of great weight on account of the great trust Herod put in him he having been one of his most honoured friends However Antipas depended chiefly uponlreneus the orator upon whose authority he had rejected such as advised him to yield to Archelaus because he was his elder brother and because the second testament gave the kingdom to him The inclinations also of all Archelaus s kindred who hated him were removed to Antipas when they came to Rome although in the first place every one rather de sired to live under their own laws without a king and to be under a Roman governor but if they should fail in thatpoint these desired that Antipas might be their king 4 Sabinus did also afford these his assistance to the same purpose by the letters he sent wherein he accused Archelaus before Caesar and highly commended Antipas Salome also and those with her put the crimes which they accused Arche laus of in order and put them into Caesar s hands and after they had done that Archelaus xyrote down the reasons of his claim and by Ptolemy sent in his fathers ring and his father s accounts And when Caesar had maturely weighed by himself what both had to alledge for themselves as also had considered of the great burden of the kingdom and largeness of the reve fiues and withal the number of the children Herod had left be i hind him and had moreover read the letters he had received from Varus and Sabinus on this occasion he assembled the principal persons among the Romans together in which as sembly Caius the son of Agrippa and his daughter Julias but by himself adopted for his own son sat in the first seat and gave the pleaders leave to speak 5 Then stood up Salome s son Antipaterj Vho of all Ar chtlaus s antagonists was the shrewdest pleader and accused him in the following speech  That Archelaus did in words  contend for the kingdom but that in deeds he had long exer a  cised royal authority and so did but insult Gaesar in desiring VOL JIL  Z L to 302 WARS OT THE JEWS Book If  to be now heard on that account since he had not staid for  his determination about the succession and since he had sub  orned certain persons after Herod s death to move for put  ting the diadem upon his head since he had set himself down  in the throne and given answers as a king and altered the Â disposition of the army and granted to some higher dignities Â that he had also complied in all things with the people in the  requests they had made to him as to their king and had also  dismissed those that had been put into bonds by his father  for most important reasons Now after all this he desires Â the shadow of that royal authority whose substance he had al  ready seized to himself and so hath made Caesar lord not of  things but of words He also reproached him farther that  his mourning for his father was only pretended while he put  on a sad countenance in the day time but drank to great ex Â cess in the night from which behaviour he said the late  disturbance among the multitude came while they had an in  dignation thereat And indeed the purport of his whole dis  course was to aggravate Archelaus s crime in slaying such a  multitude about the temple which multitude came to the fes  tival but were barbarously slain in the midst of their own sa  crifices and he said there was such a vast number of dead  bodies heaped together in the temple as even a foreign war that should come upon them suddenly before it vras de nounced could not have heaped together And he added that it was thefore sight his father had of that his barbarity which made him never give him any hopes of the kingdom but when his mind was more infirm than his body and he  was not able to reason soulidly and did not well know what  was the character of that son whom in his second testament Â Â he made his successor and this was done by him at a time Â Â when he had no complaints to make of him whom he had Â Â named before when he was sound in body and when his mind Â was free from all passion That however if any one should Â Â suppose Herod s judgment when he was sick was superior  to that at another time yet had Archelaus forfeited his  kingdom by his own behaviour and those his actions which  were contrary to the law and to its disadvantage Or what  sort of a kingwill this man be when he hath obtained the  government from Caesar who hath slain so many before he  hath obtained it 6 When Antipater had spoken largely to this purpose and had produced a great number of Archelaus s kindred as witnes ses to prove every part of the accusation he endedhis discourse Then stood up Nicolaus to plead for Arehelaus He alleged V That Chap Ilf WARS OF THE JEWS S6S That  the slaughter in the temple could not be avoided that  those that were slain were become enemies not to Archelaus s â kingdom only but to Caesar who was to determine about  him He also demonstrated that Archelaus s accusers had  advised him to perpetrate other things of which he might  have been accused But he insisted that the latter testament  should for this reason above all others be esteemed valid be  cause Herod had therein appointed Caesar to be the person  who should confirm the succession for he who shewed such  prudence as to recede from his own power and yield it up to the lord of the world cannot be supposed mistaken in his  judgment about him that was to be his heir  and he that so  well knew whom to choose for arbitrator of the succession  could not be unacquainted with him whom he chose for his  successor 7 When Nicolaus had gone through all he had to say Ar chelaus came and fell down before Caesar s knees without any noise Upon which he raised him up after a very obliging manner and declared that truly he was worthy to succeed his father However he still made no firm determination in his case  but when he had dismissed those assessors that had been with him that day he deliberated by himself about the allega tions which he had heard whether it were fit to constitute any of those named in the testaments for Herod s successor or whe ther the government should be parted among all his posterity and this because of the number of those that seemed to stand in need of support therefrom

fell sick and died Letters also were brought out of Syria from Varus about a revolt of the Jews This was foreseen by Varus who accordingly after Archelaus was sailed went up to Jerusalem to restrain the promoters of the sedition since it was manifest that the nation would not be at rest so he left one of those le gions which he brought with him out of Syria in the city and went himself to Antioch But Sabinus came after he was gone and gave them an occasion of making innovations  for he compelled the keepers of the citadels to deliver them up to him and made a bitter search after the king s money as depending aot only oa the soldiers which were left by Varus but on the Z z 2 multitude 364 Book II WARS OF THE JEWS multitude of his own servants all which he armed and used as the instruments of hiscovetousness Nowwhenthat feast which was observed after seven weeks and which the Jews call Pente cost i e the 50th day was at hand its name being takeufrom the number of the days after the passover the people got to gether but not on account of the accustomed divine worship but of the indignation they had at the present state of affairs Wherefore an immense multitude ran together out of Galilee and Idumea and Jericho and Perea that was beyond Jordan  but the people that naturally belonged to Judea itself were above the rest both in number and in the alacrity of the men So they distributed themselves into three parts and pitched their camps in three places one at the north side of the temple ano ther at the south side by the Hippodrome and the third part were at the palace on the west So they lay round about the Romans on every side and besieged them 2 Now Sabinus was affrighted both at the multitude and at their courage and sent messengers to Varus continually and besought him to come to his succour quickly for that if he delayed his legion would be cut to pieces As for Sabinus himself he got up to the highest tower of the fortress which was ealled Phasaelus it is of the same name with Herod s brother who was destroyed by the Parthians and then he made signs to the soldiers of that legion to attack the enemy for his astonishment was so great that he durst not go down to his own men Hereupon the soldiers were prevailed upon and leaped out into the temple and fought a terrible battle with the Jews in which while there were none over their heads to distress thero they were too hard for them by their skill and the others want of skill in war but when once many of the Jews had gotten up to the tqp of the cloisters and threw their darts downwards upon the heads qf the Romans there were a great many of them destroyed Nor was it easy to avenge them Selves upon those that threw their weapons from on high nor Was it more easy for them to suitain those who came to fight them hand to hand 9 Since therefore the Romans were sorely afflicted by both these circumstances they set fire to the cloisters which were works to be admired both on account of their magnitude and costliness Whereupon those that were above them were pre sently encompassed with the flame and many of them perished therein as many of them also were destroyed by the enemy who came suddenly upon them some of them also threw them selves down from the walls backward and some there were Who from the desperate condition they were in prevented the Chap IV WA S OF THE JEW SS5 fire by killing themselves with their own swords  but so many of them as crept out from the walls and came upon the Romans were easily mastered by them by reason of the astonishment they were under  until at last some of the Jews being destroyed and others dispersed by the terror they were ii the soldiers fell upon the treasure of God which was now deserted and plun dered about four hundred talents of which sum Sabinus got together all that was not carried away by the soldiers 4 However this destructionof the works about the temple and of the men occasioned a much greater number and those of a more warlike sort to get together to oppose the Romans These encompassed the palace round and threatened to destroy all that were in it unless they went their ways quickly for they promised that Sabinus should come to no harm if he would go out with his legion There were also a great many of the king s party who deserted to the Romans and assisted the Jews yet did the most warlike body of them all who were three thou sand of the men of Sebaste go over to the Romans Rufus also and Gratus their captains did the same Gratus having the foot of the king s party under him and Rufus the horse each of whom even without the forces under them were of great weight on account of their strength and wisdom which turn the scales in war Now the Jews persevered in the siege and tried to break down the walls of the fortress and cried out to Sabinus and his party That they should go their ways and not prove an hinderance to them now they hoped after a long time to reco ver that ancient liberty which their forefathers had enjoyed Sa binus indeed was well contented to get out of the danger he was in but he distrusted the assurances the Jews gave him and sus pected such gentle treatment was but a bait laid as a snare for them this consideration together with the hopes he had of succour from Varus made him bear the siege still longer CHAP IV Herod s veteran soldiers become tumultuous The robberies of Jtidas Simon and Atbrongeus take the name of king upon tlem Â 1 A T this time there were great disturbances in the coun J JL try and that in many places  and the opportunity that now offered itself induced a great many to set up for kings And indeed in Idumea two thousand of Herod s veteran soldiers got together and armed themselves and fought against those of the king s party against whom Achiabus the king s first com sin fought and that out of some of the places that we e the most strongly 365 WARS OF THE JEWS Book II  strongly fortified but so as to a void a direct conflict with them in the plains In Sepphoris also a city of Galilee there was one Judas the son of that arch robber Hezekias who formerly over ran the country and had been subdued by king Herod this tnan got no small multitude together and brake open the place where the royal armour was laid up and armed those about him and attacked those that were so earnest to gain the dominion 2 In Perea also Simon one of the servants to the king re lying upon the handsome appearance and lallness of his body put a diadem upon his own head also he also went about with a cornpany of robbers that he had gotten together and burnt down the royal palace that was at Jericho and many other costly edifices besides and procuredhimself very easily spoils by rapine as snatching them out of the fire And he had soon burnt down all the fine edifices if Gratus the captain of the foot of the king s party had not taken the Trachonite archers and the most war like of Sebaste and met the man His footmen were slain in the battle in abundance Gratus also cut to pieces Simon himself as he was flying along a strait valley when he gave him an oblique Stroke upon his neck as he ran away and brake it The royal palaces that were near Jordan at Betharamptha were also burnt down by some other of the seditious that came out of Perea 3 At this time it was that a certain shepherd ventured to set iiimself up for a king he was called Atbrongeus It was his Strength of body that made him expect such a dignity as well as his soul which despised death and besides these qualifications he had four brethren like himself He put a troop of armed men under each of these his brethren and made use of them as his ge nerals and commanders when he made his incursions while he did himself act like a king and meddled only with the more im portant affairs and at this time he put a diadem about his head and continued after that to over run the Country for no little time with his brethren and became their leader in killing both the Romans and those of the king s party nor did any Jew escape him if any gain could accrue to him thereby He once ventured to encompass a whole troop of Romans at Emniaus who were carrying corn and weapons to their legion his men therefore shot their arrows and darts and thereby slew their cen turion Arius and forty of the stoutestof his men whilethe restof them who were indanger of the same fate upon the coming of Gra tus with those of Sebaste to their assistance escaped And when these men had thus served both theirown countrymen andforeign crs and thatthrough this whole war threeof them were aftersome time subdued the eldest by Archelaus the two next by falling into the hands of Gratus and Ptolemeus but the fourth deli vered Chap V WARS OF THE JEWS 3 n vered himself up to Archelaus upon his giving him his right hand for his security However this their end was not till after ward while at present they filled all Judea with a piratic war CHAP V Varus composes tbt tumults in Judea and crucifies about two thousand of the seditious j 1 T 7 PON Varus s reception of the letters that were written V by Sabinus and the captains he could not avoid being afraid for the whole legion he had left there So he made haste to their relief and took with him the other two legions with the four troops of horsemen to them belonging and inarch ed to Ptolemais having given orders for the auxiliaries that were sent by jhe kings and governors of cities to meethim there Moreover he received from the people of Berytus as he pas sed through their city fifteen hundred armed men Now as soon as the other body of auxiliaries were come to Ptolemais as well as Aretas the Arabian who out of the hatred he bore to Herod brought a great army of horse and foot Varus sent a part of his army presently to Galilee which lay near to Ptolemais and Caius one of his friends for their captain This Cains put those that met him to flight and took the city Sep phoris and burnt it and made slaves of its inhabitants but as for Varus himself he marched to Samaria with his whole army where he did not meddle with the city itself because he found that it had made no commotion during these troubles but pitch ed his camp about a certain village which was called Arut It belonged to Ptolemy and on that account was plundered by the Arabians who were very angry even at Herod s friends also He thence marched on to the village Sampho another fortified place which they plundered as they had done the other As they carried off all the money they light upon belonging to the public revenues all was now full of fire and bloodshed and no thing could resist the plunders of the Arabians Emmaus was also burnt upon the flight of its inhabitants and this at the com mand of Varus out of his rage at the slaughter of those that were about Arius 2 Thence he marched on to Jerusalem and as soon as he was but seen by the Jews he made their camps disperse themselves they also went away and fled up and down the country but the citizens received him and cleared themselves of having any hand in this revolt and said that they had raised no commotions but had only been forced to admit the multitude because of the festival and that they were rather besieged together with the Romans 363 WARS or THE JEWS Book II Romans than assisted those that had revolted There had be fore this met him Joseph the first cousin of Archelaus and Gratus together with Rufus who led those of Sebaste as well as the king s army there also met him those of the Roman le gion armed after their accustomed manner for as to Sabinus he durst not come into Varus s sight but was gone out of the city before this to the sen side but Varus sent a part of his army into the country against those that had been the authors of this commotion and as they caught great numbers of them those that appeared to have been the least concerned in these tu mult he put into custody but such as were the most guilty he crucified these were in number about two thousand 3 He was also informed that there continued in Idumeaten thousand men still in arms but when he found that the Ara bians did not act like auxiliaries but managed the war accord ing to their own passions and did mischief to the country other wise than he intended and this out of their hatred to Herod he sent them away but made haste with his own legions to march against those that had revolted but these by the advice of Achiabus delivered themselves up to him before it came to a battle Then did Varus forgive the multitude their offences but sent their captains to Caesar to be examined by him Now Caesar forgave the rest but gave orders that certain of the king s relations for some of those that were among them who were Herod s kinsmen should be put to death because they had engaged in a war against a king of their own family When therefore Varus had settled matters at Jerusalem after this manner and had left the former legion there as a garrison he returned to Antioch CHAP VI The Jews greatly complain of Archelaus and desirf flat tley may be made subject to Roman governors But when Ccesar had heard what they had to say he distributed Herod s do minions among his sons according to his own pleasure j 1 TJUT now came another accusation from the Jews against t Archelaus at Rome which he was to answer to It was made by those ambassadors who before the revolt had come by Varus s permission to plead for the liberty of their country those that came were fifty in number but there were more than eight thousand of the Jews at Rome who supported them And when Caesar had assembled a council of the prin cipal Romans in  Apollo s temple that was in the palace this was  This holding a council in the temple of Apollo in the mperer s pake at Rome by Augustus and even the building of this temple magnificently by him self in that palace Â re exactly agreeable to Augustus in his elder years as Aldiiieh and Srauhci il observe and prove frosn Suetonius and Propenius Ghap V WARS OF THE JEWS 360 was what he had himself built and adorned at a vast expence the multitude of the Jews stood with the ambassadors and on the other side stood Archelaus with his friends but as for thfe kindred of Archelaus they stood on neither side for to stand on Archelaus a side their hatred to him and envy at him would not give them leave while yet they were afraid to be seen by Caesar with his accusers Besides these there were present Archelaus s brother Philip being sent thither befoffe hand out of kindness by Varus for two reasons  the one was this that he might be assisting to Archelaus and the other was this that in case Caesar should make a distribution of what He rod possessed among his posterity he might obtain some share of it 2 And now upon the permission that was given the accusers to speak they in the first place went over Herod s breaches of their law and said That  he was not a king but the most  barbarous of all tyrants and that they had found him to be  such by the sufferings they underwent from him that when a  very great number had been slain by him those that were  left had endured such miseries that they called those that  were dead happy men that he had not only tortured the bodies  of his subjects but entire cities and had done much harm to  the cities of his own country while he adorned those that be  longed to foreigners and he shed the blood of Jews in order  to do kindness to those people that were out of their bounds  that he had filled the nation full of poverty and of the greatest  iniquity instead of that happiness and those laws which they  had anciently enjoyed that in short the Jews had borne  more calamities from Herod in a few years than had their  forefathers during all that interval of time that had passed  since they had come out of Babylon and returned home ih the  reign of  Xerxes that however the nation was come to so  low a condition by being inured to hardships that they sub  mittedto his sncesso r of their own accord though he brought  themintobitterslavery thata ccordinglytheyreadilycalledAr  chelaus though he was the son of so great a tyrant king after Â the decease of his father and joined with him in mourning fo  the death of Herod and in wishing him good success in that his  succession while yet this Archelaus lest he should be in dan Â  ger of not being thought the genuine son of Herod began his  reign with the murder of three thousand citizens as if he had Â a mind to offer so many bloody sacrifices to God for his go  vemment and to fill the temple with the like nurftber of dead  bodies  H re we hava a strong confirmation that it was Xerxes and not Artaxerte under whom the main part of the Jews returned out of the Babylonian captivity i e in the days of Ezra and Nehemiah The same thing ii in the Antiquities B XI chap v sect i Vol II VOL III 3 A 37fl WARS OF THE JEWS Book IT  bodies at that festival that however those tliat were left af  ter so many miseries had just reason to consider now at last  the calamities they had undergone and to oppose themselves  like soldiers in war to receive those stripes upon their faces 1 but not upon their backs as hitherto Whereupon they  prayed that the Romans would have compassion upon the poor  remains of Judea and not expose what was left of them to Â such as barbarously tore them to pieces and that they would  join their country to Syria and administer the government  by their own commanders whereby it would soon be de  monstrated that those who arc under the calumny of seditious  persons and lovers of war know how to bear governors that  are set over them if thev be but tolerable ones So the Jews concluded their accusation with this request Then rose up Nicolaus and confuted the accusations which were brought a gainst the kings and himself accused the Jewish nation as hard to be ruled and as naturally disobedient to kings He also re proached all those kinsmen of Archelaus who had left him and were gone over to his accusers 3 SoC esar after he had heard both sides dissolved the assem bly for that time but a few days afterward he gave the one half of Herod s kingdom to Archelaus by the name of Etbnarcb and promised to make him king also afterward if he rendered himself worthy of that dignity But as to the other half he di vided it into two tetrarchies and gave them to two other sons of Herod the one of them to Philip and the other to that Antipas who contested the kingdom with Archelaus Under this last was Perea and Galilee with a revenue of two hundred talents but Batanea and Trachonitis and Auranitis and certain parts of Zeno s house about Jamnia with a revenue of an hundred ta lents were made subject to Philip j while Idume and all Ju dea and Samaria were parts of the ethnarchy of Archelaus al though Samaria was eased of one quarter of its taxes out of re gard to their not having revolted with the rest of the nation He also made subject to him the following cities viz Strato s Tower and Sebaste and Joppa and Jerusalem but as to the Grecian cities Gaza and Gadara and Hippos he cut them off from the kingdom and added them to Syria Now the revenue of the country that was given to Archelaus was four hundred talents Salome also besides what the king had left her in his testaments was now made mistress of Jamnia and Ashdod and Phasaelis Caesar did moreoverbestow uponher the royal palace of Ascalon by all which she got together a revenue of sixty ta lents buthe put her house under the ethnarchyof Archelaus And for the rest of Herod s offspring they received what was be queathed Chap VII  WARS or THE JEWS 371 queathed to them in his testaments but besides that Caesar granted to Herod s two virgin daughters five hundred thousand drachmae of silver and gave them in marriage to the sons of Fheroras but after this family distribution he gave be tween them what had been bequeathed to him by Herod which was a thousand talents reserving to himself only some inconsi derable presents in honour of the deceased CHAP VII The history of the spurious Alexander Archelaus is banished and Glaphyra dies after what was to happen to both of them had been shewed them in dreams f 1 TN the mean time there was a man who was by birth a X Jew but brought up at Sidon with one of the Roman freed men who falsely pretended on account of the resemblance of their countenances that he was that Alexander who was slain by Herod This man came to Rome in hopes of not being de tected He had one who was his assistant of his own nation and who knew all the affairs of the kingdom and instructed him to say how those that were sent to kill him and Aristobulus had pity upon them and stole them away by putting bodies that were like theirs in their places This man deceived the Jews that were at Crete and got a great deal of money of them for travelling in splendour and thence sailed to Melos where he was thought so certainly genuine that he got a great deal more mo ney and prevailed with those that had treated him to sail along with him to Rome So he landed at Dicearchia Piiteoii and got very large presents from the Jews who dwelt there and was conducted by his father s friends as if he were a king nay the resemblance ia his countenance procured him so much credit that those who had seen Alexander and had known him very well would take their oaths that he was the very same person Accordingly the whole body of the Jews that were atRome ran out in crowds to see him and an innumerable multitude there was which stood in the narrow places through which he was carried for those of Melos were so far distracted that they carried him in a sedan and maintained a royal attendance for him at their own proper charges 2 But Caesar who knew perfectly well the lineaments of Alexander s face because he had been accused by Herod before him discerned the fallacy in his countenance even before he saw the man However he suffered the agreeable fame that went of him to have some weight with him and sent Celedus one who well knew Alexander and ordered him to bring the young 3 A 2 map 372 Book II WARS OF THE JEWS man to him But when Caesar saw him he immediately dis cerned a difference in his countenance and when he had discover ed that his whole body was of a more robust texture and like that of a slave he understood the whole was a contrivance But the impudence of what hesaid greatly provoked him to be angry at him for when he was asked about Aristobulus he said That  he was also preserved alive and was left on purpose in Cy  prus for fear of treachery because it would be harder for  plotters to get them both into their power while they were  separate Then did Caesar take him by himself privately arid said tp him I will give thee thy life if thou wilt discover f who it was that persuaded thee to forge such stories So he said that he would discover him and followed Caesar and point ed to that Jew who abused the resemblance of his face to get money for that he had received more presents in every city than ever Alexander did when he was alive Caesar laughed at the contrivance and put this spurious Alexander among his rowers on account of the strength of his body but ordered him that persuaded him to be put to death But for the people of Melos they had been sufficiently punished for their folly by the expences they had been at on his account 3 And now Archelaus took possession of his ethnarchy and used not the Jews only but the Samaritans also barbarously and this out of his resentment of their old quarrels with him Whereupon they both of them sent ambassadors against him to Caesar and in the ninth year of his government he was banished to Vienna a city of Gaul and his effects were put into Caesar s treasury But the report goes that before he was sent for by Caesar he seemed to see nine ears of corn full and large but de voured by oxen When therefore he had sent for the diviners and some of the Chaldeans and inquired of them what they thought it portended and when one of them had one interpreta tion and another had another Simon one of the sect of the EsT sens said That t he thought the ears of corn denoted years and  the oxen denoted a mutation of things because by their  ploughing they made an alteration of the country That f therefore he should feign as many years as there were ears of  corn and after he had passed through various alterations of f fortune should die 1 Now five days after Archelaus had heard this interpretation he was called to his trial 4 I cannot also but think it worthy to be recorded what dream Glaphyra the daughter of Archelaus king of Cappado cia had who had at first been wife to Alexander who was the brother of Archelaus concerning whom we have been discoursing This Alexander was the son of Herod the king by whom he Chap VIII WARS OF THE JEWS 313 was put to death as we have already related This Gkphyra was married after his death to Juba king of Lybia and af ter his death was returned home and lived a widow with her father Then it was that Archelaus the ethnarch saw her and fell so deeply in love with her that he divorced Mariamne who was then his wife and married her When therefore she was come into Judea and had been there for a little while she thought she saw Alexander stand by her and that he said to her  Thy marriage with the king of Lybia might have been  sufficient for thee but thou was not contented with him  but art returned again to my family to a third husband and  him thou impudent woman hast thou chosen for thine hus  band who is my brother However I shall not overlook  the injury thou hast offered me I shall soon have thee  again whether thou wilt or no Now Glaphyra hardly sur vived the narration of this dream of her s two days  CHAP VIII Archelaus s etinarchy is reduced into a Roman province The sedition of Judas of Galilee The three sects of the Jeias f 1 A ND now Archelaus s part of Judea was reduced into a i V province and Coponius one of the equestrian order among the Romans was sent as a procurator having the power of life and death put into his hands by Caesar Under his ad ministration it was that a certain Galilean whose name was Judas prevailed with his countrymen to revolt and said they were cowards if they would endure to pay a tax to the Romans and would after God submit to mortal men as their lords This man was a teacher of a peculiar sect of his own and was not at all like the rest of those their leaders 2 For there are three philosophical sects among the Jews The followers of the first of which are the Pharisees of the se cond the Sadducees and the third sect which pretends to a se verer discipline are called Essens These last are Jews by birth and seem to have a greater affection for one another than the other sects have I hese Essens reject pleasures as an evil but esteem continence and the conquest over our passions to be vir tue They neglect wedlock but choose out other persons chil dren while they are pliable and fit for learning and esteem them to be of their kindred and form them according to their own manners They do not absolutely deny the fitness of mar riage and the succession of mankind thereby continued bat they guard against the lascivious behaviour of women and are persuaded that none of them preserve their fidelity to one man Â 3 These 374 WARS OF THE JEWS Book II 3 These men are despisers of riches and so very communi cative as raises our admiration Nor is there any one to be found among them who hath more than another for it is a law among them that those who come to them must let what they have be common to the whole order insomuch that among them all there is no appearance of poverty or excess of riches but every one s possessions are intermingled with every other s pos sessions and so there is as it were one patrimony among all the brethren They think that oil is a defilement and if any one of them be anointed without his own approbation it is wiped off his body for they think to be sweaty is a good thing as they do also to be clothed in white garments They also have stewards appointed to take care of their common affairs who every one of them have no separate business for any but what is for the uses of them all 4 They have no one certain city but many of them dwell in every city and if any of their sect come from other places what they have lies open for them just as if it were their own and they go into such as they never knew before as if they had been ever so long acquainted with them For which reason they carry nothing at all with them when theytravel into remote parts though still they take their weapons with them for fear of thieves Accordingly there is in every city where they live one appointed particularly to take care of strangers and to pro vide garments and other necessaries for them But the habit and management of their bodies is such as children use who are in fear of their masters Nor do they allow of the change of garments or of shoes till they be first entirely torn to pieces or worn out by time Nor do they either buy or sell any thing to one another but every one of them gives what he hath to him that wanteth it and receives from him again in lieu of it what may be convenient for himself and although there be no icquittal made they are fully allowed to take what they want of whomsoever they please  5 And as for their piety towards God it is very extraordi nary for before sun rising they speak not a word about profane matters but put up certain prayers which they have received from their forefathers as if they made a supplication for its ri sing After this every one of them are sent away by their cura tors to exercise some of thoce arts wherein they are skilled in which they labour with great diligence till the fifth hour  Af ter which they assemble themselves together again into one place and when they have clothed themselves in whits veils they then bathe their bodies in cold water And aitcv this purification is ever they every one meet together in an apartment of their own into Chap VIII WARS or THE JEWS 373 into which it is not permitted to any of another sect to enter while they go after a pure manner into the dining room as in to a certain holy temple and quietly set themselves down up on which the baker lays them loaves in order the cook also brings a single plate of one sort of food and sets it before every one of them but a priest says grace before meat and it is un lawful for any one to taste of the food before grace be said The same priest when he hath dined says grace again after meat and when they begin and when they end they praise God as he that bestows their food upon them after which they lay aside their white garments and betake themselves to their la bours again till the evening then they return home to supper after the same manner and if there be any strangers there they sit down with them Nor is there ever any clamour or distur bance to pollute their house but they give every one leave to speak in their turn which silence thus kept in their house ap pears to foreigners like some tremendous mystery the cause of which is that perpetual sobriety they exercise and the same set tled measure of meat and drink that is allotted them and that such as is abundantly sufficient for them 6 And truly as for other things they do nothing but accord ing to the injunctions of their curators only these two things are done among them at every one s own free will which are to assist those that want it and to shew mercy for they are per mitted of their own accord to afford succour to such as deserve it when they stand in need of it and to bestow food on those that are in distress but they cannot give any thing to their kin dred without the curators They dispense their anger after a just manner and restrain their passion They are eminent for fidelity and are the ministers of peace whatsoever they say al so is firmer than an oath but swearing is avoided by them and they esteem it  worse than perjury for they say that he who cannot be believed without swearing by God is already condemned  This practice of the Essens in refusing to siviar and esteeming rwtaring on ordinary occasions worse than perjury is delivered here in general words as are the parallel injunctions of our Saviour Matt vi 34 xxiii 16 and of St lames v II but all admit of particular exceptions for solemn causes and on great and ne cessary occasions Thus these very Essens who here do so zealously avoid swear ing are related in the very next sec ion to admit none till they take tremtndaut catbt to perform their several duties to God and to their neigh our without sup posing they thereby break this rule not to swear at all The case is the same in Christianity as we learn from the Apostolical Constitutions which although they agree with Christ and St James in forbidding to swear in general ch v II ch vi 23 yet do they explain it elsewhere by avoiding to  swear falsely and to swear  often and in vain ch ii 36 and again by  not swearing at all but withal adding that  if that cannot be avoided to swear truly ch vii 3 which abun dantly explain to us the nature of the measures of this general injunction wars or the jews Book II condemed They also take great pains in studying the writings of the ancients and choose out of them what is most for the advantage of their soul and body and they enquire after such roots and medicinal stones as may cure their distempers 7 But now if any one hath a mind to come over to their sect he is not immediately admitted but he is prescribed the same method of living which they use for a year while he con tinues excluded and they give him also a small hatchet and the forementioned girdle and the white garment And when he hath given evidence during that time that he can observe their continence he approaches nearer to their way of living and is made a partaker of the waters of purification yet is he not even now admitted to live with them for after this demonstration of his fortitude his temper is tried two more years and if he ap pear to be worthy they then admit him into their society And before he is allowed to touch their common food he is obliged to take tremendous oaths that in the first place he will exercise piety towards God and then that he will observe justice towards men and that he will do no harm to any one either of his own accord or by the command of others that he will always hate the wicked and be assistant to tbe righteous that he will evei shew fidelity to all men and especially to those in authority  because no one obtainsthe government without God s assistance and that ifhebein authority he will at no time whatever abuse his authority nor endeavour to outshine his subjects either in his garments or any other finery that he will be perpetually a lover of truth and propose to himself to reprove those that tell lies that he will keep his hands clear from theft and his soul from unlawful gains and that he will neither conceal any thing from those of his own sect nor discover any of their doc trines to others no not though any one should compel him so to do at the hazard of his life Moreover he swears to com municate their doctrines to no one any otherwise than as he re ceived them himself that he will abstain from robbery and will equally preserve the books belonging to their sect and the names of the  angels or messengers These are the oaths by which they secure their proselytes to themselves 8 But Â This mention of the nanus vf angds so particularly preserved hir the Essens If it means more than those messengers which were employed to bring them the peculiar books of their sect looks iilce a prelude to that warsbiffing of angels blamed by St Paul as superstitious and unlawful in some such sort of people as these Essetw were Coloss ii 8 as is the prayer to or towards the sun for his rising every morning mentioned before Â 5 very like those not much later obser vances made mention of in the preaching of Peter Authent Rcc Pt II page 669 and regarding a kindfof worship of angels of the month and of the moon and not celebrating the new moons or other festivals unless the moon appeared Which in deed seems to me the earliest mention of any regard to the moon s phasis in fixing the Jewish calendar of which the Talmud and later Rabbins talk so much and upon so very little ancient foundation Chap VIII WARS of f HE JEWS 8 But for those that are caught in any heinous sins they cast them out of their society and he who is thus separated from them does often die after a miserable manner for as he is bound by the oath he hath taken and by the customs he hath been engaged in he is not at liberty to partake of that food that he meets with elsewhere but is forced to eat grass and to fa mish his body with hunger till he perish for which reason they receive many of them again when they are at their last gasp out of compassion to them as thinking the miseries they have endured till they came to the very brink of death to be a suf ficient punishment for the sins they had been guilty of 9 But in the judgments they exercise they are most accurate and just nor do they pass sentence by the votes of acourt that is fewer than an hundred And as to what is once determined by that number it is unalterable What they most of all honour after God himself is the name of their legislator Moses whom if any one blaspheme he is punished capitally They also think it a good thing to obey their elders and the major part Ac cordingly if ten of them be sitting together no one of them will speak while the other nine are against it They also avoid spitting in the midst of them or on the right side Moreover they are stricter than any other of the Jews in restmg from their labours on the seventh day for they not only get their food ready the day before that they may not be obliged to kindle a fire on that day but they will not remove any vessel out of its place nor go to stool thereon Nay on other days they dig a small pit a foot deep with a paddle which kind of hatchet is given them when they are first admitted among them and covering themselves round with their garment that they may not affront the divine rays ef light they ease them selves into that pit after which they put the earth that was dug out again into the pit and even this they do only in the more lonely places which they choose out for this purpose and although this easement of the body be natural yet it is a rule with them to wash themselves after it as if it were a de filement to them 10 Now after the time of their preparatory trial is over they are parted into four classes and so far are the juniors in ferior to the seniors that if the seniors should be touched by the juniors they must wash themselves as if they had intermixed themselves with the company of a foreigner They are long lived also insomuch that many of them live above an hundred years by means of the simplicity of their diet nay as 1 think by means of the regular course of life they observe also They contemn the miseries of life ai d are above pain by thegenero Vot III 3 B sity 578 Book llr WARS OF THE JEWS sity of their mind And as for death if it will be for their gloryi they esteem it better than living always and indeed our war with the Romans gave abundant evidence what great souls they had in their trials wherein although they were tortured and distorted burnt and torn to pieces and went through all kinds of instruments of torment that they might be forced either to blaspheme their legislator or to eat what was forbid den them yet could they not be made to do either of them no nor once to flatter their tormentors or to shed a tear but they smiled in their very pains and laughed those to acorn who in flicted the torments upon them and resigned up their souls with great alacrity as expecting to receive them again II For their doctrine is this That bodies are corruptible and that the matter they are made of is not permanent but that the souls are immortal and continue for ever and that they come out of the most subtil air and are united to their bodies as to prisons into which they are drawn by a certain natural entice ment but that when they are set free from the bonds of the flesh they then as released from a long bondage rejoice and mount upward And this is like the opinion of the Greeks that good souls have their habitations beyond the ocean in a region that is neither oppressed with storms of rain or snow or with intense heat but that this place is such as is refreshed by the gentle breathing of a weit wind that is perpetually blowing from the ocean i while they allot to bad souls a dark and tempestuous den full of never ceasing punishments And indeed the Greeks seem to me to have followed the same notion when they allot the islands of the blessed to their brave men whom they call he roes and demigods and to the souls of the wicked the region of the ungodly in Hades where their fables relate that certain persons such as Sisyphus and Tantalus and Ixion and Tityus are punished which is built on this first supposition that souls are immortal and thence are those exhortations to virtue and dehortations from wickedness collected whereby good men are bettered in the conduct of their life by the hope they have of reward after their death and whereby the vehement inclination of bad men to vice are restrained by the fear and expectation they are in that although they should lie concealed in this life they should suffer immortal punishment after their death These are the divine doctrines of the Essens  about the soul which lay an unavoidable bait for such as have once had a taste of their philosophy IS There  Of these Jewish or Essene and indeed Christian doctrines concerning souls both good and bad in Hades see that excellent discourse or homily of our lots phus s concerning Hades at the end of vol IV Chap VIII WARS OF THE JEWS 3T0 12 There are also those among them who undertake to  foretel things to come by reading the holy books and using several sorts of purifications and being perpetually conversant in the discourses of the prophets  and it is but seldom that they miss in their predictions  13 Moreover there is another order of Essens who agree with the rest as to their way of living and customs and laws but differ from them in the point of marriage as thinking that by not marrying they cut off the principal part of human life which is the prospect of succession nay rather that if all men should be of the same opinion the whole race of mankind would fail However they try their spouses for three years and if they find that they have their natural purgations thrice as trials that they are likely to be fruitful they then actually marry them But they do not use to accompany with their wives when they are with child as a demonstration that they do not marry out of regard to pleasure but for the sake of poste rity Now the women go into the baths with some of their garments on as the men do with somewhat girded about them And these are the customs of this ordej of fesens 14 But then as to the two other orders at first mentioned the Pharisees are those who are esteemed most skilful in the exact explication of their laws and introduce the first sect These ascribe all to fate or providence and to God and yet allow that to act what is right or the contrary is principally in thÂ power of men although fete does co operate in every action They say that all souls are incorruptible but that the f souls of good men only are removedintootherbodies but thatthe souls of bad men are subject to eternal punishment But the Saddu cees  Dean Aldrich reckons up three example of this gift of prophecy in several of these Essens out of Josephns himself viz in the History of the War B I ch iii Â 5 vol HI Judas foretold the death of Antigonus at Strato s Tower B II chap vii Â 3 Simon foretold that Archdaus should reign but nine or cen years and Antiq B XV Â hap x Â 4 5 vol II Menehem foretold that Herod should be king and should reign tyrannically and that for more thap twenty or even thirty years AH which came to pass accordingly f There is so much more here about the Essens than ia cited from Josephus in Porphyry and Eusebius and yet so much lets about the Pharisees and Sadducees the two other Jewish sects than would naturally be expected in proportion to the Essens or third sect nay than teems to be referred to by himself elsewhere that one is tempted to suppose Josephus had at first written le E of the one and more of the two others than his present copies afford UB as also that by some unknown accident our present copies are here made up of the larger edition in the first case and of the smaller in the second See the note in Havercamp s edition Howe ver what Josephus says in the name of the Pharisees that only the souls of good men go out of one body into another although all souls be immortal and still the souls of the bad are liable to eternal punishment as also what he says afterwards Antiq B XVIII chap i Â 3 vol 111 that the soul s vigour is immortal and that tr d r the earth thsy receive rewards or punishments according as their lives huv 380 WARS OF THE JEWS Book II cees are those that compose the second order and take away fate entirel  and suppose that God is not concerned in our do ing or not doing what is evil and they say that to act what is good or what is evil is at men s own choice and that the one or the other belongs so to every one that they may act as they please They also take away the belief of the immortal dura tion of the soul and the punishments and rewards in Hades Moreover the Pharisees are friendly to one another and are for the exercise of concord and regard for the public but the be haviour of the Sadducees one towards another is in some degree wild and their conversation with those that are of their own party is as barbarous as if they were strangers to them And this is what 1 had to say concerning the philosophic sects among the Jews CHAP IX The death of Salome The cities which Herod and Philip built Pilate occasions disturbances Tiberius puts Agrippa into bonds but Cains frees him from them and makes him king Herod Antipas is banished Â 1 A ND now as the ethnarchy of Archelaus was fallen in JT to a Roman province the other sons of Herod Philip and that Herod who was called Antipas each of them took upon them the administration of their own tetrarchies for when Sa lome died she bequeathed to Julia the wife of Augustus both her toparchy and Jamnia as also her plantation of palm trees that were in Phasaelis  But when the Roman empire was translated to Tiberius the son of Julia upon the death of Au gustus who had reigned fifty seven years six months and two days been virtuous or vicious in the present world that to the bad is allotted an eternal prison but that the good are permitted to live again in this world are nearly agree ble to the doctrines of Christianity Only Josephus s rejection of the return of the wicked into other bodies or into this world which he grants to the good looks omewhat like a contradiction to St Paul s account of the doctrine of the Jews that  they themselves a lowed that there should be a resurrection of the dead both  of the just and ui just Acts ch xxiv 5 Yet because Josephus s account is that of the Pharisees and St Paui i that of t e Jews in general and of himself the Contradiction is not very certain  We have here in that Greek MS which was once Alexander Petavius s but is now in the lib ary at I erden two most remarkable additions to the common Copies though deemed worth little remark by the editor which upon the mention of Tiberius s coming to the empire inserts first the famous testimony of Josephus corcerning Jesus Christ as it stands verbatim in the Antiquities B XVIII chap iii Â 3 vol III with some parts of that excellent discourse or homily of Jojephus concerning Hades annexed to the work But what is here principally to be looted is this that in this homily Josephus having just mentioned Christ a  God tl e  Word and the Judge of the world appointed by the Father c adds That I he had himself elsewhere spoken about him more nicely or particularly Chap IX WARS OF THE JEWS 381 days both Herod and Philip continued in their tetrachies and the latter of them built the city Caesarea at the fountains of Jordan and in the region of Paneas as also the city Julias in the lower Gaulanitis Herod also built the city Tiberias in Galilee and in Perea beyond Jordan another that was also called Julias 2 Now Pilate who was sent as a procurator into Judea by Tiberius sent by night those images of Caesar that are called tnsigns into Jerusalem This excited a very great tumult among the jews when it was day for those that were near them were astonished at the sight of them as indications that their laws were trodden underfoot for those laws do not permit any sort of image to be brought into the city Nay besides the indigna tion which the citizens had themselves at this procedure a vast number of people came running out of the country These came zealously to Pilate to Cesarea and besought him to carry those ensigns out of Jerusalam and to preserve them their ancient laws inviolable  but upon Pilate s denial of their request they fell down prostrate upon the ground and continued immoveable in that posture for five days and as many nights 3 On the next day Pilate sat upon his tribunal in the open market place and called to him the multitude as desirous to give them an answer and then gave a signal to the soldiers that they should all by agreement at once encompass the Jews with their weapons so the band of soldiers stood round about the Jews in three ranks The Jews were under the utmost con sternation at that unexpected sight Pilate also said to them that they should be cut in pieces unless they would admit of Caesar s images and gave intimation to the soldiers to draw their naked swords Hereupon the Jews as it were at one signal fell down in vast numbers together and exposed their necks bare and cried out that they were sooner ready to be slain than that their law should be transgressed Hereupon Pi late was greatly surprised at their prodigious superstition and gave order that the ensigns should be presently carried out of Jerusalem 4 After this he raised another disturbance by expending that sacred treasure which is called  Corban upon aqueducts where by he brought water from the distance of four hundred fur longs At this the multitude had indignation  and when Pilate was come to Jerusalem they came about his tribunal and made a clamour at it Now when he was apprised aforehand of this disturbance  This use of the corban or oblation a here applied to the sacred money dedi eated to God in the treasury of the ternple illustrates our Saviour s words Mark V i II I   382 WARS OF THE JEWS Book II disturbance he mixed his own soldiers in their armour with the multitude and ordered them to conceal themselves under the habits of private men and not indeed to use their swords but with their staves to beat thnSe that made the clamour He then gave the signal from his tribunal to do as he had bidden them Now the Jews were so sadly beaten that many of them perished by the stripes they received and many of them perished as trodden to death by themselves by which means the multitude was astonished at the calamity of those that were slain and held their peace 5 In the mean time Agrippa the son of that Aristobulus who had been slain by his father Herod came to Tiberius to accuse Herod the tetrarch  who not admitting of his accusa tion he stayed at Rome and cultivated a friendship with others of the men of note but principally with Caius the son of Ger manicus who was then but a private person Now this Agrippa at a certain time feasted Caius and as he was very complai sant to him on several other accounts he at length stretched out his hands and openly wished that Tiberius might die and that he might quickly see him emperor of the world This was told to Tiberius by one of Agrippa s domestics who thereupon was very angry and ordered Agrippa to be bound and had hint very ill treated in the prison for six months until Tiberius died after he had reigned twenty two years six months and three days 6 But when Caius was made Caeiar he released Agrippa from his bonds and made him king of Philip s tetrachy who was now dead but when Agrippa had arrived at that degree of dignity he euflaincd the ambitious desires of Herod the tetrarch who was chiefly induced to hope for the royal authority by his wife Herodias who reproached him for his sloth and told him that it WHS only because he would not sail to Caesar that he was destitute of that great dignity forsince Caesar had made Agrippa a king from a private person much more would he advance him from a tetrarch to that dignity These arguments pre vailed with Herod so that he came to Caius by whom he was punishei for his ambition by being banished into Spain  for Agrippa followed him in order to accuse him to whom also Caius gave his tetrarchy by way of addition So Herod died in Spain whither his wife had followed him CHAP X Caius commands that his statue should le set up in the temple itself and what Petronius did thereupon â 1 T fO Caius Caesar did so grossly abuse the fortune he had arrived at as to take himself to be a god and to desire Chap X WARS or fHE JEWS 383 desire to be so called also and to cut off those of the greatest nobility out of his country He also extended his impiety as far as the Jews Accordingly he sent Petronius with an army to Jerusalem to place his  statues in the temple and com manded him that in case the Jews would not admit of them he should slay those that opposed it and carry all the rest of the nation into captivity but God concerned himself with these his commands However Petronius marched out of Antioch into Judea with three legions and many Syrian auxiliaries Now as to the Jews some of them could not believe the sto ries that spake of a war but those that did believe them were in the utmost distress how to defend themselves and the terror diffused itself presently through them all for the army was al ready come to Ptolemais 2 This Ptolemais is a maritime city of Galilee built in the great plain It is encompassed with mountains that on the east side sixty furlongs off belongs to Galilee but that on the south belongs to Carmel which is distant from it an hundred and twenty furlongs and that on the north is the highest of them all and is called by the people of the country the Ladder of the Tyriant which is at the distance of an hundred furlongs The very small river f Belus runs by it at the distance of two furlongs near which there isj Memnon smonument and hath near it a place no larger than an hundred cubits which deserves admiration for the place is round and hollow and affords such sand as glass is made of which place when it hath been emp tied by the many ships there loaded it is filled again by the winds which bring into it as it were on purpose that sand which lay remote and was no more than bare common sand while this mine presently turns it into glassy sand And what is to me still more wonderful that glassy sand which is super fluous and is once removed out of the place becomes bare com v mori sand again And this is the nature of the place we are speaking of 3 But now the Jews got together in great numbers with their wives and children into that plain that was by Ptolemaisj and made supplication to Petronius first for their laws and in the next place for themselves So he was prevailed upon by the  Tacitus owns that Caius commanded the Jews to place his effigies in their temple though he be mistaken when he adds that the Jews thereupon took arms t This account of a place near the mouth of the river Belus in Phenicia whence came that sand out of which the ancients made their glass is a known thing in history particularly in Tacitus and Strabo and more largely in Pliny  This Memnon had several monuments and one of them appears both by Strabo and Diodorui to have bÂ en in Syria and nut improbably in this very dace 38 WARS OF THE JEWS Book 1L the multitude of the supplicants and by their supplications and left his army ai d the statues at Ptolemais and then went forward into Galilee and called together the multitude and all the men of note to Tiberias and shewed them the power of the Romans and the threatenings of Caesar and besides this proved that their petition was unreasonable because while all the nations in subjection to them had placed the images of Cae sar in their several cities among the rest of their gods for them alone to oppose it was almost like the behaviour of re volters and was injurious to Ccesar 4 And when they insisted on their law and the custom of their country and how it was not only not permitted them to make either an image of God or indeed of a man and to put it in any despicable part of their country much less in the temple itself Petronius replied  And am not I also said he  bound to keep the law of my own lord For if I transgress  it and spare you it is but just that 1 perish while he that  sent me and not I will commence a war against you for I  am under command as well as you Hereupon the whole multitude cried out That  they are ready to suffer for their  law Petronius then quieted them and said to them  Will you then make war against Caesar The Jews said  We offer sacrifices twice every day for Caesar and for the Ro  man people but that if he would place the images among  them he must first sacrifice the whole Jewish nation and  that they were ready to expose themselves together with  their children arid wives to be slain At this Petronius was astonished and pitied them on account of the inexpressible sense of religion the men were under and that courage of theirs which made them ready to die for it so they were dismissed without success 5 But on the following flays he got together the men of power privately and the multitude publicly and sometimes he used persuasions to them and sometimes he tave them his ad vice but he chiefly made use ot threatening to them and insisted upon the power of the Romans and the anger of Caius and be sides upon the necessity he was himself unler to do as he was enjoined But as they could be no way prevailed upon and he saw that the country was iu danger of lying without tillage for it was about seed time that the multitude continued for fifty days together idle so he at last got them together and told them That  it was best for him to run some hazard himself  for either by the divine assistance I shall prevail with Caesar  and shall myself escape the danger as well as you which will â be matter of joy to us both or in case Caesar continue in hi Chap XL WARS OF THE JEWS â  385  rage I will be ready to expose my own life for such a great  number as you are Whereupon he dismissed the multitude who prayed greatly for his prosperity  and he took the army out of Ptolemais and returned to Antioch  from whence he presently sent an epistle to Caesar and informed him of the irruption he had made into Judea and of the supplications of the nation  and that unless he had a mind to lo e both the country and the men in it he must permit them to keep their law and must countermand his former injunction Cams answered that epistle in a violent way and threatened to have Petronius put to death for his being so tardy in the execution of what he had commanded But it happened that those who brought Caius s epistJe were tossed by a storm and were detained on the sea for three months while others that brought the news of Caius s death had a good voyage Accordingly Petronius received the epistle concerning Caius seventand twenty days before he received that which was against himself CHAP XI Concerning tie government of Claudius and the reign of Agrippa Concerning the deaths of Agrippa and of Hero J and what children they both left behind them Â 1 VTOW when Caius had reigned three years and eight L months and had been slain by treachery Claudius was hurried away by the armies that were at Rome to take the government upon htm but the senate upon the reference of the consuls Sentius Saturninus and Pomponius Secundus gave orders to the three regiments of soldiers that stayed with them to keep the city quiet and went up into the capitol in great num bers and resolved to oppose Claudius by force on account of the barbarous treatment they had met with from Caius  and they determined either to settle the nation under an aristocracy as they had of old been governed or at least to choose by vote such an one for emperor as might be worthy of it 2 Now it happened that at this time Agrippa sojourned at Rome and that both the senate called him to consult with them and at the same time Claudius sent for him out of the camp that he might be serviceable to him as he should have occa sion for his service So he perceiving that Claudius was in effect made Caesar already went to him who sent him as an ambassador to the senate to let them know what his intentions were  That  in the first place it was without his seeking  that he was hurried away by the soldiers moreover that he  thought it was not just to desert those soldiers in such their VOL III 3 C  zeal 386 WARS OF THE JEWS Book II  zeal for him and that if he should do so his own fortune  would be in uncertainty for that it was a dangerous case to  have been once called to the empire He added farther that  he would administer the government as a good prince and  not like a tyrant  for that he would be satisfied with the ho  nour of being called emperor but would in every one of his  actions permit theni all to give him their advice  for that  although he had not been by nature for moderation yet would  the death of Caius afford him a sufficient demonstration how  soberly he ought to act in that station 3 This message was delivered by Agrippa to which the senate replied That  since they had arf army and the wisest Â consuls on their sitle they would not endure a voluntary sk  very And when Claudius heard what answer the senate had  made he sent Agrippa to them again with the following mes sage That  he could not bear the thoughts of betraying them  that had given their oaths to be true to him  and that  he saw he must fight though unwillingly against such as he  had no mind to fight that however if it must come to that  it was proper to choose a place without the city for the war   because it wai not agreeable to piety to pollute the temples  of their own city with the blood of their own countrymen  and this only on occasion of their imprudent conduct And when Agrjppa had heard this message he delivered it to the senators 4 In the mean time One of the soldiers belonging to the se nate drew his sword and cried out  O my fellow soldiers  what is the meaning of this choice of ours to kill our brethren  and to use violence to our kindred that are with Claudius  kl while we may have him for our emperor whom no one can  blame and who hath so many just reasons to lay claim to the  government  and this with regard to those against whom Â we are going to fight When he had said this he marched through the whole senate and carried all the soldiers along with him Upon which all the patricians were immediately at a great fright nt their being thus deserted But still because there appeared no other way whither they could turn themselves for deliverance they made haste the same way with the soldiers and went to Claudius But those that had the greatest luck in flattering the good fortune of Claudius betimes met them be fore the walls with their naked swords and there was reasonto fear that those that came first might have been in danger before Claudius could know what violence the soldiers were going to offer them had not Agrippa ran before and told him what a dangerous thing they were going about and that unless he re strained Chap XI WARS OF THE JEWS 381 strained the violence of these men who were in a fit of madness against the patricians he would lose those on whose account it was most desireable to rule and would be emperor over a desert 5 When Claudius heard this he restrained the violence of the soldiery and received the senate into the camp and treated them after an obliging manner and went out with them present ly to offer their thank offerings to God which were proper up on his first coming to the empire Moreover he bestowed on Agrippa his whole paternal kingdom immediately and added to it besides those countries that had been given by Augustus to Herod Trachoniti s and Auranitis and still besides these that kingdom which was called the kingdom of Lysaniat This gift he declared tothe people by a decree but ordered the magistrates to have the donation engraved on tables of brass and to be set ap in the capitol He bestowed on his brother Herod who was also his son in law by marrying his daughter Bernice the kingdom of Chalcis 6 So now riches flowed in to Agrippa by his enjoyment of so large a dominion nor did he abuse the money he had on small matters but he began to encompass Jerusalem with such a wall which had it been brought to perfection had made it im practicable for the Romans to take it by siege but his death which happened at Cesarca before he had raised the walls to their due height prevented him He had then reigned three years as he had governed his tetrarchies three other years He left behind him three daughters born to him by Cyprus Ber nice Mariamne and Brasilia and a son born of the same mo ther whose name was Agrippa he was left a very young child so that Claudius made the country a Roman province and sent Cuspius Fadus to be its procurator and after him Tiberias Alexander who making no alterations of the ancient laws kept the nation in tranquillity Now after this Herod the king of Chalcis died and left behind him two sons born to him of his brother s daughter Bernice their names were Bernicianus and Hyreanm Â He also left behind him Aristobulus whom he had by his former wife Mariamne There was besides ano ther brother of his that died a private person his name was al so Aristobulus who left behind him a daughter whose name was Jotape and these as I have formerly said were the chil dren of Aristobulus the son of Herod which Aristobulus and Alexander were born to Herod by Mariamne and were slain by him But as for Alexander s posterity they reigned in Armenia 3 C 3 CHAP 388 WARS OF THE

king of Chalcls Claudius set Agrippa the son of Agrippa over his uncle s king dom while Cumanus took upon him the office of procurator of the rest which was a Roman province and therein he succeeded Alexander under which Cumanus began the troubles and the Jews ruin came on fur when the multitude were come together to Jerusalem to the feast of unleavened bread and a Roman co hort stood over the cloisters of the temple for they always were armed and kept guard at the festivals to prevent any innovation which the multitude thus gathered together might make one of the soldiers pulled back his garment and couring down after an indecent manner and turned his breech tothe Jews and spake such words as you may expect upon such a posture At thia the whole multitude had indignation and made a clamour to Cumanus that he would punish the soldier while the rasher part of the youth and such as were naturally the most tumultu ous fell to fighting and caught up stones and threw them at the soldiers Upon which Cumanus was afraid lest all the people should make an assault upon him and sent to call for more arm ed men who when they came in great numbers into the clois ters the Jews were in a very great consternation and being beaten out of the temple they ran into the city and the vio lence with which they crowded to get out was so great that they trode upon each other and squeezed one another till ten thousand of them were killed insomuch that this feast became the cause of mourning to the whole nation and every family lamented their own relations 2 Now there followed after this another calamity which a rose from a tumult made by robbers for at the public road of Beth lioron one Stephen a servant of Caesar carried some furni ture which the robbers fell upon and seized upon this Cuma nus sent men to go round about to the neighbouring villages and to bringtheir inhabitants to him bound aslaying it totheircharge that they had not pursued after the thieves and caught them Now here it was that a certain soldier finding the sacred book of the law tore it to pieces and  threw it into the fire Here upon the Jews were in great disorder as if their whole country were  Reland notes here that the Talmud in recounting ten sad accidents for which the Jews ought to rend their garments reckons this for or e  When they htfcr  that t ie law of God is bjirn Chap XII WARS OF THÂ JEWS SS9 were in a flame and assembled themselves so many of them by their zeal for their religion as by an engine and ran together with united clamour to Cesarea to Cumanus and made suppll cation to him that he would not overlook this man who had offered such an affront to God and to his law but punish him for what he had done Accordingly he perceiving that the mul titude would not be quiet unless they had a comfortable answer from him gave order that the soldier should be brought and drawn through those that required to have him punished to ex ecution which being done the Jews went their ways 3 After this there happened a fight between the Galileans and the Samaritans it happenedatavillage called Geman which is si tuate in the great plain of Samaria where as a great number of Jews were going up to Jerusalem to the feast of tabernacles a certain Galilean was slain and besides a vast number of people ran together out of Galilee in order to fight with the Samaritans j but the principal men among them came to Cumanus and be sought him that before the evil became incurable he would come into Galilee and bring the authorsof thismurdertopunish ment for that there was no other way to make the multitude se parate without coming to blows However Cumanus postpon ed their supplications to the other affairs he Mas then about and sent the petitioners away without success 4 But when the affair of this murder came to be told at Je rusalem it put the multitude into disorder and they left the feast and without any generals to conduct them they marched with great violence to Samaria nor would they be ruled by any of the magistrates that were set over them but they were mana ged by one Eleazar the son of Dineus and by Alexander in these their thievish and seditious attempts These men fell up on those that were in the neighbourhood of the Acrabatene top archy and slew them without sparing any age and set the vil lages on fire 5 But Cumanus took one troop of horsemen called the troop of Sebaste out of Cesarea and came to the assistance of those that were spoiled he also seized upon a great number of those that followed Eleazar and slew more of them And as for the rest of the multitude of those that went so zealously to fight with the Samaritans the rulers of Jerusalem ran out clothed with sackcloth and having ashes on their head and begged of them to go their ways lest by their attempt to revenge themselves upon the Samaritans they should provoke the Romans to come against Jerusalem to have compassion upon their country and temple their children and their wives and not bring the utmost dangers of destruction upon them in order to avenge themselves upon S99 WARS OF THE JEWS Book II upon one Galilean only The Jews complied with these persua sions of theirs and dispersed themselves but still there were a great number who betook themselves to robbing in hopes of impunity and rapines and insurrections of the bolder sort hap pened over the whole country and the men of power among the Samaritans came to Tyre to  Ummidius Quadratus the president of Syria und desired that they that had laid waste the country might be punished the great men also of the Jews and Jonathan the son of Ananlis the high priest came thither and said that the Samaritans were the beginners of the disturbance oa account of that murder they had committed and that Cuma nus had given occasion to what had happened by his unwilling ness to punish the original authors of that murder 6 But Quadratus put both parties off for that time and told them that when he should come to those places he would make a diligent inquiry after every circumstance After which he went to Cesare and crucified all those whom Cumanus had taken alive and when from thence he was COITC to the city Lydda he heard the affair of the Samaritans and sent for eigh teen of the Jews whom he had learned to have been concerned in that fight and beheaded them but he sent two others of those that were of the greatest power among them and both Jo nathan and Ananias the high priests as also Ananus the son of this Ananias and certain others that were eminent among the Jews to Caesar as he did in like manner by the most illustrious of the Samaritans He also ordered that Cumanus the procu rator and Celer the tribune should sail to Rome in order to give an account of what had been done to Caesar When he had fi nished these matters he went up from Lydda to Jerusalem and finding the multitude celebrating their feast of unleavened bread without any tumult he returned to Antioch 7 Now when Caesar at Rome had heard what Cumanus and the Samaritans had to say where it was done in the hearing of Agrippa who zealously espoused the cause of the Jews as in like manner many of the great men stood by Cumanus he condemned the Samaritans and commanded that three of the most powerful men among them should be put to death he ba nished Cumanus and sent Celer bound to Jerusalem to be de livered over to the Jews to be tormented that he should be drawn round the city and then beheaded 6 After this Caesar sent Felixf the brother of Pallas to be procurator  This Ummidius or Numidiiw or as Tacitus calls him VhiJixs QuaJratiu is mentioned in an ancient inscription still preserved as Spanheim here inform us Â hich calls him UMMIDIUS QUADRATUS t Take the character of this Felix who is well known from the Acts of the Chap XlII WARS OF THE JEWS 39 procurator of Galilee and Samaria and Perea and removed A grippa from Chalcis unto a greater kingdom for he gave him the tetrarchy which had belonged to Philip which contained Ba tanea Trachonitis and Gaulanitis he added to it the kingdom of Lysanias and that province Abilene which Varus had go verned But Claudius himself when he had administered the government thirteen years eight months and twenty days died and left Nero to be his successor in the empire whom he had adopted by his wife Agrippina s delusions in order to be his successor although he had a son of his own whose name was Britannicus by Messalina his former wife and a daughter whose name was Octavio whom he had married to Nero he had also another daughter by

Antiq B XX ch vii Â i Vol III in the word of Tacitus produced here by Dean Aldrich  Felix exercised says Tacitus the authority of a king with the 11 disposition of a slave and relying upon the great power of his brother Pallas at  court thought he might safely be guilty pf all kinds of wicked practices Ob serve also the time when he was made procurator A D 52 that when St Paul pleaded his cause before him A D 58 he might have been  many years a judge  unto that nation as St Paul says he had then been Acts Jtxiv 10 But as to what Tacitus here lays that before the death of Cumanus Felix was procurator over Samaria only does not well agree with St Paul s words who would hardly have called Samaria a Jeiuitt nation In short since what Tacitus here says if a bout countries very remote from Rome where he lived since what he says of two Roman procurators the one over Galilee the other over Samaria at the same Â ime is without all example else where and since Josephus who lived at that very lime in Judea appears to have known nothing of this procuratorship of Felix be fore the death of Cumamis T much suspect the story itself as nothing better than a mistake of Tacitus especially when it seems not only omitted but contradicted by Josephs as any one may find that compares their histoiies together Possi bly Felix might have been a subordinate judge among the Jews sometime before

of his time in which the Jews were concerned 2 Nero therefore bestowed the kingdom of the lesser Ar menia upon Aristobulus  Herod s son and he added lo Agrip pa s kingdom four cities with the toparchies to them belong ing I mean Abila and that Julias which is in Perea Tarichea also and Tiberias of Galilee but over the rest of Judea he made Felix procurator This Felix took Eleazar the arch rob ber and many that were with him alive when thev had rava ged the country for twenty years together and sent them to Rome but as to the number of the robbers he caused to be crucified and of those who were caught among them and whom he brought to punishment they were a multitude not to be enumerated 3 When the country was purged of these there sprang up another sort of robbers in Jerufalem which were called Sicarii who slew men in the day time and in the midst of the city this they did chiefly at the festivals when they mingled them selves among the multitude and concealed daggers under their garments with which they stabbed those that were their ene mies  and when any fell down dead the murderers became a part of those that had indignation against them by which means they appeared persons of such reputation that they could by no means be discovered The first man who was slain by them was Jonathan the high priest after whose death many were slain e very day while the fear men were in of being so served was more afflicting than the calamity itself and while c very body expected death every hour as men do in war so men were o bliged to look before them and to take notice of their enemies at a great distance nor if their friends were coming to them durst they trust them any longer but in the midst of their suspicions and guarding of themselves they were slain Such was the celerity of the plotters against them and so cunning was their contrivance 9 There was also another body of wicked men gotten toge ther not so impure in their actions but more wicked in their intentions which laid waste the happy state of the city no less than did these murderers These were such men ss deceived and deluded the people under pretence of divine inspiration but were for procuring innovations and changes of the government and these  i e Herod king ef Chalet Chap XIII WARS OF THE JEWS 393 these prevailed with the multitude to act like madmen and went before them into the wilderness as pretending that God would there shew them the signals of liberty But Felix thought this procedure was to be the beginning of a revolt so he sent some horsemen and footmen both armed who destroy ed a great number of them  5 But there was an Egyptian false prophet that did the Jews more mischief than the former for he was a cheat and pre tended to be a prophet also and got together thirty thousand men that were deluded by him these he led round about from the wilderness to the mount which was called the Mount of O lives and was ready to break into Jerusalem by force from that place and if he could but once conquer the Roman garrison and the people he intended to domineer over them by the assis tance of those guards of his that were to break into the city with him But Felix prevented his attempt and met him with his Roman soldiers while all the people assisted him in his at tack upon them insomuch that when it came to a battle the Egyptian ran away with a few others while the greatest part of those that were with him were either destroyed or taken alive but the rest of the multitude were dispersed every one to their own homes and there concealed themselves 6 Now when these were quieted it happened as it does in a diseased body that another part was subject to an inflammation for a company of deceivers and robbers got together and per suaded the Jews to revolt and exhorted them to assert their li berty inflicting death on those that continued in obedience to the Roman government and saying that such as willingly chose slavery ought lo be forced from such their desired inclinations for they parted themselves into different bodies and lay in wait up and down the country and plundered the houses of the great men and slew the men themselves and set the villages on fire a id this till all Judea was filled with the effects of their mad ness And thus the flame was every day more and more blown up till it came to a direct war 7 There was also another disturbance at Cesarea those Jews who were mixed with the Syrians that lived there raising a tumult against them The Jews pretended that the city was theirs and said that he who built it was a Jew meaning king Herod The Syrians confessed also that its builder was a Jew but they still said however that the city was a Grecian city for that he who set up statues and temples in it could not design it for Jews On which account both parties had a contest with one another and this contest increased so much that it came at last to arms and the bolder sort of them marched out to fight VOL Ill 3 D for WARS OF TOE JEWS Book tf for the elders of the Jews were not able to put a stop to their own people that were disposed to be tumultuous and the Greeks thought it a shame for them to be overcome by the Jews Now these Jews exceeded the others in riches and strength of body but the Grecian part had the advantage of assistance from the soldiery  for the greatest part of the Roman garrison was raised out of Syria and being thus related to the Syrian part they were ready to assist it However the governors of the city were concerned to keep all quiet and whenever they caught those that were most for fighting on either side they punished them with stripes and bands Yet did not the sufferings of those that were caught affright the remainder or make them desist but they were still move and more exasperated and deep engaged in the sedition And as Felix came once into the mar ket place and commanded the Jews when they had beaten the Syrians to go their ways and threatened them if they would not and they would not obey him he sent his soldiers out upon them and slew a great many of them upon which it fell out that what they had was plundered And as the sedition still continued he chose out the most eminent men on both sides as ambassadors to Nero to argue about their several privileges CHAP XIV Festus succeeds Ftlix wlo is succeeded by Albinus as he is by Floras who by the barbarity of his government forces tie into the war Â 1  VTO W it was that Festus succeeded Felix as procurator JLN and made it his business to correct those that made dis turbances in the country So he caught the greatest part of the robbers and destroyed a great many of them But then Albinus who succeeded Festus did not execute his office as the other had done nor was there any sort of wickedness that could be named but he had an hand in it Accordingly he did not on ly in his political capacity steal and plunder every one s sub stance nor did he only burden the whole nation with taxes but he permitted the relations of such as were in prison for robbery and had been laid there either by the senate of every city or by the former procurators to redeem them for money and no bo dy remained in the prisons as a malefactor but he who gave him nothing At this time it was that the enterprises of the seditious at Jerusalem were very formidable  the principal men among them purchasing leave of Albinus to go on with their seditious practices while that part of the people who delighted in disturbances joined themselves to such as had fellowship with Albinus  XIV WAHS OF THE JEWS â 395 Albums  and every one of those wicked wretches was encom passed with his own band of robbers while he himself like an arch robber or a tyrant made a figure among his company and abused his authority over those about him in order to plunder those that lived quietly The effect of which was this that those who lost their goods were forced to hold their peace when they had reason to shew great indignation at what they had suf fered  but those who had escaped were forced to flatter him that deserved to be punished out of the fear they were in of suffering equally with the others Upon the whole no body durst speak their minds but tyranny was generally tolerated  and at this time were those seeds sown which brought the city to destruction 2 And though such was the character of Albinus yet did Gessius  Florus who succeeded him demonstrate him to have 1Â een a most excellent person upon the comparison  for the for mer did the greatest part of his rogueries in private and with a sort of dissimulation  but Gessius did his unjust actions to the harm of the nation after a pompous manner  and as though he had been sent as an executioner to punish condemned male factors he emitted no sort of rapine or of vexation  where the case was really pitiable he was most barbarous and in things of the greatest turpitude he was most impudent Nor could any one outdo him in disguising the truth nor could any one con trive more subtle ways of deceit than he did He indeed thought it but a petty offence to get money out of single persons  so he spoiled whole cities and ruined entire bodies of men at once snd did almost publicly proclaim it all the country over that they had liberty givÂ n them to turn robbers upon this condi tion that he might go shares with them in the spoils they got Accordingly this his greediness of gain was the occasion that entire toparchies were brought to desolation and a great many of the people left their own country and fled into foreign pro vinces 3 And truly while Cestius Oallus was president of the pro vince of Syria nobody durst do so much as send an embassage to him against Florus  but when he was come to Jerusalem up on the approach of the feast of unleavened bread the people came  Net long after this beginning of Floras the wickedest of all the Roman pro curators of Judea and the immediate occasion of the Jewish war at the nth year of Nero and the i th of Agrippa or A D 66 the history in the XX books of Josephus Antiquities ends  although Josephus did not finish the e books tiil the 1 1th of Domitian or A D 93 twenty seven years afterward as he did not finish their Appendix containing an account of his own life till Agrippa was dead which happened in the 3d year of Trajan or A D 100 as 1 have several timeÂ otserved before 3 D2 WARS OF THE JEWS Book II came about him not fewer in number than three millions these besought him to commiserate the calamities of their na tion and cried out upon Floras as the bune of their country But as he was present and stood by Cestius he laughed at theu words However Cestius when he had quieted the multitude and had assured them thut he would take care that Florus should hereafter treat them in a more gentle manner returned to An tioch  Fiorus also conducted him as far as Cesarea and delud ed him though he had at that very time the purpose of shewing his anger at the nation and procuring a war upon them by which means alone it was that he supposed he might conceal his enormities for heexpectedthat if the peace continued he should have the Jews for his accusers before Caesar  but that if he could procure them to make a revolt he should divert their laying lesser crimes to his charge by a misery that was so much greater  he therefore did every day augment their calamities in order to induce them to a rebellion 4 Now at this time it happened that the Grecians at Cesa rea had been too hard for the Jews and had obtained of Nero the government of the city and had brought the Judicial deter mination  at the same time began the war in the twelfth year of the reign of Nero and the seventeenth of the reign of Agrip pa in the month of Artemisius Jyar Now the occasion of this war was by no means proportionable to those heavy calamities which it brought upon us For the Jews that dwelt at Cesarea had a synagogue near the place whose owner was a certain Ce sareau Greek  the Jews had endeavoured frequently to have purchased the possession of the place and had offered many times its value for its price but as the owner overlooked their of fers so did he raise other buildings upon the place in way of affront to them and made working shops of them and left them but a narrow passage and such as was very troublesome for them to go along to their synagogue Whereupon the warm er part of the Jewish youth went hastily to the workmen and forbade them to build there  but as Florus would not permit them to use force the great men of the Jews with John the pub lican being in the utmost distress what to do persuaded Floi us with the ofter of eight t aler ts to hinder the work He then being intent upon nothing but getting money promised he would do for them all they desired of him and then went away from Cesarea to Sebaste and left the sedition to take its full course as if he hi d sold a licence to the Jews to fight it out 5 Now  Heie we may note that 3 000 000 of the Jews were present at the passover A D 65 which confirms what Josephus elsewhere informs us of that at a passover a little later they counted 256 500 paschal lambs which at twelve to er ch lamb which is no immoderate calculation come to 3 078 030 See B VI chup 9 Â 3 Chap XIV WARS OF THE JEWS 307 5 Now on the next day which was the seventh day of the week when the Jews were crowding apace to their synagogue a certain man of Cesarea of a seditious temper got an earthen vessel and set it with the bottom upward at the entrance of that synagogue and sacrificed birds  This thing provoked the Jews to an incurable degree because their laws were affronted and the place was polluted Whereupon the sober and moder ate part of the Jews thought it proper to have recourse to their governors again while the seditious part and such as were in the fervour of their youth were vehemently inflamed to fight The seditious also among the Gentiles of Cesarea stood ready for the same purpose for they had by agreement sent the man to sacrifice beforehand as ready to support him so that it soon came to blows Hereupon Jucundus the master of the horse who was ordered to prevent the fight came thither and took away the earthen vessel and endeavoured to put a stop to the sedition but when he was overcome by the violence of the people of Cesarea the Jews caught up their books of the law and retired to Narbata which was a place to them belonging distant from Cesarea sixty furlongs But John and twelve of the principal men with him went toFIorus to Sebaste and made a lamentable complaint of their case and besought him to help them and with all possible decency put him in mind of the eight talents they had given him but he had the men seized upon and put in prison and accused them for carrying the books of the law out of Cesarea 6 Moreover as to the citizens of Jerusalem although they took this matter very ill yet did theyrestraintheirpassionj but Florus acted herein as it he had been lured and blew up the war into a flame and sent sometotake seventeen talentsoutof the sacred trea sure and pretended that Caesar wanted them A t this the peeple were in confusion immediately and ran together to the temple with prodigious clamours and called upon Caesar by name and besought him to free them from the tyranny of Florus Some also of the seditious cried out upon F lorus and cast the great est reproaches upon him and carried a basket about and begged some spills of money for him as for one that was destitute of possessions and in a miserable condition Yet was not he made ashamed hereby of his love of money but was more enraged and provoked to get still more and instead of coming to Ce sarea  Take hen Dr Hudson s very pertinent note  By this action sayi he the  killing of a bird over an earthen vessel the Jews were exposed as a leprous peor  pie for that was to be done by the law in the cleansing of a leper Levit ch  xiv It is a â o known that the Gentiles reproached the Jews as nibject to the  leprosy and belfeted that they were driven out of Egypt on that account ThiÂ  that eminent person Mt Reland suggested to me WARS OF THE JEWS Book II sarea as he ought to have done and quenching the flame of war which was beginning thence and so taking away the occasion of any disturbances on which account it was that he had received a reward of eight talents he marched hastily with an army of horsemen and footmen against Jerusalem that he might gain his will by the arms of the Romans and might hy his terror and by his threatenings bring the city into subjection 7 But the people were desirous of making Florus ashamed of his attempt and met his soldiers with acclamations and put themselves in order to receive him very submissively But he sent Capito a centurion before hand with fifty soldiers to bid them go back and not now make a shew of receiving him in an o bliging manner whom they had so fondly reproached before and said that it was incumbent on them in case they had ge nerous souls and were free speakers to jest upon him to his face and appear to be lovers of liberty not only in words but with their weapons also With this message was the multitude amazed and upon the coming of Capito s horsemen into the midst of them they were dispersed before they could salute Flo rus or manifest their submissive behaviour to him Accord ingly they retired to their own houses and spent that night in fear and confusion of face 8 Now at this time Florus took up his quarters at the pa lace and on the next day he had his tribunal set before it and sat upon it when the high priests and the men of power and those of the greatest eminence in the city came all before that tribunal upon which Florus commanded them to deliver up to him those that had reproached him and told them that they should themselves partake of the vengeance to them belonging if they did not produce the criminals but these demonstrated that the people were peaceably disposed and they begged for giveness for those that had spoken amiss for that it was no wonder at all that in so great a multitude there should be some more daring than they ought to be and by reason of their young er age foolish also and that it was impossible to distinguish those that offended from the rest while every one was sorry for what he had done and denied it out of fear of what would follow that he ought however to provide for the peace of the nation and to take such counsels as might preserve the city for the Romans and rather for the sake of a great number of innocent people to forgive a few that were guilty than for the sake of a few of the wicked to put so large and good a body of men in to disorder 9 Florus was more provoked at this and called out aloud to the soldiers to plunder that which was called Tie Upper Mar ket Chap XV WARS or THE JEWS ket Place and to slay such as they met with So the soldiers taking this exhortation of their commander in a sense agreeable to their desire of gain did not only plunder the place they were sent to but forcing themselves into every house they slew its inhabitants so the citizens Red along the narrow lanes and the soldiers slew those that they caught and no method of plunder was omitted they also caught many of the quiet people and brought them beforeFlorus whom he first chastised with stripes and then crucified Accordingly the whole number of those that were destroyed that day with their wives and children for they did not spare even the infants themselves was about three thousand and six hundred And what made this calami ty the heavier was this new method of Roman barbarity for Florus ventured then to do what no one had done before that is to have men of the  equestrian order whipped and nailed to the cross before his tribunal who although they were by birth Jews yet were they of Roman dignity notwithstanding CHAP XV Concerning Bernice j petition to Florus to spare the Jews lut in vain  as also how after the seditious flame was quenched it was kindled again by Florus J â A BOUT this very time king Agrippa was going to Alex J andria to congratulate Alexander upon his having obtained the government of Egypt from Nero but as his sister Bernice was come to Jerusalem and saw the wicked practices of the soldiers she was sorely affected at it and frequently sent the masters of her horse and her guards to Florus and begged of him to leave off these slaughters but he would not comply with her request nor have any regard either to the multitude of those already slain or to the nobility of her that interceded but only to the advantage he should make by this plundering nay this violence of the soldiers brake out to such a degree of madness that it spent itself on the queen herself for they did not only torment and destroy those whom they had caught un der her very eyes but indeed had killed herself also unless she had prevented them by flying to the palace and had stayed there all night with her guards which she had about her for fear of an insult from the soldiers Now she dwelt then at Jerusalem in  Here we have examples of native Jews who were Â f the equestrian order a mong the Romans and so ought never to have been whipped or crucified ac cording to the Roman laws See almost the like case in St Paul himielf Acts liii tf â i 400 WARS OF THE JEWS Book II in order to perform a  vow which she had made to God for it is usual with those that had been either afflicted with a dis temper or with any other distresses to make vows  and for thirty days before they are to offer their sacrifices to abstain from wine and to shave tire hair of their head Which things Bernice was now performing and stood barefoot before Florus s tribunal and besought him to spare the Jews Yet could she neither have any reverence paid to her nor could she escape without some danger of being slain herself 2 This happened upon the sixteenth day of the month Arte misius Jyar Now on the next day the multitude who were hi a great agony ran together to the upper market place and made the loudest lamentations for those that had perished and the greatest part of the cries were such as reflected on Florus at which the men of power were affrighted together with the high priests and rent their garments and fell down before each of them and besought them to leave off and not to provoke Florus to some incurable procedure besides what they had al ready suffered Accordingly the multitude complied imme diately out of reverence to those that had desired it of them and out of the hope they had that Florus would do them no more injuries 3 So Florus was troubled that the disturbances were over and endeavoured to kindle that flame again find sent for the high priests with the other eminent persons and said The only de monstration that the people would not make any other innova tions should be this that they must go out and meet the soldiers that  This vow which Bernice here and elsewhere called Queen not only as daugh ter and sister to two kings Agrippa the Great and Agrippa junior but the wi dow of Herod king of Chalci came now to accomplish at Jerusalem was not that of a Nazarite but such an one as religious Jews used to make in hopes of any deliverance from a disease or other danger as Josephus here intimates However these thirty days abode at Jerusalem for fasting and preparation against the obla tion of a proper saoifice seems to be too long uij Â ss it were wholly voluntary in this great lady It is not required in the law of Moses relating to Nazarites Numb vi and is very different from St Paul s time for tuch preparation which was but one day Acts xxi 26 So we want already the continuation of the Antiquities to afford us light here as they have hitherto done on so many occasions elsewhere Perhaps in this age the traditions of the Pharisees had obliged the Jews to this de gree of rigour not only as to these thirty days preparation but as to the going barefoot all that time which here Bernice submitted to also For we know that ei God s and our Siviour s yoke is usually easy and his burden comparatively light in such positive injunctions Mat xi 30 so did the Scribes and Pharisees some times  bind upon men heavy burdens and grievous to be born even when  they themselves would not touch them with one of their fingers Mat xxiii 4 Luke xi 46 However Noldius well observes Be Herod No 404 414 that Juvenal in his sixth satire alludes to this remarkable ptnance of submission of this Bernice to Jewish discipline and jests upon her for it as do Tacitus Dio Sueto nius and Sextus Aurelius mention her as one well known at Rome it j Chap XV WARS OF THE JEWS 401 that were ascending from Cesarea whence two cohorts were coming and while these men were exhorting the multitude so to do he sent before hand and gave directions to the centurions of the cohorts that they should give notice to those that were under them not to return the Jews salutations and that if they made any reply to his disadvantage they should make use of their weapons Now the high priests assembled the multitude in the temple and desired them to go and meet the Romans and to salute the cohorts very civilly before their miserable case should become incurable Now the seditious part would not comply with these persuasions but the consideration of those that had been destroyed made them incline to those that were the boldest for action 4 At this time it was that every priest and every servant of God brought out the holy vessels and the ornamental garments wherein they used to minister in sacred things The harpers also and the singers of hymns came out with their instruments of music and fell down before the multitude and begged of them that they would preserve those holy ornaments to them and not provoke the Romans to carry off those sacred treasures You might also see then the high priests themselves with dust sprinkled in great plenty upon their heads with bosoms depri ved of any covering but what was rent these besought every one of the eminent men by name and the multitude in com mon that they would not for a small offence betray their coun try to those that were desirous to have it laid waste  saying  What benefit will it bring to the soldiers to have a saluta  tion from the Jews or what amendmenlfof your affairs will  it bring you if you do not now go out to meet them  and  that if they saluted them civilly all handle would be cut off  from Florus to begin a war that they should thereby gain  their country and freedom from all farther sufferings  and  that besides it would be a sign of great want of command of  themselves if they should yield to a few seditious persons  while it was fitter for them who were so great a people to  force the others to act soberly 5 By these persuasions which they used to the multitude and to the seditious they restrained some by threatenings and others by the reverence that was paid them After this they led them out and they met the soldiers quietly and after a composed manner and when they were come up with them they saluted them but when they made no answer the se ditious exclaimed against Florus which was the signal given for falling upon them The soldiers therefore encompassed them presently and struck them With their clubs and as VOL III 3 E  the 402 WARS OF THE JEWS Book II they fled away the horsemen trampled them down so that a great many fell down dead by the strokes of the Romans and more by their own violence in crushing one another Now there was a terrible crowding about the gates and while every body was making haste to get before another the flight of them all was retarded and a terrible destruction there was among those that fell down for they were suffocated and broken to pieces by the multitude of those that were uppermost nor could any of them be distinguished by his relations in order to the care of his funeral the soldiers also who beat them fell upon those whom they overtook without shewing them any mercy and thrust the multitude through the place called Bezetha as they forced their way in order to get in and seize upoa the temple and the tower Antonia Florus also being desirous to get those places into his possession brought such as were with liim out of the king s palace and would have compelled them to get as far as the citadel Antonia but his attempt failed for the people immediately turned back upon him and stopped the violence of his attempt and as they stood upon the tops of their houses they threw their darts at the Romans who as they were sorely galled thereby because those weapons came from above and they were not ablÂ to make a passage through the multitude which stopped up the narrow passages they retired to the camp which was at the palace 6 But for the seditious they were afraid lest Florus should come again and get possession of the temple through Antonia so they got immediately upon those cloisters of the temple that joined to Antonia and cut them down This cooled the ava rice of Florus for whereas he was eager to obtain the treasures of God in the temple and on that account was desirous of get ting into Antonia as soon as the cloisters were broken down he left off his attempt he then sent for the high priests and the Sanhedrim and told them that he was indeed himself going out of the city but that he would leave them as large a garrison as they should desire Hereupon they promised that they would make no innovations in case he would leave them one band but  I take this Bezetha to be that small hill adjoining to the north side of the temple whereon was the hospital with live porticoes or cloisters and beneath which was the sheep pool of Bethesda into which an angel or messenger at a certain season descended and where he or they who were the  first put into  the pool were cured John v I c This situation of Bezetha in Josephus on the north side of the temple and not far off the tower Antonia exactly agrees to the place of the same pool at this day Only the remaining cloisters are but three See Maundrel page 106 The entire buildings seem to have been called the Ntia City and this part where was the hospital peculiarly Bezetha or Beth See chap six Â 4 Chap XVf WARS or THE JEWS 403 but not that which had fought with the Jews because the mul titude bare ill will against that band on account of what they had suffered from it so he changed the band as they desired and with the rest of his forces returned to Cesarea CHAP XVI Cettias sends Neopolitanus the tribune to see in what condition the affairs ofthejewt were Agrippa makes a speech to the peo ple of the Jews that he may divert them from their intentions of making war with the Romans Â l TTO WE VER Floras contrived another way to oblige A JL the Jews to begin the war and sent to Cestius and accused the Jews falsely of revolting from the Roman govern ment and imputed the beginning of the former fight to them and pretended they had been the authors of that disturbance wherein they were only the sufferers Yet were not the go vernors ef Jerusalem silent upon this occcasion but did themselves write to Gestius as did Bernice also about the illegal practices of which Floras had been guilty against the city  who upon reading both accounts consulted with his captains what he should do Now some of them thought it best for Cestius to go up with his army either to punish the revolt if it was real or to settle the Roman affairs on a surer foundation if the Jews continued quiet under them  but he thought it best himself to send one of his intimate friends before hand to see the state of affairs and to give him a faithful account of the intention of the Jews Accordingly he sent one of his tribunes whose name Was Neopolitanus who met with king Agrippa as he was re turning from Alexandria at Jamnia and told him who it was that sent him and oa what errands he was sent 2 And here it was that the high priests and men of power among the jews as well as the sanhedrim came to congratulate the king upon his safe return and after they had paid him their respects they lamented their own calamities and related to him what barbarous treatment they had met with from Florus At which barbarity Agrippa had great indignation but transferred after a subtle manner his anger towards those Jews whom he really pitied that he might beat down their high thoughts of themselves and would have them believe that they had not been so unjustly treated in order to dissuade them from avenging themselves So these great men as of better under Standing than the rest and desirous of peace because of the pos sessions they had understood that this rebuke which the king gave them was intended for their good but as to the people 3 E 2 they 404 WARS OF THE JEWS Book If they came sixty furlongs out of Jerusalem and congratulated both Agrippa and Neopolitanus  but the wives of those that had been slain came running first of all and lamenting The people also when they hard their mourning fell into lamenta tions also and besought Agrippa to assist them thej also cried out to Neopolitanus and complained of them any miseries they had endured under Florus and they shewed them when they were come into the city how the market place was made deso late and the houses plundered They then pursuaded Neopoli tanus by the means of Agrippa that he would walk round the city with one only servant as far as Siloam that he might inform himself that the Jews submmited to all the rest of the Ro mans and were only displeased at Florus by reason of his ex ceeding barbarity to them So he walked round and had suf ficient experience of the good temper the people were in and then went up to the temple where he called the multitude to gether and highly commended them for their fidelity to the Romans and earnestly exhorted them to keep the peace and having performed such parts of divine worship at the temple as he was allowed to do he returned to Cestius 3 But as for the multitude of the Jews they addressed them selves to the king and to the high priests and desired they might have leave to send ambassadors to Nero against Florus and not by their silence afford a suspicion that they had been the occa sions of such great slaughters as had been made and were dis posed to revolt alleging that they should seem to have been the first beginners of the war if they did not prevent the report by shewing who it was that began it and it appeared openly that they would not be queit if any body should hinder them from sending such an ambassage But Agrippa although he thought it too dangerous a thing for them to appoint men to go as the accusers of Florus yet did he not think it fit for him to over look them as they were in a disposition for war He therefore called the multitude together into a large gallery and placed his sister Bernice in the house of the Asamoneans that she might be seen by them which house was over the gallery at Che pas sage to the upper city where the bridge joined the temple to the gallery and spake to them as follows  4   Had I perceived that you were all zealously disposed  to  In this speech of King Agrippa we have an authentic account of the extent and strength of the Roman empire when the Jewish war began And this speech  with other circumstances in Josephus demonstrate how wise and how great a perr son Agrippa was and why Josephus elsewhere calls him QxuiAxffiwr roSi a  most  wonderful or  admirable man Contr Ap I 9 He is the same Agrippa who said to Paul Â Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian Acts zxvi jg Chap XVI WARS OF THE JEWS 4o5  to go to war with the Romans and that the purer and more  sincere part of the people did not propose to live in peace I  had not come out to you nor been so bold as to give you  counsel for all discourses that tend to persuade men to do  what they ought to do is superfluous when the hearers ard  agreed to do the contrary But because some are earnest to  go to war because they are young and without experience of  the miseries it brings and because some are for it out of an  unreasonable expectation of regaining their liberty and be  cause others hope to get by it and are therefore earnestly  bent upon it that in the confusion of your affairs they may  gain what belongs to those that are too weak to resist them  I have thought proper to get you all together and to say to  you what I think to be for your advantage that so the for  mer may grow wiser and change their minds and that the  best men may come to no harm by the ill conduct of some  others And let not any one be tumultuous against me in  case what they hear me say do not please them for as to Â those that admit of no cure but are resolved upon a revolt  it will still be in their power to retain the same sentiments af  ter my exhortation is over but still my discourse will fall to Â the ground even with a relation to those that have a mind  to hear me unless you will all keep silence I am well aware  that they make a tragical exclamation concerning the injuâ  ries that have been offered you by your procurators and con  cerning the glorious advantages of liberty  but before I begin  the inquiry who you are that must goto war and who they  are against whom you must fight 1 shall first separate those  pretences that are by some connected together for if you  aim at avenging yourselves on those that have done you in  jury why do you pretend this to be a war for recovering  your and of whom St Paul said  He was expert in all the custom and questions of the  Jews ver 3 See another intimation of the limits of the same Roman empire of the War B III ch v Â 7 vol III But what seems to me very remarkable here is this that when Josephus in imitation of the Greeks and Romans for whose use he wrote his Antiquities did himself frequently compose the speeches which he put into their mouths they appear by the politeness of their composition and their flights of oratory to be not the real speeches of the persons concerned who usually were no orators but of his own elegant composure the speech before us is of another nature full of undeniable facts and composed in a plain and unartful but moving way so it appears to be King Agrippa s own speech and to have been given Josephus by Agrippa himself with whom Josephus had the greatest friendship Nor may we admit Agrippa s constant doctrine here that this vast Roman empire was raised and supported by divine Providence and that therefore jt was in vain for the Jews or any others to think of destroying it Nor may we neglect to take notice of Agrippa s solemn appeal to the angels here used the like appeals to which we have in St Paul i Tim v n and by the apostles in general in the form of the ordination of Bishops Constitut Apost VIII 4 Â oÂ WAts or THE JEWS  â Book II  your liberty but if you think all servitude intolerable to  what purpose serve your complaint against your particular Â governors for if they treated you with moderation it would  still be equally an unworthy thing to be in servitude Con  sidernow the several cases that may be supposed how little oc  casion there is for your going to war Your first occasion is the  accusations you have to make against your procurators now  here you ought to be submissive to those in authority and  not give them any provocation but when you repfoach men  greatly for small offences you excite thos e whom you re  proach to be your adversaries for this will only make them  leave off hurting you privately and with some degree of mo  desty and to lay what you have waste openly Now no  thing so much damps the force of strokes as bearing them  with patience and the quietness of those who are injured di  verts the injurious persons from afflicting But let us tak  it for granted that the Roman ministers are injurious to you  and are incurably severe yet are they not all the Romans  who thus injure you nor hath Caesar against whom you  are going to make war injured you it is not by their com  n iand that any wicked governor is sent to you for they who  are in the west cannot see those that are in the east nor in  deed is it easy for them there even to hear what is done in  those parts Now it is absurd to make war with a great many  for the sake of one to do so with such mighty people for  a small cause and this when these people are not able to Â know of what you complain nay such crimes as we com  plain of may soon be corrected for the same procurator will  not continue for ever  and probable it is that the successors  will come with more moderate inclinations But as for war  if it be once begun it is not easily laid down again nor borne  without calamities coming therewith However as to the  desire of recovering your liberty it is unseasonable to indulge  it so late  whereas you ought to have laboured earnestly in  old time that you might never have lost it for the first ex  perience of slavery was hard to be endured and the struggle  that you might never have been subject to it would have been  just but that slave who hath been once brought into subjee  tion and then runs away is rather a refractory slave than a  lover of liberty for it was then the proper time for doing all  that was possible that you might never have admitted the  Romans into your city when Pompey came first into the  country But so it was that so our ancestors and their kings  who were in much better circumstances than we are both as  to money and strong bodies and valiant J souls did not  bear Chap XVI WARS OF THE JEWS 44 T  bear the onset of a small body of the Roman army And yet  you who have not accustomed yourselves to obedience from  one generation to another and who are so much inferior to  those who first submitted in your circumstances will venture  to oppose the entire empire of the Romans while those A  thenians who in order to preserve the liberty of Greece  did once set fire to their own city who pursued Xerxes  that proud prince when he sailed upon the land and walked  upon the sea and could not be contained by the seas but  conducted such an army as was too broad for Europe and  made him run away like a fugitive in a single ship and brake  so great a part of Asia at the lesser Salamis are yet at this rtime servants to the Romans and those injunctions which  are sent from Italy become laws to the principal governing  city of Greece Those Lacedemonians also who got the  great victories at Thermopylae and Platea and had Agesilaus  for their king and searched every corner of Asia are con  tented to admit the same lords These Macedonians alsoj who  still fancy what great men their Philip and Alexander were  and see that the latter had promised them the empire over  the world these bear so great a change and pay their obe  dience to those whom fortune hath advanced in their stead  Moreover ten thousand other nations there are who had  greater reason than we to claim their entire liberty and yet  do submit You are the only people who think it a disgrace Â to be servants to those to whom all the world hath submitted Â What sort of an army do you rely on What are the arms  you depend on  Where is your fleet that may seize upon Â the Roman seas and where are those treasures which may  be sufficient for your undertakings  Do you suppose I pray  you that you are to make war with the Egyptians and with  the Arabians Will you not carefully reflect upon the Ro Â man empire Will you not estimate your own weakness  Hath not your army been often beaten even by your neigh  bouring nations while the power of the Romans is invinci  ble in all parts of the habitable earth nay rather they seek  for somewhat still beyond that for all Euphrates is not a sufti  cient boundary for them on the east side nor the Danube on  the north and for their southern limit Libya hath beensearch  ed over by them as far as countries uninhabited as is Cadiz  their limit on the west nay indeed they have sought for an  other habitable earth beyond the ocean and have carried Â their arms as far as such British islands as were never known  before What therefore do you pretend to Are you richer  than the Gauls stronger than the Germans wiser than the  Greeks 408 WARS OF THE JEW3 Book II  Greeks more numerous than all men upon the habitable  earth  What confidence is it that elevates you to oppose the  Romans Perhaps it will be said it is hard to endure slave  ry Yes but how much harder is this to the Greeks who  were esteemed the noblest of all people under the sun These  though they inhabit in a large country are in subjection to  six bundles of Roman rods It is the same case with the Ma  cedonians who have juster reason to claim their liberty than  you have What is the case of five hundred cities of Asia   do they not submit to a single governor and to the consular  bundle of rods What need I speak of the Heniochi and  Cholchi and the nation of Tauri those that inhabit the Bos  phori s and the nations about Pontus and Meotis who for  merly knew not so much as a lord of their own but are now  subject to three thousand armed men and where forty long  ships keep the sea in peace which before was not navigable  and very tempestuous How strong a plea may Bithynia  and Cappadocia and the people of Pamphylia the Lycians  and Cilicians put in for liberty But they are made tribu  tary without an army What are the circumstances of the  Thracians whose country extends in breadth five days jour  ney aad in length seven and is of a much more harsh consti  tution and much more defensible than yours and by the ri  gour of its cold sufficient to keep off armies from attacking  them do not they submit to two thousand men of the Ro  man garrisons Are not the Illyrians who inhabit the coun  try adjoining as far as Dalmatia and the Danube governed  by barely two legions by which also they put a stop to the  incursions of the Dacians And for the Dalmatians who  have made such frequent insurrections in order to regain their  liberty and who could never before be so thoroughly sub  dued but that they always gathered their forces together a gain and revolted yet are they now very quiet under one Ro mon legion Moreover if great advantages might provoke any people to revolt the Gauls might do it best of all as being  so thoroughly walled round by nature On the east side by the  Alps on the north by the riverRhine on the south by the Py  renean mountains and on the westby theocean Nowalthough  theseGauls have such obstacles before them to prevent any at  tack upon them and have no fewer than three hundred and  five nations among them nay have as one may say the foun  tains of domestic happiness within themselves and send out  plentiful streams of happiness over almost the whole world  these bear to be tributary to the Romans and derive their  prosperous condition from them and they undergo this not  became Chap XVI WAfts OF THE JEWS 409 Â because they are of effeminate minds or because they are of  an ignoble stock as having borne a war of eighty years in  order to preserve their liberty but by reason of the great  regard they have to the power of the Romans and their good  fortune which is of greater efficacy than their arms These  Gauls therefore are kept in servitude by twelve hundred sol  diers which are hardly so many as are their cities nor hath  the gold dug out of the mines of Spain been sufficient for the  support of a war to preserve their liberty nor could their  vast distance from the Romans by land and by sea do it nor  could the martial tribes of the Lusitanians and Spaniards  escape no more could the ocean with its tide which yet was  terrible to the ancient inhabitants Nay the Romans have  extended their arms beyond the pillars of Hercules and have Â walked among the clouds upon the Pyrenean mountains and  have subdued these nations And one legion is a sufficient  guard for these people although they were so hard to be con  quered and at a distance so remote from Rome Who is  there among you who hath not heard of the great number of  the Germans  You have to be sure yourselves seen them  to be strong and tall and that frequently since the Romans  have them among their captives every where yet these  Germans who dwell in an immense country who have minds  greater than their bodies and a soul that despises death  and who are in rage more fierce than wild beasts have the Rhine for the boundary of their enterprises and are tamed by eight Roman legions Such of them as were taken cap tive became their servants  and the rest of the entire nation were obliged to save themselves by flight Do you also who depend on the walls of Jerusalem consider what a wall the Britons had for the Romans sailed away to them and sub  dued them while they were encompassed by the ocean and in  habited an island that is not less than the continent of this  habitable earth and four legions are a sufficient guard to so  large an island And why should I speak much more about Â this matter while the Parthians that most warlike body of  men and lords of so many nations and encompassed with such  mighty forces send hostages to the Romans whereby you  may see if you please even in Italy the noblest nation of the  east under the notion of peace submitting to serve them Now â when almost all people under the sun submit to the Roman  arms will you be the only people that make war against  them and this without regarding the fate of the Carthagi  nians who in the midst of the brags of the great Hannibal Â Â and the nobility of their Phenician original jfell by the hand VOL III 3 F gf WARS OF THE JEWS Book II I  of Scipio Nor indeed have the Cyrenians derived from the  Lacedemonians nor the Marmaridae a nation extended as far  as the regions uninhabitable for want of water nor have the  Syrtes a place terrible to such as barely tear it described  the Nasamons and Moors and the immense multitude of the  Numidians been able to put a stop to the Roman valour  And as for the third part of the habitable earth Africa  whose nations are so many that it is not easy to number them  and which is bounded by the Atlantic sea and the pillars of  Hercules and feeds an innumberable multitude of Ethiopians  as far as the Red Sea these have the Romans subdued entire  ly And besides the annual fruits of the earth which main  tain the multitude of the Romans for eight months in the  year this over and above pays all sorts of tribute and af  fords revenues suitable to the necessities of the government  Nor do they like you esteem such injunctions a disgrace to  them although they have but one Roman legion that abides  among them And indeed what occasion is there for shew  ing you the power of the Romans over remote countries 1 when jt is so easy to learn it from Egypt in your neighbour  hood  This country is extended as far as the Ethiopians  and Arabia the Happy and borders upon India it hath se  ven millions five hundred thousand men besides the inhabi  tants of Alexandria as may be learned from the revenue of  the pole tax yet it is not ashamed to submit to the Roman  government although it hath Alexandria as a grand tempta  tion to a revolt by reason it is so full of people and of rich  es and is besides exceeding large its length being thirty fur  longs and its breadth no less than ten and it pays more tri  bute to the Romans in one month than you do in a year nay  besides what it pays in money it sends corn to Rome that  supports it for four months in the year it is also walled  round on all sides either by almost impassible deserts or seas 11 that have no havens or by rivers or by lakes yet have none  of these things been found too strong for the Roman good Â fortune however two legions that lie in that city are a bri  die both for the remoter parts of Egypt and for the parts in  habited by the more noble Maced mans Where then are  those people whom you are to have for your auxiliaries   Must they come from the parts of the world that are uiiin Â Â habited for all that are in the habitable earth are under the  Romans Unless any of you extend his hopes as far as beyond  the Euphrates and suppose that those of your own nation that  dwell in Adiabene will come to your assistance but certain  ly those will not embarrass themselves with an unjustifiable war Chap XVI WARS OF THE JEWS  war nor if they should follow such ill advice will the Par  thians permit them so to do for it is their concern to main  tain the truce that is between them and the Romans and  they will be supposed to break the covenants between  them if any under their government march against the Ro  mans What remains therefore is this that you have re  course to divine assistance but this is already on the side of 1 the Romans for it is impossible that so vast an empire should  be settled without God s providence Reflect upon it how  impossible it is for your zealous observations of your religi  ous customs to be here preserved which are hard to be ob  served even when you fight with those whom you are able to  conquer and how can you then most of all hope for God s  assistance when by being forced to transgress his law you  will make him turn his face from you and if you do ob  serve the custom of the Sabbath days and will not be prevailed  on to do any thing thereon you will easily be taken as were  your forefathers by Pompey who was the busiest in his siege  on those days on which the besieged rested But if in time  of war you transgress the law of your country I cannot tell  on whose account you will afterward go to war for your con  cern is but one that you do nothing against any of your fore  fathers and how will you call upon God to assist you when  you are voluntarily transgressing against his religion  Now all men that go to war do it either as depending on divine or  on human assistance but since your going to war will cut off  both those assistances those that are for going to war choose  evident destruction What hinders you from slaying your  children and wives with your own hands and burning this  most excellent native city of yours for by this mad prank  you will however escape the reproach of being beaten But  it were best O my friends it were best while the vessel is  still in the haven to foresee the impending storm and not to set sail out of the port into the middle of the hurricanes for  we justly pity those who fall into great misfortunes without  foreseeing them  but for him who rushes into manifest ruin  he gains reproaches instead of commiseration But cer  tainly no one can imagine that you can enter into a war as by  agreement or that when the Romans have got you under their  power they will use you with moderation or will not ratherj  for an example to other nations burn your holy city andjut  terly destroy your whole nation for those of you who shall  survive the war will not be able to find a place whither to  flee since all men have the Romans for their lords already or  are afraid they shall have hereafter Nay indeed the danger 3 F 2  concerns 412 WARS OF THE JEWS Book II  concerns not those Jews that dwell here only but those of  them which dwell in others cities also for there is no people  upon the habitable earth which have not some portion of you  among them whom your enemies will slay in case you go to  war and on that account also and so every city which hath  Jews in it will be filled with slaughter for the sakeof afew men  and they who slay them will be pardoned but if that slaugh  ter be not made by them consider how wicked a thing it is  to take arms against those that are so kind to you Have pity  therefore if not on your and children wives yet upon this  your metropolis and its sacred walls spare the temple and  preserve the holy house with its holy furniture for yourselves  for if the Romans get you under their power they will no  longer abstain from them when their former abstinence shall  have been so ungratefully requitted I call to witness your  sanctuary and the holy angels of God and this country com  mon to us all that I have not kept back any thing that is for  your preservation  and if you will follow that advice which  you ought to do you will have that peace which will be  common to you and to me but if you indulge your pas Â sions you will run those hazards which I shall be free from 5 When Agrippahadspoken thus both he and hissister wept and by their tears repressed a great deal of the violence of the people but still they cried out That  they would not fight a Â gainst the Romans but against Florus on account of what Â they had suffered by his means To which Agrippa replied Â that what they had already done was like such as make war Â i against the Romans for you have not paid the  tribute Â Â which is due to Caesar and you have cut off the cloisters of Â i the temple from joining to the tower Antonia You will Â therefore prevent any occasion of revolt if you will but join Â these together again and if you will but pay your tribute  for the citadol does not now belong to Florus nor are you to  pay the tribute money to Florus   CHAP XVII Hotv tie war of tbf Jews with the Romans began And con cerning Manabem 9 1 r I i HIS advice the people hearkened to and went up into â L the temple with the king and Bernice and began to rebuild the cloisters the rulers also and senators divided them i selves  Julius C tsar had decreed that the Jew of Jerusalem should pay an annual tribute to the Romans excepting the city Joppa and for the Sabbatical year  a Spanheim observes from the Antiq B XIV ch x Â 6 vol II Chap XVII WARS OF THE JEWS 413 selves into the villages and collected the tributes and soongot together forty talents which was the sum that was deficient And thus did Agrippa then put a stop to that war which was threatened Moreover he attempted to persuade the multitude to obey Florus until Caesar should send one to succeed him but they were hereby more provoked and cast reproaches upon the king and got him excluded out of the city nay some of the seditious had the impudence to throw stones at him So when the king saw that the violence of those that were for in novations was not to be restrained and being very angry at the contumelies he had received he sent their rulers together with their men of power to Florus to Cesarea that he might appoint whom he thought fit to collect the tribute in the coun try while he retired into his own kingdom 2 And at this time it was that some of those that principally excited the people to go to war made an assault upon a certain fortress called Massada They took it by treachery and slew the Romans that were there and put others of their own party to keep it At the same time Eleazar the son of Ananias the high priest a very bold youth who was at that time governor of the temple persuaded those that officiated in the divine ser vice to receive no gift or sacrifice for any foreigner And this was the true beginning of our war with the Romans for they rejected the sacrifice of Caesar on this account and when many of the high priests and principal men besought them not to omit the sacrifice which it was customary for them to offer for their princes they would not be prevailed upon These relied much upon their multitude for the most flourishing part of the innovators assisted them but they had the chief re gard to Eleazar the governor of the temple 3 Hereupon the men of power got together and conferred with the high priests as did also the principal of the Pharisees and thinking all was at stake and that their calamities were be coming incurable took counsel what was to be done Accord ingly they determined to try what they could do with the sedi tious by words and assembled the people before the brazen gate which was that gate of the inner temple court of the priests which looked toward the sun rising And in the first place they shewed the great indignation they had at this attempt for a revolt and for their bringing so great a war upon their country after which they confuted their pretence as unjusti fiable and told them That  their forefathers had adorned their  temple in great part with donations bestowed on them by fo  rejgners and had always received what had been presented to f tjiem frpm foreign Rations and hat they had been so far from l  rejecting WARS Of THE JEWS Book II  rejecting any person s sacrifice which would be the highest  instance of impiety that they had themselves placed those  donations about the temple which were still visible and had  remained there so long a time that they did now irritate the  Romans to take arms against them and invited them to make  war upon them and brought up novel rulersof a strange divine  worship and determineci to run the hazard of having their  city condemned for impiety while they would not allow any  foreigner but Jews only either to sacrifice or to worship there  in And if such a law should be introduced in the case of a tf single private person only he would have indignation at it as Â an instance of inhumanity determined against him while they  have no regard to the Romans or to Ceesar and forbid even  their oblations to be received also that however they cannot  but fear lest by his rejecting their sacrifices they shall not be allowed to offer their own and that this city will lose its  principality unless they grow wiser quickly and restore the sacrifices as formerly and indeed amend the injury they  have offered foreigners before the report of it comes to the ears of those that have been injured 4 And as they said these things they produced those priests that Were skilful in the customs of their country who made the report That  all their forefathers had received the sacrifices  from foreign nations But still not one of the innovators would hearken to what was said nay those that ministered a bout the temple would not attend their divine service but were preparing matters for beginning the war So the men of power perceiving that the sedition was too hard for them to subdue and that the danger which would arise from the Romans would come upon them first of all endeavoured to save themselves and sent ambassadors some to Florus the chief of which was Simon the son of Ananias and others to Agrippa among whom the most eminent were Saul and Antipas and Costobarus who were of the king s kin dred and they desired of them both that they would come with an army to the city and cut off the sedition be fore it should be too hard to be subdued Now this terrible message was good news to Florus and because his design was to have a war kindled he gave the ambassadors no answer at all But Agrippa was equally Solicitous for those that were revolt ing and for those against whom the war was to be made and was dtesirous to preserve the Jews for the Romans and the tem ple a n J metropolis for the Jews he was also sensible that it was not for his own advantage that the disturbances should proceed so he sent three thousand horsemen to the assistance of the peo j out of Auranitis and Ba tanea and Trachonitis and these â d i rj j under Chap XVII WARS OF THE jÂ xyÂ under Darius the master of his horse and Philip the son of JaÂ cimus the general of his army 5 Upon this the men of power with the high priests as also all the part of the multitude that were desirous of peace took courage and seized upon the upper city Mount Sion j for the seditious part had the lower city and the temple in their power so they made use of stones and slings perpetually against one another and threw darts continually on both sides and sometimes it happened that they made incursions by troops and fought it jout hand to hand while the seditious were superior in boldness but the king s soldiers in skill These last strove chiefly to gain the temple and to drive those out of it who profaned it as did the seditious with Eleazar besides what they had already la bour to gain the upper city Thus were there perpetual slaugh ters on both sides for seven days time j but neither side would yield up the parts they had seized on  j 6 Now the next day was the festival of Xylophory upon which the custom was for every one to bring wood for the altar that there might never be a want of fuel for that fire which was unquenchable audalways burning upon that day they excluded the opposite party from the observation of this part of religion And when they had joined to themselves many of the Sicarii who crowded in among the weaker people that was the name for such robbers as had under their bosoms swords called Sicx they grew bolder and carried their undertaking farther  inso much that the king s soldiers were overpowered by their mul titude and boldness and so they gave way and were driven out of the upper city by force The others then set fire to the house of Ananias the high priest and to the palaces of Agrippa and Bernice after which they carried the fire to the place where the archives were reposited and made haste to burn the contracts be longing to their creditors and thereby to dissolve their obliga tions for paying their debts and this was done in order to gain the multitude of those who had been deb tors and that they might persuade the poorer sort to join in their insurrection with safetv against the more wealthy j so the keepers of the records fled away and the rest set fire to them And when they had thus burnt down the nerves of the city they fell upon their enemies at which time some of the men of power and of the high priests went into the vaults under ground and concealed themselves while others fled with the king s soldiers to the upper palace and shut the gates immediately  among whom were A nanias the high priest and the ambassadors that had been sent to Agrippa And now the seditious were contented with the victory they had gotten 418 WARS OF THE JEWS Book If gotten and the buildings they had burnt down and proceeded no farther 7 But on the next day which was the fifteenth of the month Lous Ab they made an assault upon Antonia and besieged the garrison which was in it two days and then took the garri son and slew them and set the citadel on fire after which they inarched to the palace whither the king s soldiers were fled and parted themselves into four bodies and made an attack upon the walls As for those that were within it no one had the courage to sally out because those that assaulted them were so numerous but they distributed themselves into the breast works and tur rets and shot at the besiegers whereby many of the robbers fell under the walls nor did they cease to fight one with another either by night or by day while the seditious supposed that those within would grow weary for want of food and those without supposed the others would do the like by the tediousness of the siege 8 In the mean time one Manahem the son of Judas that was called the Galilean who was a very cunning sophister and had formerly reproached the Jews under Cyrenius that after God they were subject to the Romans took some of the men of note with him and retired toMassada where he broke open King He rod s armoury and gave arms not only to his own people but to other robbers also These he made use of for a guard and re turned in the state of a king to Jerusalem he became the leader of the sedition and gave orders for continuing the siege but they wanted proper instruments and it was not practicable to under mine the wall because the darts came down upon them from above But still they dug a mine from a great distance under one of the towers and made it totter and having done that they set fire on what was combustible and left it and when the founda tions were burnt below the tower fell down suddenly Yet did they then meet with another wall that had been built within for the besieged were sensible beforehand of what they were doing and probably die tower shook as it was undermining so they provided themselves of another fortification  which when the besiegers unexpectedly saw while they thought they had already gained the place they were under some consternation However those that were within sent to Manahem and to the other lead ers of the sedition and desired they might go out upon a capitu lation  this was granted to the king s soldiers and their own countrymen only who went out accordingly  but the Romans that were left alonÂ were greatly dejected for they were not able to force their way through such a multitude  and to desire them to give them their right hand for their security they thought Chap XVII WARS OF THE JEWS 41T thought it would be a reproach to them and besides if they should give it them they durst not depend upon it so they de serted their camp as easily taken and ran away to the royal towers that called Hippicus that called Phas lus and that call ed Mariamne But Manahem and his party fell upon the place whence the soldiers were fled and slew as many of them as they could catch before they got up to the towers and plundered what they left behind them and set fire to their camp This was executed on the sixth day of the month Gorpieus Elul 9 But on the next day the high priest was caught where he had concealed himself in an aqueduct he was slain together with Hezekiah his brother by the robbers hereupon the sedi tious besieged the towers and kept them guarded lest any one of the soldiers should escape Now the overthrow of the places of strength and the death of the high priest Ananias so puffed up Manahem that he became barbarously cruel and as he thought he had no antagonist to dispute the management of af fairs with him he was no better than an insupportable tyrant but Eleazar and his party when words had passed between them how  It was not proper when they revolted from the  Romans out of the desire of liberty to betray that liberty to  any of their own people and to bear a lord who though he  should be guilty of no violence was yet meaner than thern  selves as also that in case they were obliged to set some one  over their public affairs it was fitter they should give that  privilege to any one rather than to him they made an as sault upon him in the temple for he went up thither to worship in a pompous manner and adorned with royal garments and had his followers with him in their armour But Eleazar and his party fell violently upon him as did also the rest of the people and taking up stones to attack him withal they threw them at the sophister and thought that if he were once ruined the en tire sedition would fall to the ground Now Manahem and his party made resistance for a while but when they perceived that the whole multitude were falling upon them they fled which way every one was able those that were caught were slain and those that hid themselves were searched for A few there were of them who privately escaped to Masada among whom was Eleazar the son of Jairus who wasof kin to Manahem andacted the part of a tyrant at Masada afterward as for Manahem him self he ran away to the place called Ophla and there lay skulk ing in private but they took him alive and drew him out be fore them all they then tortured him with many sorts of tor ments and after all slew him as they did by those that were VOL III 3 G captains 418 WARS or THE JEWS Book II captains under him also and particularly by the principal in strument of his tyranny whose name was Apsulom 10 And as 1 said so far truly the people assisted them while they hoped this might afford some amendment to the se ditious practices but the others were not in haste to put an end to the war but hoped to prosecute it with less danger now they had slain Manahem It is true that when the people earnestly desired that they would leave off besieging the soldiers they were the more earnest in pressing it forward and this till Metilius who was the Roman general sent toEleazar and de sired that they would give them security to spare their lives only but agreed to deliver up their arms and what else they had with them The others readily complied with their peti tion sent to them Gorion the son of Nicodemus and Ananias the son of Sadduk and Judas the son of Jonathan that they might give them the security of their right hands and of their oaths after which Metilius brought down his soldiers which soldiers while they were in arms were not meddled with by any of the seditious nor was there any appearance of treachery  but as soon as according to the articles of capitulation they had all laid down their shields and their swords and were un der no farther suspision of any harm but were going away Eleazar s men attacked them after a violent manner and en compassed them round and slew them while they neither de fended themselves nor entreated for mercy but only cried out upon the breach of their articles of capitulation and their oaths And thus were all these men barbarously murdered excepting Metilius for when he entreated for mercy and promised that he would turn Jew and be circumcised they saved him alive but none else This loss to the Romans was but light there being no more than a few slain out of an immense army  but still it appeared to be a prelude to the Jews own destruction while men made public lamentation when they saw that such occasions were afforded for a war as were incurable that the city was all over polluted with such abominations from which it was but reasonable to expect some vengeance even though they should escape reverence from the Romans  so that the city was filled with sadness and every one of the moderate men in it were under great disturbance as likely themselves to under go punishment for the wickedness of the seditious for indeed it so happened that this murder was perpetrated on the Sab bath day on which day the Jews have a respite from their works on account of divine worship CHAP Chap

emptied of its Jewish inhabitants for Florus caught such as ran away and sent them in bonds to the gallies Upon which stroke that the Jews received at Cesarea the whole nation was greatly enraged so they divided themselves into several parties and laid waste the villages of the Syrians and their neighbouring cities Philadelphia and Sebonitis and Gerasa and Pella and Scythopolis and after them Gadara and Hippos and falling upon Gaulanitis some cities they de stroyed there and some they set on fire and then went to Keda sa belonging to the Tyrians and to Ptolemais and to Gaba and to Gesarea nor was either Sebaste Samaria or Askelon able to oppose the violence with which they were attacked and when they had burnt these to the ground they entirely demolished Anthedon and Gaza many also of the villages that were about every one of those cities were plundered and an immense slaughter was made of the men who were caught in them 2 However the Syrians were even with the Jews in the mul titude of the men whom they slew for they killed those whom they caught in their cities and that not only out of the hatred they bear them as formerly but to prevent the danger under which they were from them so that the soldiers in all Syria were terrible and every city was divided into two armies en camped one against another and the preservation of the one party was in the destruction of the other so the day time was spent in shedding of blood and the night in fear which was of the two the more terrible for when the Syrians thought they had ruined the Jews they had the Judaizer s in suspicion also and as each side did not care to slay those whom they only suspected on the other so did they greatly fear them when they were ming led with the other as if they were certainly foreigners More over greediness of gain was a provocation to kill the opposite party even to such of old as had appeared very mild and gentl towards them for they without fear plundered the effects of the slain and carried off the spoils of those whom they slew to their own houses as if they had been gained in a set battle and he was esteemed a man of honour who got the greatest share as having prevailed over the greatest number of his enemies It 3 G 2 was 4tO WARS OF THE JEWS Uook IL was then common to see cities filled with dead bodies still lying unburied and those of old men mixed with infants all dead and scattered about together women also lay amongst them without any covering for their nakedness you might then see the whole province full of inexpressible calamities while the dread of still more barbarous practices which were threatened were every where greater than what had been already per petrated 3 And thus far the conflict had been between Jews and foreigners but when they made excursions to Scythopolis they found Jews that acted as enemies for as they stood in battle array with those of Scythopqlis and preferred their own safety before their relation to us theyfought against their own country men  nay their alacrity was so very great that those of Scytho polis suspected them These were afraid therefore lest they should make an assault upon the city in the night time and to their great misfortune should thereby make an apology for themselves to their own people for their revolt from them So they commanded them that in case they would confirm their agreement and demonstrate their fidelity to them who were of a different nation they should go out of the city with their fa milies to a neighbouring grove and when they had done as they were commanded without suspecting any thing the people of Scythopolis lay still for the interval of two days to tempt them to be secure but on the third night they watched their opportunity and cut all their throats some as they lay unguard ed and some as they lay asleep The number that was slain was above thirteen thousand and then they plundered them of all that they had 4 It will deserve our relation what befel Simon he was the son of one Saul a man of reputation among the Jews This man was distinguished from the rest by the strength of his body and the boldness of his conduct although he abused them both to the mischieving of his countrymen for he came every day and slew a great many of the Jews of Scythopolis and he fre quently put them to flight and became himself alone the cause of his army s conquering But a just punishment overtook him for the murders he had committed upon those of the same na tion with him for when the people of Scythopolis threw their darts at them in the grove he drew his sword but did not at tack any of the enemy for he saw that he could do nothing against such a multitude but he cried out after a very moving manner and  O you people of Scythopolis 1 deservedly suffer  for what 1 have done with relation to you when I gave you  such security of my fidelity to you by slaying so many of Â those Chap XVIII WARS OF THE JEWS 421 Â those that were related to me Wherefore we very justly  experience the perfidiousness of foreigners while we acted  after a most wicked manner against our own nation I will  therefore die polluted wretch as I am by mine own hands  for it is not fit I should die by the hand of our enemies  and  let the same action be to me both a punishment for my great  crimes and a testimony of my courage to my commendation  that so no one of our enemies may have it to brag of that he  it was that slew me and no one may insult upon me as I  fall Now when he had said this he looked round about him upon his family with eyes of commiseration and of rage that family consisted of a wife and children and his aged pa rents so in the first place he caught his father by the grey hairs and ran his sword through him and after him he did the same to his mother who willingly received it and after them he did the like to his wife and children every one almost offering themselves to his sword as desirous to prevent being slain by their enemies so when he had gone overall his family he stood upon their bodies to be seen by all and stretching out his right hand that his action might be observed by all he sheath ed his entire sword into his own bowels This young man was to be pitied on account of the strength of his body and the cour age of his soul but since he had assured foreigners of his fideli ty against his own countrymen he suffered deservedly 5 Besides this murder at Scythopolis the other cities rose up against the Jews that were among them those of Askalon slew two thousand five hundred and those of Ptolemaistwo thousand and put not a few into bonds those of Tyre also put a great number to death but kept a greater number in prison  more over those of Hippos and those of Gadara did the like while they put to death the boldest of the Jews but kept those of whom they were afraid in custody as did the rest of the cities of Syria according as they every one either hated them or were afraid of them only the Antiochians the Sidonians and Apa mians spared those that dwelt with them and would not en dure either to kill any of the Jews or to put them in bonds And perhaps they spared them because their own number was so great that they despised their attempts but I think the great est part of this favour was owing to their commiseration of those whom they saw to make no innovations As for the Gerasans they did no harm to those that abode with them and for those who had a mind to go away they conducted them as far as their borders reached 6 There was also a plot laid against the Jews in Agrippa s kingdom for he was himself gone to Cestius Gallus to An tioch 422 WARS OF THE JEWS Book It tioch but had left one of his companions whose name was Noarus to take care of the public affairs which Noarus was of kin to king Sohemus  Now there came certain men se venty in number out of Batanea who were the most considera ble for their families and prudence of the rest of the people  these desired to have an army put into their hands that if any tumult should happen they might have about them a guard sufficient to restrain such as might rise up against them This Noarus sent out some of the king s armed men by night and slew all those seventy men which bold action he ventured up on without the consent of Agrippa and was such a lover of mo ney that he chose to be so wicked to his own countrymen tho he brought ruin on the kingdom thereby and thus cruelly did he treat that nation and this contrary to the laws also until Agrippa was informed of it who did not indeed dare to put him to death out of regard to Sohemus but still he put an end to his procuratorship immediately But as to the seditious they took the citadel which was called Cypros and was above Jericho and cut the throats of the garrison and utterly demo lished the fortifications this was about the same time that the multitude of the jews that were at Macherus persuaded the Romans who were in garrison to leave the place and deliver it up to them These Romans being in great fear lest the place should be taken by force made an agreement with them to de part upon certain conditions and when they had obtained the security they desired they delivered up the citadel into which the people of Macherus put a garrison fer their own security and held it in their own power 7 But for Alexandria the sedition of the people of the place against the Jews was perpetual and this from that very time when Alexander the Great upon unding the readiness of the Jews in assisting him against the Egyptians and as a reward for such their assistance gave them equal privileges in this city with the Grecians themselves Which honourary reward con tinued among them under his successors who also set apart for them a particular place that they might live without being polluted by the Gentiles and were thereby not so much in termixed with foreigners as before they also gave them this farther privilege that they should be called Macedonians Nay when the Romans got possession of Egypt neither the first Cae sar nor any one that came after him thought of diminishing the honours  Of this Eohemus we have mention made by Tacitus We also learn from Dio that his father was king of the Arabians of Iturea which Iturea is mentioned by St Luke iii i both whose testimonies are quoted here by Dr Hudson Sec Noldius No 371 Chap XVIII WARS or THE JEWS 423 honours which Alexander had bestowed on the Jews But still conflicts perpetually arose with the Grecians and although the governors did every day punish many of them yet did the sedi tion grow worse  but at this time especially when there were tumults in other places also the disorders among them were put into a greater flame for when the Alexandrians had once a pub lic assembly to deliberate about an ambassage they were send ing to Nero a great number of Jews came flocking to the theatre  but when their adversaries saw them they immediate ly cried out and called them their enemies and said they came as spies upon them  upon which they rushed out and laid vio lent hands upon them  and as for the rest they were slain as they ran away  but there were three men whom they caught and hauled them along in order to have them burnt alive but all the Jews came in a body to defend them who at first threw stones at the Grecians but after that they took lamps and rushed with violence into the theatre and threatened that they would burn the people to a man and this they had soon done unless Tiberius Alexander the governor of the city had re strained their passions However this man did not begin to teach them wisdom by arms but sent among them privately some of the principal men and thereby entreated them to be  quiet and not provoke the Rdman army against them but the seditious made a jest of the entreaties of Tiberius and reproach ed him for so doing 8 Now when he perceived that those who were for innova tions would not be pacified till some great calamity should over take them he sent out upon them those two Romans legions that were in the city and together with them five thousand other soldiers who by chance were come together out of Libia to the ruin of the Jews They were also permitted not only to kill them but to plunder them of what they had and to set fire to their houses These soldiers rushed violently into that part of the city that was called Delta where the Jewish people lived together and did as they were bidden though not without bloodshed on their own side also for the Jews got together and set those that were the best armed among them in the forefront and made resistance for a great while but when once they gave back they were destroyed unmercifully and this their destruc tion was complete some being caught in the open field and others forced into their houses which houses were first plundered of what was in them and then set on fire by the Romans  wherein no mercy was shown to the infants and no regard had to the aged but they went on in the slaughter of persons of wery age till all the place was overflowed with blood and fifty â â   â â  thousand 424 WARS OF THE JEWS Book II thousand of them lay dead upon heaps  nor had the remainder been preserved had they not betaken themselves to supplication So Alexander commiserated their condition and gave orders to the Romans to retire accordingly these being accustomed to obey orders left off killing at the first intimation  but the po pulace of Alexandria bare so very great hatred to the Jews that it was difficult to recal them and it was an hard thing to make them leave their dead bodies 0 And this was the miserable calamity which at this time befel the Jews at Alexandria Hereupon Cestius thought fit no longer to lie still while the Jews were every where up in arms so he lookout of Antioch the twelfth legion entire and out of each of the rest he selected two thousand with six cohorts of footmen and four troops of horsemen besides those auxiliaries which were sent by the kings of which Antiochus sent two thousand horse men and three thousand footmen with as many archers  and Agrippa sent the same number of footmen and one thousand horsemen  Sohemus also followed with four thousand a third part whereof were horsemen but most part were archers and thus did he march to Ptolemais There were also great num bers of auxiliaries gathered together from the free cities who indeed had not the sameskillin martial affairs but madeupin their alacrity andin their hatred to the Jews what they wanted in skill There came also along with Cestius Agrippa himself both as a guide in his march of the country and a director what was fit to be done so Cestius took part of his forces and marched hastily to Zabulon a strong city of Galilee which was called the city of men and divides the country of Ptolemais from our nation this he found deserted by its men the multitude having fled to the mountains but full of all sorts of good things j those he gave leave to the soldiers to plunder and set fire to the city although it was of admirable beauty and had its houses built like those in Tyre and Sidon and Berytus After this he over ran all the country and seized upon whatsoever came in his way and set fire to the villages that were round about them and then return ed to Ptolemais But when the Syrians and especially those of Berytus were busy in plundering the Jews pulled up their cou rage again for they knew that Cestius was retired and fell upon those that were left behind unexpectedly and destroyed about two thousand of them 10 And now Cestiushimself marched from Ptolemais and came to Cesarea but he sent part of his army before him to Joppa and  Spanheim notes on the place that this later Antiochui who wai called Efi ptamei is mentioned by Dio LIX page 645 and that he is mentioned by Josi phus elsewhere twice alÂ o B V ch xi Â 3 vol 111 and Aatiq B XIX cb tiii  it vol III Chap XIX WARS OF THE JEWS 425 and gave order that if they could take that city by surprise they should keep it but that in case the citizens should perceive they were coming to attack them that they then should stay for him and for the rest of the army So some of them made a brisk march by the sea side and some by land and so coming up on them On both sides they took the city with ease and as the inhabitants had made no provision aforehand for a flight nor had gotten any thing ready for fighting the soldiers fell upon them and slew them all with their families and then plundered and burnt the city The number of the slain was eight thousand four hundred In like manner Cestius sent also a considerable body of horsemen to the toparchy of Narbatene that adjoined to Cesarea who destroyed the country and slew a great multi tude of its people they also plundered what they had and burnt their villages 11 But Cestius sent Gallus the commander of the twelfth legion into Galilee and delivered to him as many of his forces as he supposed sufficient to subdue that nation He was receiv ed by the strongest city of Galilee which was Sepphoris with acclamations of joy which wise conduct of that city occasioned the rest of the cities to be in quiet while the seditious part and the robbers ran away to that mountain which lies in the very middle of Galilee and is situated over against Sepphoris it is called Asamon So Gallus brought his forces against them but while those men were in the superior parts above the Ro iiians they easily threw their darts upon the Romans as they made their approaches and slew about two hundred of them But when the Romans had gone round the mountains and were gotten into the parts above their enemies the others were soon beaten nor could they who had only light armour on sustain the force of them that fought them armed all over nor when they u ere beaten could they escape the enemies horsemen in somuch that only some few concealed themselves in certain places hard to become at among the mountains while the rest above two thousand in number were slain CHAP XIX What Cestius did against the Jews  and how upon bis besieging Jerusalem he retreatedfrom the city without any just occasion in the world As also what severe calamities he under went from the Jews in his retreat  1 A ND now Gallus seeing nothing more that looked to Â wards an innovation in Galilee returned with his arany to Cesarea but Cestius removed with his whole army VOL III 3 H and 426 WARS or THE JEWS v Book 1L and marched to Antipatris And when he was informed that there was a great body of Jewish forces gotten together in a cer tain tower called sJpbet he sent a party before to fight them but this party dispersed the Jews by affrighting them before it came to a battle so they came and finding their camp deserted they burnt it as well as the villages that lay about it But when Cestius had marched from Antipatris to Lydda he found the city empty of its men for the  whole multitude were gone up to Jerusalem to the feast of tabernacles yet did he destroy fifty of those that shewed themselves and burnt the city and so marched forwards and ascending by Bethoron he pitched his camp at a certain place called Ga io fifty furlongs distant from Jerusalem 2 But as for the Jews when they saw the war approaching to their metropolis they left the feast and betook themselves to their arms and taking courage greatly from their multitude went in a sudden and disorderly manner to the fight with a great noise and without any consideration had of the rest of the seventh day although the Sabbath was the day to which they had the greatest regard but that rage which made them forget the reli gious observation of the Sabbath made them too hard for their enemies in the fight with such violence therefore did they fall upon the Romans as to break into their ranks and to march through the midst of them making a great slaughter as they went insomuch that unless the horsemen and such part of the footmen as were not yet tired in the action had wheeled round and succoured that part of the army which was not yet broken Cestius with his whole army had been in danger however five hundred and fifteen of the Romans were slain of which number four hundred were footmen and the rest horsemen while the Jews lost only twenty two of whom the most valiant were  Here we have in eminent example of that Jewish language which Dr Wall truly observes we several times find used in the sacred writings I mean where the words all or whole multitude c are used for much the greatest part only but not so as to include every person without exception for when Josephus had said that the whole multitude all the males of Lydda were gone to the feast of tabernacles he immediately adds that however no fewer than fifty of them appeared and were slain by the Romans Other examples somewhat like this I have observed elsewhere in Josephus but as I think npne so remarkable as this See Wall s Critical Obiervations on the Old Testament pag 49 jo We have also in this and the next section two eminent facts to be observed viz the first example that I remember in Josephus of the onset of the Jews enemies upon their country when their males were gone up to Jerusalem to one of their three sacred festivals which daring the theocracy God had promised to preserve them from Exod xxxiv 24 The second fact is this the breach of the Sabbath by the seditious Jews in an offensive fight contrary to the universal doctrine and practice of their nation in these ages and even contrary to what they themselves afterward practised in the rest of this war See the aote on Antiq B XVI ch 3 Â 4 vol H Chap XIX WARS or THE JEWS  437 were the kinsmen of Monobazus king of Adiabene and their names were Monobazus and Kenedius and next to them were Niger of Perea and Silas of Babylon who had deserted from King Agrippa to the Jews for he had formerly served in his army When the front of the Jewish army had been cut off the Jews retired into the city but still Simon the son of Gio ra fell upon the backs of the Romans as they were ascending up Bethoron and put the hindmost of the army inta disorder and carried off many of the beasts that carried the weapons of war and led them into the city But as Cestius tarried there three days the Jews seized upon the elevated parts of the city and set watches at the entrances into the city and appeared o penly resolved not to rest when once the Romans should begin to march 3 And now when Agrippa observed that even the affairs of the Rorhans were likely to be in danger while such an immense multitude of their enemies had seized upon the mountains round about he determined to try what the Jews would agree to by words as thinking that he should either persuade them all to de sist from fighting or however that he should cause the sober part of them to separate themselves from the opposite party So he sent Borceus and Phebus the persons of his party that were the best known to them and promised them that Cestius should give them his right hand to secure them of the Romans entire forgiveness of what they had done amiss if they would throw away their arms and come over to them but the seditious fearing lest the whole multitude in hopes of security to them selves should go over to Agrippa resolved immediately to fall upon and kill the ambassadors accordingly they slew Phebus before he said a word but Borceus was only wounded and so prevented his fate by flying away and when the people were very angry at this they had the seditious beaten with stones and clubs and drove them before them into the city 4 Sftit now Cestius observing that thedisturbances that were begun among the Jews afforded him a proper opportunity to at tack them took his whole army along with him and put the Jews to flight and pursued them to Jerusalem He then pitch ed his camp upon the elevation called Scopus or watch tower which was distant seven furlongs from the city yet did not he assault them in three days time out of expectation that those within might perhaps yield a little and in the mean time he sent out a great many of his soldiers into neighbouring villages to seize upon their corn And on the fourth day which was the thirtieth of the month Hyperbereteus TisriJ when he had put his army in array he brought it into the city Now for 3 H 2 the 428 WARS OF THE JEWS Book II the people they were kept under by the seditious but the se ditious themselves were greatly affrighted at the good order of the Romans and retired from the suburbs and retreated into the inner part of the city and into the temple But when Ces tius was come into the city he set the part called JSezetba which is called Cenopolis or the new city on fire as he did also to the timber market after which he came into the upper city and pitched his camp over against the royal palace and had he but at this very time attempted to get within the walls by force he had won the city presently and the war had been put an end to at once but Tyrannius Priscus the muster master of the army and a great number of the officers of the horse had been corrupted by Florus and diverted him from that his attempt and that was the occasion that this war lasted so very long and thereby the Jews were involved in such incurable calamities 5 In the mean time many of the principal men of the city were persuaded by Ananus the son of Jonathan and invited Cestius into the city and were about to open the gates for himj but he overlooked this offer partly out of his anger at the Jews and partly because he did not thoroughly believe they were in earnest whence it was that he delayed the matter so long that the seditious perceived the treachery and threw Ananus and those of his party down from the wall and pelting them with stones drove them into their houses but they stood themselves at proper distances in the towers and threw their darts at those that were getting over the wall Thus did the Romans make their attack against the wall for five days but to no purpose  but on the next day Cestius took a great many of his choicest men and with them the archers and attempted to break into the temple at the northern quarter of it but the Jews beat them off from the cloisters and repulsed them several times when they were gotten near to the wall till at length the multitude of the darts cut them off and made them retire but the first rank of the Romans rested their shields upon the wall and so did those that were behind them and the like did those that were still more backward and guarded themselves with what they call Testudo the back of a tortoise upon which the darts that were thrown fell and slided off without doing them any harm  so the soldiers undermined the wall without being themselves hurt and got all things ready for setting fire to the gate of the temple 6 And now it was that a horrible fear seized upon the sedi tious insomuch that many of them ran out of the city as though it were to be taken immediately but the people upon this took courage and where the wicked part of the city gave ground thither Chap XIX WARS OF THE JEWS 429 thither did they come in order to set open the gates and to ad mit Cestius as their benefactor who had he but continued the siege a little longer had certainly taken the city  but it was I suppose owing to the  aversion God had already at the city and the sanctuary that he was hindered from putting an end to the war that very day 7 It then happened that Cestius was not conscious either how the besieged despaired of success nor how courageous the peo ple were for him and so he recalled his soldiers from the place and by despairing of any expectation of taking it without having received any disgrace he retired from the city without any reason in the world But when the robbers perceived this un expected retreat of his they resumed their courage and ran af ter the hinder parts of his army and destroyed a considerable number of both their horsemen and footmen and now Cestius lay all night at the camp which was at Scopus and as he went off farther next day he thereby invited the enemy to follow him who still fell upon the hindmost and destroyed them they also fell upon the flank on each side of the army and threw darts up on them obliquely nor durst those that were hindmost turn back upon those who wounded them behind as imagining that the multitude of those that pursued them was immense  nor did they venture to drive away those that pressed uport them on each side because they were heavy with their arms and were afraid of breaking their ranks to pieces and because they saw the Jews were light and ready for making incursions upon them And this was the reason why the Romans suffered greatly with Â ut being able to revenge themselves upon their enemies  so they were galled all the way and their ranks were put into disorder and those that were thus put out of their ranks were slain  among whom were Priscus the commander of the sixth legion and Longinus the tribune and Emilius Secundus the commander  There may another very important and very providential reason be here assigned for this strange and foolish retreat of Cestius which if Josephus had been now a Christian he might probably have taken notice of also and that is the af fording the Jewish Christians in the city an opportunity of calling to mind the pre diction and caution given them by Christ about thirty three years and an half before that  when they should see the abomination of desolation the idolatrous Roman npassed with armies they i By complying wifh which those Jewish Christians fled to the mountains of Perea and escaped this destruction See Lit Accompl of Proph page 69 70 Nor waÂ there perhaps any one instance of a more unpolitic but more providential con duct than this retreat of Cestius visible during this whole siege of Jerusalem which yet was providentia v such a  great tribulation as had not been from the  beginning of the world to that time no nor ever should be Ibid page 7Â 71 430 WARS OF THE JEHTS Book II commander of a troop of horsemen So it was not without dif ficulty that they got to Gabao their former camp and that not without the loss of a great part of their baggage There it was that C stiiis staid two days and was in great distress to know what he should do in these circumstances  but when on the third day he saw a still much greater number of enemies and all the parts round about him full of Jews he understood that his delay was to his own detriment and that if he stayed any longer there he should have still more enemies upon him 8 That therefore he might fly the faster he gave orders to cast away what might hinder his army s march so they killed the mules and other creatures excepting thosethat carried their darts and machines which they retained for their own use and this principally because they were afraid lest the Jews should sieze upon them He then made his army march on as far as Bethoron Now the Jews did not so much press upon them when they were in large open places but when they were penn d up in their descent through narrow passages then did some of them get before and hindered them from getting out of them and others of them thrust the hinder most down into the lower places and the whole multitude extended themselves over against the neck of the passage and covered the Roman army with their darts In which circumstances as the footm enknew not how to defend themselves so the danger pressed the horse men still more for they were so pelted that they could not march along the road in their ranks and the ascents were so high that the cavalry were not able to march against the enemy the precipices also and valleys into which they frequently fell and tumbled down were such on each side of them that there were neither place for their flight nor any contrivance could be thought of for their defence  till the distress they were at last in was so great that they betook themselves to lamentations and to such mournful MICH as men use in the utmost despair the joyful acclamations of the Jews also as they encouraged one another echoed the sounds back again these last composing a noise of those that at once rejoiced and were in a rage Indeed things were come to such a pass that the Jews had almost taken Cestius s entire army prisoners had not the night come on when the Romans fled to Bethoron and the Jews seized upon all the places round about them and watched for their coming out in the morning 0 And then it was that Cestius despairing of obtaining room for a public march contrived how he might best run away and when he had selected four hundred of the most courageous of his soldiers he placed them at the strongest Â their fortifications Chap XX WARS OF THE JEWS 431 find gave order that when they went up to the morning guard they should erect their ensigns that the Jews might be made to believe that the entire army was there still while he himself took the rest of his forces with him and marched without any noise thirty furlongs But when the Jews perceived in the morning that the camp was empty they ran upon those four hundred who had deluded them and immediately threw their darts at them and slew them and they pursued after Cestius But he had already made use of a great part of the night in his flight and still marched quicker when it was day Insomuch that the soldiers through the astonishment and fear they were in left behind them their engines for sieges and for throwing of stones and a great part of the instruments of war So the Jews went on pursuing the Romans as far as Antipatris after which seeing they could not overtake them they came back and took the engines and spoiled the dead bodies and gathering their prey together which the Romans had left behind them and came back running and singing to their metropolis While they had themselves lost a few only but had slain of the Ro mans five thousand and three hundred footmen and three hund red and eighty horsemen This defeat happened on the eighth day of the month Dius Marhesvan in the twelfth year of the reign of Nero CHAP XX Cestius sends ambassadors to Nero The people of Damascus slay those Jews that lived with them The people of Jerusa lem after they had Jeft off pursuing Cestius return to

calamity had befallen Cestius many of the JL most eminent of the Jews swam away from the city as from a ship when it was going to sink Costobarus therefore and Saul who were brethren together with Philip the son of Jacimus who was the commander of King Agrippa s forces ran away from the city and went to Cestius But then how Anti pas who had been besieged with them in the king s palace he yvould not fly away with them was afterward slain by the sedi tious we shall relate hereafter However Cestius sent Saul and his friends at their own desire to Achaia to Nero to in form him of the great distress they were in and to lay the blame of their kindling the war upon Florus as hoping to alleviate Shis own danger by provoking his indignation against Florus 2 In 432 WARS OF THE JEWS Book II 2 In the mean time the people of Damascus when they were informed of the destruction of the Romans set about the slaughter of those Jews that were among them and as they had them already cooped up together in the place of public exercises which they had done out of the suspicion they had of them they thought they should meet with no difficulty in the attempt yet did they distrust their own wives which were almost all of them addicted to the Jewish religion on which account it was that their greatest concern was how they might conceal these things from them so they came upon the Jews and cut their throats as being in a narrow place in number ten thou sand and all of them unarmed and this in one hour s time without any body to disturb them 3 But as to those who had pursued after Cestius when they were returned back to Jerusalem they overbore some of those that favoured the Romans by violence and some they persuad ed by entreaties to join with them and got together in great numbers in the temple and appointed a great many generals for the war  Joseph also the son of Gorion and Ananus the high priest were chosen as governors of all affairs within the city and with a particular charge to repair the walls of the city for they did not ordain Eleazar the son of Simon to that office al though he had gotten into his possession the prey they had taken from the Romans and the money they had taken from Cestius together with a great part of the public treasures because they saw he was of a tyrannical temper and that his followers were in their behaviour like guards about him However the want they were in of Eleazar s money and the subtile tricks used by him brought all so about that the people were circumvented and submitted themselves to his authority in all public affairs 4 They also chose other generals for Idumea Jesus the son of Sapphias one of the high priests and Eleazar the son of Ananias the high priest they also enjoined Niger the then governor

was Ma nasseh to Perea and John the Essene to the toparchyof Thama na Lydda was also added to his portion and Joppa and Em maus But John the son of Matthias was made governor of the toparchies of Gophnitica and Acrabattene as was Josephus the son of Matthia s of both the Galilees Gamala also which was the strongest city in those parts was put under his com mand 5 So every one of the other commanders administered the af fairs of his portion with that alacrity and prudence they were masters of but as to Josephus when he came into Galilee his first care was to gain the good will of the people of that country as sensible that he should thereby have in general good success although he should fail in other points And being concious to himself that if he communicated part of his power to the great men he should make them his fast friends and that he should gain the same favour from the multitude if he executed his commands by persons of their own country and with whom they were well acquainted he chose out  seventy of the most prudent men and those elders in age and appointed them to be rulers of all Galilee as he chose seven judges in every city to hear the lesser quarrels for as to the greater causes and those wherein life and death were concerned he enjoined they should be brought to him and the seventy elders 6 Josephus also when he had settled these rulesfor

as Exod xviii 25 Deut i 15 and in his charge against the offences common among soldiers as Deut xxiii 6 in all which he shewed his great wisdom and piety and skilful conduct in martial affairs Yet may we discern in his very high character of Ananus the high priest B IV ch v Â a who seems to have been the same who conducted St James Bishop of Jerusa Jem to be stoned under Albinus the procurator ttiat when he wrote these book of the War he was not so much as an Ebionite Christian otherwise he would not have failed according to his usual cnstom to have reckoned this his barbarous murder as a just punishment upon him for that his cruelty to the chief or rather only Christian bishop of the circumcision Nor had he been then a Christian could he immediately have spoken so movirgly of the causes of the destruction of Jerusalem without one word of either jhe condemnation of James or c of Ohrist as he did when he was become a Christian afterward VOL III 3 I 434 WARS or THE JEWS Book II against external violence and as he knew the Romans would fall upon Galilee he built walls in proper places about Jatapata and Barsabee and Selamis and besides these about Capharec cho and Japha and Sigo and what they call Mount Tabor and Tariqheae and Tiberias Moreover he built walls about the caves near the lake of Gennesar which places lay in the Lower Galilee the same he did to the places of Upper Galilee as well as to the rock called the Rock of the Achabari and to S ph and Jamneh and Meroth and in Gaulanitis he fortified Selucia and Sogane and Gamala but as to those of Sepphoris they were the only people to whom he gave leave to build their own walls and this because he perceived they were rich and wealthy and ready to go to war without standing in need of any injunctions for that purpose The case was the same with Gischala which had a wall built about it by John the son of Levi himself but with the consent of Josephus but for the building of the rest of the fortresses he laboured together with all the other build ers and was present to give all the necessary orders for that purpose He also got together an army out of Galilee of more than an hundred thousand young men all of which he armed with the old weapons which he had collected together and pre pared for them 7 And when he had considered that the Roman power became invincible chiefly by their readiness in obejing orders and the constant exercise of their arms he despaired of teaching these his men the use of their arms which was to be obtained by ex perience but observing that their readiness in obeying orders was owing to the multitude of their officers he made his parti tions in his army more after the Roman manner and appointed a great many subalterns He also distributed the soldiers into various classes whom he put under captains of tens and captains of hundreds and then under captains of thousands and besides these he had commanders of largerbodies of men Healsotaught them to give the signals one to another and to call and recal the soldiers by the trumpets how to expand the wings of an army and make them wheel about and when one wing hath had suc cess to turn again andassist those that were hard set and to join in the defence of what had most suffered He also continually instructed them in what concerned the courage of the soul and the hardiness of the body and above all he exercised them for war by declaring to them distinctly the good order of the Ro mans and that they were to fight with men who both by the strength of their bodies and courage of their souls had con quered in a manner the whole habitable earth He told them that he should make trial of the good order they would observe in war i Chap XXI WARS OF THE JEWS 435 war even before it came to any battle in case they would ab stain from the crimes they used to indulge themselves in such as theft and robbery and rapine and from defrauding their own countrymen and never to esteem the harm done to those that were so near of kin to them to be any advantage to them selves  for that wars are then managed the best when the war riors preserve a good conscience  but that such as are ill men in private life will not only have those for enemies which at tack them but God himself also for their antagonist 8 And thus did he continue to admonish them Now he chose for the war such an army as was sufficient i e sixty thousand footmen and two hundred and fifty horsemen and besides these on which he put the greatest trust theie were about four thousand five hundred mercenaries he had also six hundred men as guards of his body Now the cities easily maintained the rest of his army excepting the mercenaries for every one of the ci ties enumerated above sent out half their men to the army and retained the other half at home in order to get provisions for  them insomuch that the one part went to the war and the other part to their work and so those that sent out their corn were paid for it by those that were in arms by that security which they enjoyed from them CHAP XXI Concerning John ofGiscbala Jotepbus uses stratagems against the plots John laid against him  and recovers certain cities which bad revolted from him Â 1 V TO Was Josephus was thusengagedin the administration  LNI of the affairs of Galilee there arose a treacherous person a man of Gischala the son of Levi whose name was John His character was that of a very cunning and very knavish person beyond the ordinary rate of the other men of eminence there and for wicked practices he had not his fellow any where Poor he was at first and for a long time his wants were an hinderance to him in his wicked designs He was a ready liar and yet very sharp in gaining credit to his fictions he thought it a point of virtue to delude people and would delude even such as were the dearest to him He was an hypocritical pretender to humanity but where he had hopes of gain he spared not the shedding of blood his desires were ever carried to great  I should think that an army of 60 000 footmen should require many more than 2 co hortemen  and we find Josephus had more horsemen under his command than 250 in his f n ire history 1 suppose he number of the thousands is dropt in our present copies 3 I 2 43 6 WARS OF THE JEWS Book II great things and he encouraged his hopes from those mean wick ed tricks which he was the author of He had a peculiar knack at thieving but in some time he got certain companions in his impudent practices at first they were but few but as he pro ceeded on in his evil course they became still more and more numerous He took care that none of his partners should be easily caught in their rogueries but chose such out of the rest as had the strongest constitutions of body and the greatest cou rage of soul together with great skill in martial affairs so he got together a band of four hundred men who came principally out of the country of Tyre and were vagabonds that had run away from its villages and by the means of these he laid waste all Galilee and irritated a considerable number who were in great expectation of a war then suddenly to arise among them 2 However John s want of money had hitherto restrained him in his ambition after command and in his attempts to advance himself But when he saw that Josephus was highly pleased with the activity of his temper he persuaded him in the first place to intrust him with the repairing of the walls of his na tive city Gischala in which work he got a great deal of mo ney from the rich citizens He after that contrived a very shrewd trick and pretending that the Jews who dwelt in Syria were obliged to make use of oil that was made by others than those of their own nation he desired leave of Josephus to send oil to their borders so he bought four amphorae with such Ty rian money as was of the value of four Attic drachmae and1 sold every half amphoric at the same price And as Galilee was very fruitful in oil and was peculiarly so at that time by sending away great quantities and having the sole privilege so 10 do he gathered an immense sum of money together which money he immeditatelyusedtothe disadvantage of him who gave him that privilege and as he supposed that if he could once overthrow Josephus he shouldhimself obtain the government of Galilee so he gave order to the robbers that were under his command to be more zealous in their thievish expeditions that by the rise of many that desired innovations in the country he might either catch their general in his snares as he came to the country s assistance and then kill him or if he should overlook the robbers he might accuse him for his negligence to the peo ple of the country He also s pread abroad a report far and near that Josephus was delivering up the administration of affairs to the Romans and many such plots did he lay in order tÂ ruin him 3 Now at the same time that ceftian young men of the vil lage Dabaritta who kept guard in the great plain laid snar S for Chap XXI WARS OF THE JEWS 431 I for Ptolemy who was Agrippa s and Bernice s steward and took from him all that he had with him among which things there were a great many costly garments and no small number of sil ver cups and six hundred pieces of gold yet were they notable to conceal what they had stolen but brought it all to Josephns to Taricheae Hereupon he blamed them for the violence they had offered to the king and queen and deposited what they brought to him with Eneas the most potent man of TaricheÂ B with an intention of sending the things back to the owners at a proper time which act of Josephus brought him into the greatest danger for those that had stolen the things had an indignation at him both because they gained no share of it for themselves and because they perceived before hand what was Josephus s in tention and that he would freely deliver up what had cost them so much pains to the king and queen These ran away by night to their several villages and declared to all men that Josephus was going to betray them they also raised great disorders in all the neighbouring cities insomuch that in the morning an hun dred thousand armed men came running together which multi tude was crowded together in the hippodrome at Taricheae and made a very peevish clamour against him while some cried out That  they should depose the traitor and others  That  they should burn him Now John irritated a great many as did also one Jesus the son of Sapphias who was then go vernor of Tiberias Then it was that Josephus s friends and the guards of his body were so affrighted at this violent assault of the multitude that they all fled away but four and as he was asleep they awaked him as the people were going to set fire to the house And although those four that remained with him persuaded him to run away he was neither surprised at his being himself deserted nor at the great multitude that came against him but leaped out to them with his clothes rent and ashes sprinkled on his head with his hands behind him and his sword hanging at his neck At this sight his friends especially those of Taricheae commiserated his condition but those that came out of the country and those in their neighbourhood to whom his government seemed burdensome reproached him and bid him produce the money which belonged to them all imme diately and to Confess the agreement he had made to betray them for they imagined from the habit in which he appeared that he would deny nothing of what they suspected concerning him and that it was in order to obtain pardon that he had put himself entirely into so pitiable a posture But this humble ap pearance was only designed as preparatory to a stratagem of his who thereby contrived to set those that were so angry at him at 438 WARS OF THE JEWS Book II at variance one with another about the things they were angry at However he promised he would confess all hereupon he was permitted to speak when he said  I did neither intend to  send this money back to Agrippa nor to gain it myself for  I did never esteem one that was your enemy to be my friend  nor did 1 look upon what would tend to your disadvantage to  be my advantage But O you people of Taricheae I saw  that your city stood in more need than others of fortifications  for your security and that it wanted money in order for the  building it a wall I was also afraid lest the pepoleof Tibe  Has and other cities should lay a plot to seize upon these spoils  and therefore it was that I intended to retain this money pri  vately that I might encompass you with a wall But if this  does not please you 1 will produce what was brought me  and leave it to you to plunder it but if I have conducted  myself so well as to please you you may if you please punish  your benefactor 4 Hereupon the people of Taricheae loudly commended him but those of Tiberias with the rest of the company gave him hard names and threatened what they would do to him so both sides left off quarrelling with Josephus and fell on quarrelling with one another So he grew bold upon the dependence he had on his friends which were the people of Taricheae and about forty thousand in number and spake more freely to the whole multitude and reproached them greatly for their rashness and told them That  with this money he would build walls about  Taricheae and would put the other cities in a state of secu  rity also for that they should not want money if they would  but agree for whose benefit it was to be procured and would  not suffer themselves to be irritated against him who procured  it for them 5 Hereupon the rest of the multitude that had been deluded retired but yet so that they went away angry and two thou sand of them made an assault upon him in their armour and as he was already gone to his own house they stood without Mid threatened him On which occasion Josephus again used a second stratagem to escape them for he got upon the top of his house and with his right hand desired them to be silent and said to them  I cannot tell what you would have nor can hear what you say  for the confused noiseyoumake but hesaidthathe would com  ply with all their demands in case they would but send some  of their number in to him that might talk with him about it And when the principal of them with their leaders heard this they came into the house He then drew them to the most re tired part of the house and shut the door of that hall where he put Chap XXI WARS OF THE JEWS 430 put them and then had them whipped till every one of their in ward parts appeared naked In the mean time the multitude stood round the house and supposed that he had a long discourse with those that were gone in about what they claimed of him He had then the doors set open immediately and sent the men out all bloody which so terribly affrighted those that had before threatened him that they threw away their arms and ran away 6 But as for John his envy grew greater upon this escape of Josephus and he framed a new plot against him he pre tended to be sick and by a letter desired that Josephus would give him leave to use the hot baths that were at Tiberias for the recovery of his health Hereupon Josephus who hitherto suspected nothing of John s plots against him wrote to the go vernors of the city that they would provide a lodging and necessaries for John which favours when he had made use of in two days time he did what he came about some he cor rupted with delusive frauds and others with money and so per suaded them to revolt from Josephus This Silas who was ap pointed guardian of the city by Josephus wrote to him imme diately and informed him of the plot against him which epistle when Josephus had received he marched with great diligence all night and came early in the morning to Tiberias at which time the rest of the multitude met him But John who sus pected that coming was not for his advantage sent however one of his friends and pretended that he was sick and that being confined to his bed he could not come to pay him his respects But as soon as Josephus had got the people of Tiberias to gether in the Stadium and tried to discourse with them a bout the letters that he had received John privately sent some armed men and gave them orders to slay him But when the people saw that the armed men were about to draw their swords they cried out at which cry Josephus turned him self about and when he saw that the swords were just at his throat he marched away in great haste to the sea shore and left off that speech which he was going to make to the people upon an elevation of six cubits high He then seized on a ship which lav in the haven and leaped into it with two of his guards and fled away into the midst of the lake 1 But now the soldiers he had with him took up their arms immediately and marched against the plotters but Josephus was afraid lest a civil war should be raised by the envy of a few men and bring the city to rum so he sent some of his party to tell them that they should do no more than provide for their own safety that they should not kill anybody nor accuse any for the occasion they had afforded of a disorder Accordingly these jnen obeyed his orders and were quiet but the people of the neighbouring 440 WARS OF THE JEWS Book II neighbouring country when they were informed of this plot and of the plotter they got together in great multitudes to op pose John But he prevented their attempt and fled away to Gischala his native city while the Galileans came running out of their several cities to Josephus and as they were now become many ten thousands of armed men they cried out that they were come against John the common plotter against their interest and would at chesame time burn him and that city which had received him Hereupon Josephus told them that he took their good will to him kindly but still he restrained their fury and intend ed to subdue his enemies by prudent conduct rather than by slaying them  so he excepted those of every city which had join ed in this revolt with John by name who had readily been shewed him by these that came from every city and caused pub lic proclamation to be made that he would seize uppn the effects of those that d id not forsake J ohn within five days time and would burn both their houses and their families with fire Whereupon three thousand of John s party left him immediately who came to Josephus and threw their arms down at his feet John then betook himself together with his two thousand Syriaan runa gates from open attempts to more secret ways of treachery Accordingly he privatelysent messengers to Jerusalem to accuse Josephus as having too great power and to let them know that he would soon come as a tyrant to their metropolis unless they prevented him This accusation the people were aware of beforehand but had no regard to it However some of the grandees out of envy and some of the rulers also sent money to John privately that he might be able to get together mercenary soldiers in order to fight Josephus they also made a decree of themselves and this for recalling him from his government yet did they not think that decree sufficient so they sent withal two thousand five hundred armed men and four persons of the high est rank amongst them Joarar the son of Nomicus and Ana nias the son of Sadduk as alsoSimon and Judas the sons of Jona than all veryablemen in speaking that these personsmightwith draw the good will of the people from Josephus These had itin charge if he would voluntarily come away they should permit him to come and give an account of his conduct but if he obstinr ately insisted upon his continuing in his government they should treat him as an enemy Now Josephus s friends had sent him word that an army was coming against him but they gave no notice beforehand what the reason of their coming was that being oily known among some secret councils of his enemies and by this means it was that four cities revolted from him imme diately Sepphoris and Gamala and Gischala and 1 iberias Ytt did he recover these cijies without war and when he had routed Chap XXI WARS OF THE JEWS 441 routed those four commanders by stratagems and had taken the most potent of their warriors he sent them to Jerusalem  and the people of Galilee had great indignation at them and were in a zealous disposition to slay not only these forces but those that sent them also had not these forces prevented it by running  away 8 Now John was detained afterward within the walls of Gischala by the fear he was in of Josephus but within a few days Tiberias revolted again the people within it inviting King Agrippa to return to the exercise of his authority there And when he did not come at the time appointed and when a few Roman horsemen appeared that day they expelled Josephus out of the city Now this revolt of theirs was presently known at Taricheae and as Josephus had sent out all the soldiers that were with him to gather corn he knew not how either to march out alone against the revolters or to stay where he was because he was afraid the king s soldiers might prevent him if he tar ried and might get into the city  for he did not intend to do any thing on the next day because it was the Sabbath day and would hinder his proceeding So he contrived to circumvent the revohers by a stratagem and in the first place he ordered the gates of Taricheae to be shut that nobody might go out and inform those of Tiberias for whom it was intended what stratagem he was about he then got together all the ships that were upon the lake which were found to be two hundred and thirty and in each of them he put no more than four mariners So he sailed to Tiberias with haste and kept at such a distance from the city that it was not easy for the people to see the ves sels and ordered that the empty vessels should float up and down there while himself who had but seven of his guards with him and those unarmed also went so near as to be seen  but when his adversaries who were still reproaching him saw him from the walls they were so astonished that they supposed all the ships were full of armed men and threw down their arms and by signals of intercession they besought him to spare the city 9 Upon this Josephus threatened them terribly and reproach ed them that when they were the first that took up arms against the Romans they should spend their force before hand in civil dissensions and do what their enemies desired above all things and that besides they should endeavour so hastily to seize upon him who took care of their safety and had not been ashamed to shut the gates of their city against him that built their walls  that however he would admit of any intercessors from them that might make some excuse for them and with whom he would make such agreements as might be for the city s se curity Hereupon ten of the most potent men of Tiberias came VOL 111 3 K down 4V2 WARS OF THE JEWS Book II down to him presently and when he had taken them into one of his vessels he ordered them to be carried a great way off from the city He then commanded that fifty others of their senate such as were men of the greatest eminence should come to him that they also might give him some security on their behalf After which under one new pretence or another he called forth others one after another to make the leagues between them He then gave order to the masters of those vessels which he had thus filled to sail away immediately for Taricheae and to con fine those men in the prison there till at length he took all their senate consisting of six hundred persons and about two thousand of the populace and carried them away to Tarichea 10 And when the rest of the people cried out that it was one Clitus that was the chief author of this revolt they desired him to spend his anger upon him only but Josephus whose in tention it was to slay nobody commanded one Levius belonging to his guards to go out of the vessel in order to cut off both Glitus s hands yet was Levius afraid to go out by himself alone to such a large body of enemies and refused to go Now Clitus saw that Josephus was in a great passion in the ship and ready to leap out of it in order to execute the punishment him self he begged therefore from the shore that he would leave him one of his hands which Josephus agreed to upon condition that he would himself cut off the other hand accordingly he drew his sword and with his right hand cut off his left so great was the fear he was in of Josephus himself And thus he took the people of Tiberias prisoners and recovered the city again with empty shius  and seven of his guard Moreover a few days afterward he retook Gischala which had revolted with the Tropic of Sepphoris and gave his soldiers leave to plunder it vet did he get all the plunder together and restored it to the in habitants and the like he did to the inhabitants of Sepphoris and Tiberias For when he had subdued those cities he had a mind by letting them be plundered to give them some good instruction while at the same time he regained their good will by restoring them their money again CHAP XXII The

multitude of the young men were engaged in exer cises without any regularity and all places were full of tu multuous doings but the moderate sort were exceedingly sad and a great many there were who out of the prospect they had of the calamities that were coming upon them made great la mentations There were also such omens observed as were un derstood to be forerunners of evils by such as loved peace but were by those that kindled thejwar interpreted so as to suit their own inclinations  and the very state of the city even b efore the Romans came against it was that of a place doomed to destruc tion However Ananus s concern was this to lay aside for a while the preparations for the war and to persuade the seditious to consult their own interest and to restrain the madness of those that had the name of zealots  but their violence was too hard for him and what end he came to we shall relate hereafter 2 But as for the Acrabbene tpparchy Simon the son of Gioras got a great number of those that were fond of innova tions together and betook himself to ravage the country nor did he only harrass the rich mens houses but tormented their bodies and appeared openly and before hand to
